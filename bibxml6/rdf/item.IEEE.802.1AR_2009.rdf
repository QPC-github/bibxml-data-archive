        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1AR_2009: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks - Secure Device Identity, </title>
        <dc:date>2009-12-28T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A secure device identifier (DevID) is cryptographically bound to a device and supports authentication of the devices identity. Locally significant identities can be securely associated with an initial manufacturer-provisioned DevID and used in provisioning and authentication protocols toallow a network administrator to establish the trustworthiness of a device and select appropriate policies for transmission and reception of data and control protocols to and from the device. </description>
