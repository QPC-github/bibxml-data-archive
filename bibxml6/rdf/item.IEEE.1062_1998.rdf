        <title>RFC IEEE.1062_1998: IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Acquisition, </title>
        <dc:date>1988-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A set of useful quality practices that can be selected and applied during one or more steps in a software acquisition process is described. This recommended practice can be applied to software that runs on any computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of the software, but is more suited for use on modified-off-the-shelf software and fully developed software. </description>
