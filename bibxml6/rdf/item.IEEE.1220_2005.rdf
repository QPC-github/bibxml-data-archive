        <title>RFC IEEE.1220_2005: IEEE Standard for Application and Management of the Systems Engineering Process, </title>
        <dc:date>2005-09-26T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The interdisciplinary tasks, which are required throughout a system's life cycle to transform customer needs, requirements, and constraints into a system solution, are defined. In addition, the requirements for the systems engineering process and its application throughout the product life cycle are specified. The focus of this standard is on engineering activities necessary to guide product development while ensuring that the product is properly designed to make it affordable to produce, own, operate, maintain, and eventually to dispose of, without undue risk to health or the environment. </description>
