        <title>RFC IEEE.29148_2011: Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering, </title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-06T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 contains provisions for the processes and products related to the engineering of requirements for systems and software products and services throughout the life cycle. It defines the construct of a good requirement, provides attributes and characteristics of requirements, and discusses the iterative and recursive application of requirements processes throughout the life cycle. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 provides additional guidance in the application of requirements engineering and management processes for requirements-related activities in ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288. Information items applicable to the engineering of requirements and their content are defined. The content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 can be added to the existing set of requirements-related life cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC 12207 or ISO/IEC 15288, or can be used independently. </description>
