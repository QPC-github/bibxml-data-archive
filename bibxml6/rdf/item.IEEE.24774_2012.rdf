        <title>RFC IEEE.24774_2012: IEEE Guide--Adoption of ISO/IEC TR 24474:2010 Systems and Software Engineering-- Life Cycle Management--Guidelines for Process Description, </title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-26T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>An increasing number of international, national and industry standards describe process models. These models are developed for a range of purposes including process implementation and assessment. The terms and descriptions used in such models vary in format, content and level of prescription. ISO/IEC TR 24774:2010 presents guidelines for the elements used most frequently in describing a process: the title, purpose, outcomes, activities, task and information item. Whilst the primary purpose of ISO/IEC TR 24774:2010 is to encourage consistency in standard process reference models, the guidelines it provides can be applied to any process model developed for any purpose. </description>
