        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1X_2010: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks - Port-Based Network Access Control, </title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-08T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to restrict the use of IEEE 802 LAN service access points (ports) to secure communication between authenticated and authorized devices. This standard specifies a common architecture, functional elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and that secure communication between the ports, including the media access method independent protocols that are used to discover and establish the security associations used by IEEE 802.1AETM MAC Security. </description>
