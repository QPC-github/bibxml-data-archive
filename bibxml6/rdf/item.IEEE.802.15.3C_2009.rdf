        <title>RFC IEEE.802.15.3C_2009: IEEE Standard for Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements. Part 15.3: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for High Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) Amendment 2: Millimeter-wave-based Alternative Physical Layer Extension, </title>
        <dc:date>2009-10-09T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This amendment defines an alternative physical layer (PHY) for IEEE Std 802.15.3-2003. Three PHY modes have been defined that enable data rates in excess of 5 Gb/s using the 60 GHz band. A beamforming protocol has been defined to improve the range of communicating devices. Aggregation and block acknowledgment have been defined to improve the medium access control (MAC) efficiency at the high data rates provided for by the PHY. </description>
