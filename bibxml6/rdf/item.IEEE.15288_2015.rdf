        <title>RFC IEEE.15288_2015: ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes, </title>
        <dc:date>2015-05-13T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A common framework for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans is established by this standard. It defines a set of processes and associated terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. </description>
