        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1AXBK_2012: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks--Link Aggregation Amendment 1: Protocol Addressing, </title>

        <description>Link Aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group, such that a Media Access Control (MAC) Client can treat the Link Aggregation Group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full-duplex, point-to-point links operating at the same data rate. The MAC independent Link Aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support Link Aggregation, are defined in this standard. </description>
