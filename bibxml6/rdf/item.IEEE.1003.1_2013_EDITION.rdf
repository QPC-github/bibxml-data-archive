        <description>POSIX.1-2008 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 and The Open Group Technical Standard BaseSpecifications, Issue 7. This 2013 Edition includes IEEE Std 1003.1-2008/Cor 1-2013 incorporated into IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (the base document). The Technical Corrigendum addresses problems discovered since the approval of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008. POSIX.1-2008 defines a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or shell), and common utility programs to support applications portability at the source code level. POSIX.1-2008 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume). </description>
