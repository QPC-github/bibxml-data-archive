        <title>RFC IEEE.802.5T_2000: IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Telecommunications and Information Exchange Between Systems - Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Specific Requirements. Amendment to Part 5: Token Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications, </title>
        <dc:date>1988-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This supplement specifies the changes required to ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5, 1998 Edition, (Base standard) and ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5r, 1998 Edition, and ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5j, 1998 Edition, (Amendment 1 standard) to support 100 Mbit/s dedicated token ring (DTR) operation. The Base standard, together with the Amendment 1 standard, specifies shared and dedicated (point-to-point) token ring operation at both 4 Mbit/s and 16 Mbit/s using either the TKP access protocol or the TXI access protocol. This supplement extends token ring operation to 100 Mbit/s for the DTR C-port and station using the TXI access protocol. Extensions to the medium access control (MAC) have been made to accommodate the requirements for high media rates (100 Mbit/s and above). </description>
