        <title>RFC IEEE.1320.2_1998: IEEE Standard for Conceptual Modeling Language Syntax and Semantics for IDEF1X/Sub 97/ (IDEF/Sub Object/), </title>
        <dc:date>1988-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IDEF1X/sub 97/ consists of two conceptual modeling languages. The key-style language supports data/information modeling and is downward compatible with the US government's 1993 standard, FIPS PUB 184. The identity-style language is based on the object model with declarative rules and constraints. IDEF1X/sub 97/ identity style includes constructs for the distinct but related components of object abstraction: interface, requests, and realization; utilizes graphics to state the interface; and defines a declarative, directly executable Rule and Constraint Language for requests and realizations. IDEF1X/sub 97/ conceptual modeling supports implementation by relational databases, extended relational databases, object databases, and object programming languages. IDEF1X/sub 97/ is formally defined in terms of first order logic. A procedure is given whereby any valid IDEF1X/sub 97/ model can be transformed into an equivalent theory in first order logic. That procedure is then applied to a meta model of IDEF1X/sub 97/ to define the valid set of IDEF1X/sub 97/ models. </description>
