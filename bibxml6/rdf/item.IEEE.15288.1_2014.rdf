        <title>RFC IEEE.15288.1_2014: IEEE Standard for Application of Systems Engineering on Defense Programs, </title>
        <dc:date>2015-05-11T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The requirements for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, System Life Cycle Processes for defense systems engineering needs are provided in this standard. This standard implements ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use by United States Department of Defense (DoD) organizations and other defense agencies in acquiring systems or systems engineering support. While primarily supporting the acquirer-supplier agreement mode, this standard also can be used to support the other modes: use by organizations, projects, and process assessors. This standard provides the basis for selection, negotiation, agreement, and performance of necessary systems engineering activities and delivery of products, while allowing flexibility for both innovative implementation and tailoring of the specific systems engineering process(es) to be used by system suppliers, either contractors or government system developers,integrators, maintainers, or sustainers. </description>
