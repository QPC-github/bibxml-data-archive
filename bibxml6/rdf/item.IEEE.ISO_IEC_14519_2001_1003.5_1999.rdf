        <title>RFC IEEE.ISO_IEC_14519_2001_1003.5_1999: IEEE Standard for Information Technology - POSIX(R) Ada Language Interfaces - Part 1: Binding for System Application Program Interface (API) - Amendment 2: Protocol-Independent Interfaces, </title>
        <dc:date>1988-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This standard is part of the POSIX series of standards for applications and user interfaces to open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying textual descriptions of the application program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the source code level through the binding between ISO 8652: 1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1996) (POSIX), as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology and general requirements, process primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primitives, device- and class-specific functions, language-specific services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory management, execution scheduling clocks and timers, message passing, task management, the XTI and sockets detailed network interfaces, event management, network support functions, and protocol-specific mappings are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada compilation system. </description>
