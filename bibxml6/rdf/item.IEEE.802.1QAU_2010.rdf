        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1QAU_2010: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks-- Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks Amendment 13: Congestion Notification, </title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-26T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This amendment specifies protocols, procedures and managed objects that support congestion management of long-lived data flows within network domains of limited bandwidth-delay product. This is achieved by enabling bridges to signal congestion to end stations capable of transmission rate limiting to avoid frame loss. </description>
