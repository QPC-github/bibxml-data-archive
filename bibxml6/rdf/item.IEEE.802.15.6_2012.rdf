        <title>RFC IEEE.802.15.6_2012: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks - Part 15.6: Wireless Body Area Networks, </title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-29T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Short-range, wireless communications in the vicinity of, or inside, a human body (but not limited to humans) are specified in this standard. It uses existing industrial scientific medical (ISM) bands as well as frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory authorities. Support for quality of service (QoS), extremely low power, and data rates up to 10 Mbps is required while simultaneously complying with strict non-interference guidelines where needed. This standard considers effects on portable antennas due to the presence of a person (varying with male, female, skinny, heavy, etc.), radiation pattern shaping to minimize the specific absorption rate (SAR) into the body, and changes in characteristics as a result of the user motions. </description>
