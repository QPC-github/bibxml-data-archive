        <description>ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 is adopted by this standard. ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 is a guide for the application of ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It addresses system, life cycle, process, organizational, project, and adaptation concepts, principally through reference to ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008. It gives guidance on applying ISO/IEC 12207:2008 from the aspects of strategy, planning, application in organizations, and application on projects. ISO/IEC TR 24748-3:2011 is intentionally aligned with both ISO/IEC TR 24748-1 and ISO/IEC TR 24748-2 (Guide to the application of lSO/lEC 15288) in its terminology, structure and content. </description>
