        <title>RFC IEEE.1175.3_2004: IEEE Standard for CASE Tool Interconnections-Reference Model for Specifying Software Behavior, </title>
        <dc:date>2004-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this standard is to specify a common set of modeling concepts based on those found in commercial CASE tools for describing the operational behavior of a software product. This standard establishes a uniform, integrated model of software concepts related to software functionality. It also provides a textual syntax for expressing the common properties (attributes and relationships) of those concepts as they have been used to model software behavior. The 1175.3 exchange syntax is both machine-processable and human-readable. </description>
