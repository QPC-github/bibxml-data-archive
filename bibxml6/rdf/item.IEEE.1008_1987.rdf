        <title>RFC IEEE.1008_1987: IEEE Standard for Software Unit Testing, </title>
        <dc:date>2002-12-10T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The standard is presented. The primary objective is to specify a standard approach to software unit testing that can be used as a basis for sound software engineering practice. A second objective is to describe the software engineering concepts and testing assumptions on which the standard approach is based. A third objective is to provide guidance and resource information to assist with the implementation and usage of the standard unit testing approach.> </description>
