        <title>RFC IEEE.802.15.4_2011: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks--Part 15.4: Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs), </title>
        <dc:date>2011-09-05T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wire less personal area network (WPAN) were defined in IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006. In this revision, the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4 is extended, the ambiguities in the standard are removed, and the improvements learned from implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006 are included. </description>
