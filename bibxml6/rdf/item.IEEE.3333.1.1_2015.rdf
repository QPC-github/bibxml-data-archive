        <title>RFC IEEE.3333.1.1_2015: IEEE Standard for Quality of Experience (QoE) and Visual-Comfort Assessments of Three-Dimensional (3D) Contents Based on Psychophysical Studies, </title>
        <dc:date>2015-07-10T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>As the demand and supply for 3D technologies grows, the development of accurate quality-assessment techniques shall be used to develop the 3D display device and signal-processing engine industries. The underlying principles and statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on the human visual system (HVS) are described in this standard. In addition, a reliable 3D subjective assessment methodology that covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism, and the viewing environment is introduced in this standard. </description>
