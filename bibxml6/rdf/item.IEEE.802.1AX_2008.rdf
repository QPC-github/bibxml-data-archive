        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1AX_2008: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks--Link Aggregation, </title>
        <dc:date>2008-11-07T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Link aggregation allows one or more links to be aggregated together to form a link aggregation group, such that a media access control (MAC) client can treat the link aggregation group as if it were a single link. To this end, it specifies the establishment of data terminal equipment (DTE) to DTE logical links, consisting of N parallel instances of full duplex point-to-point links operating at the same data rate. This standard defines the MAC independent link aggregation capability, and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support link aggregation. </description>
