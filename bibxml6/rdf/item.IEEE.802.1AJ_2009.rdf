        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1AJ_2009: IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks - Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks Amendment 11: Two-Port Media Access Control (Mac) Relay, </title>
        <dc:date>2009-12-31T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This amendment to IEEE Std 802.1 Q specifies the function of a MAC Relay with two MACs, and the protocols and procedures to support its operation. A MAC Relay is transparent to all frame-based media independent protocols except those explicitly addressed to this device. It is remotely manageable through at least one of its external MACs, and signals a failure of either MAC'S LAN through the other MAC. </description>
