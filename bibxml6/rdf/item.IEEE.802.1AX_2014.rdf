        <title>RFC IEEE.802.1AX_2014: IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks -- Link Aggregation, </title>
        <dc:date>2014-12-24T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general information relevant to specific MAC types are defined in this standard. Link Aggregation allows parallel full-duplex point-to-point links to be used as if they were a single link and also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient load sharing interconnect between multiple nodes in two separately administered networks. </description>
