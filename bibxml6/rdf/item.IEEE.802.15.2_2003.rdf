        <title>RFC IEEE.802.15.2_2003: IEEE Recommended Practice for Information technology-- Local and metropolitan area networks-- Specific requirements-- Part 15.2: Coexistence of Wireless Personal Area Networks with Other Wireless Devices Operating in Unlicensed Frequency Bands, </title>
        <dc:date>2003-10-20T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This recommended practice addresses the issue of coexistence of wireless local area networks and wireless personal area networks. These wireless networks often operate in the same unlicensed band. This recommended practice describes coexistence mechanisms that can be used to facilitate coexistence of wireless local area networks (i.e., IEEE Std 802.11b-1999) and wireless personal area networks (i.e., IEEE Std 802.15.1-2002).
