        <title>RFC 4721: Mobile IPv4 Challenge/Response Extensions (Revised), C. Perkins, P. Calhoun, J. Bharatia</title>
        <dc:date>2007-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Furthermore, this document updates RFC 3344 by including a new authentication extension called the Mobile-Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Authentication extension.  This new extension is provided so that a mobile node can supply credentials for authorization, using commonly available AAA infrastructure elements.  This authorization-enabling extension MAY co-exist in the same Registration Request with authentication extensions defined for Mobile IP Registration by RFC 3344.  This document obsoletes RFC 3012.
