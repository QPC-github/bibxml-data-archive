        <title>RFC 5697: Other Certificates Extension, S. Farrell</title>
        <dc:date>2009-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Some applications that associate state information with public key certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates that belong to the same end entity and that can safely be considered equivalent to one another for the purposes of referencing that application-state information.  This memo defines a certificate extension that allows applications to establish the required linkage without introducing a new application protocol data unit.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
