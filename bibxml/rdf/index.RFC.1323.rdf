        <title>RFC 1323: TCP Extensions for High Performance, V. Jacobson, R. Braden, D. Borman</title>
        <dc:date>1992-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance over large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable operation over very high-speed paths.  It defines new TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps, which are designed to provide compatible interworking with TCP's that do not implement the extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
