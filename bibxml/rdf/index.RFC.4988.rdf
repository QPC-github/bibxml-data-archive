        <title>RFC 4988: Mobile IPv4 Fast Handovers, R. Koodli, C. Perkins</title>
        <dc:date>2007-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document adapts the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers to improve delay and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv4 handover operations. Specifically, this document addresses movement detection, IP address configuration, and location update latencies during a handover.  For reducing the IP address configuration latency, the document proposes that the new Care-of Address is always made to be the new access router's IP address.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
