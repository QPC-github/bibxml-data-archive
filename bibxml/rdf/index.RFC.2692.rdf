        <dc:date>1999-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The SPKI Working Group first established a list of things one might want to do with certificates (attached at the end of this document), and then summarized that list of desires into requirements.  This document presents that summary of requirements.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
