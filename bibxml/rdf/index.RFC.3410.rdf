        <title>RFC 3410: Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework, J. Case, R. Mundy, D. Partain, B. Stewart</title>
        <dc:date>2002-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2). The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the Framework over time. The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status. This document obsoletes RFC 2570.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
