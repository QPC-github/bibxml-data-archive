        <title>RFC 2056: Uniform Resource Locators for Z39.50, R. Denenberg, J. Kunze, D. Lynch</title>
        <dc:date>1996-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Z39.50 is an information retrieval protocol that does not fit neatly into a retrieval model designed primarily around the stateless fetch of data.  Instead, it models a general user inquiry as a session-oriented, multi-step task, any step of which may be suspended temporarily while the server requests additional parameters from the client before continuing.
