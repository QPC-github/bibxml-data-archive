        <title>RFC 6833: Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Map-Server Interface, V. Fuller, D. Farinacci</title>
        <dc:date>2013-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>By using this service interface and communicating with Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers are not dependent on the details of mapping database systems, which facilitates experimentation with different database designs. Since these devices implement the "edge" of the LISP infrastructure, connect directly to LISP-capable Internet end sites, and comprise the bulk of LISP-speaking devices, reducing their implementation and operational complexity should also reduce the overall cost and effort of deploying LISP.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol  for the Internet community. </description>
