        <title>RFC 3264: An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP), J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne</title>
        <dc:date>2002-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can make use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to arrive at a common view of a multimedia session between them.  In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective.  This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.  The offer/answer model is used by protocols like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
