        <title>RFC 6586: Experiences from an IPv6-Only Network, J. Arkko, A. Keranen</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses our experiences from moving a small number of users to an IPv6-only network, with access to the IPv4-only parts of the Internet via a NAT64 device.  The document covers practical experiences as well as roadblocks and opportunities for this type of a network setup.  The document also makes some recommendations about where such networks are applicable and what should be taken into account in the network design.  The document also discusses further work that is needed to make IPv6-only networking applicable in all environments.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
