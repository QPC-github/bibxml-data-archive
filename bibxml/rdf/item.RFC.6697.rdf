        <title>RFC 6697: Handover Keying (HOKEY) Architecture Design, G. Zorn, Q. Wu, T. Taylor, Y. Nir, K. Hoeper, S. Decugis</title>
        <dc:date>2012-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the HOKEY architecture.  Specifically, it describes design objectives, the functional environment within which handover keying operates, the functions to be performed by the HOKEY architecture itself, and the assignment of those functions to architectural components.  It goes on to illustrate the operation of the architecture within various deployment scenarios that are described more fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY Working Group.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
