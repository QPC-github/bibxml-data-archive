        <title>RFC 7043: Resource Records for EUI-48 and EUI-64 Addresses in the DNS, J. Abley</title>
        <dc:date>2013-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes potentially severe privacy implications resulting from indiscriminate publication of link-layer addresses in the DNS.  EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses SHOULD NOT be published in the public DNS.  This document specifies an interoperable encoding of these address types for use in private DNS namespaces, where the privacy concerns can be constrained and mitigated. </description>
