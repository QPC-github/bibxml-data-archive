        <title>RFC 1779: A String Representation of Distinguished Names, S. Kille</title>
        <dc:date>1995-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The OSI Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to entries in the directory.  Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1. When a distinguished name is communicated between to users not using a directory protocol (e.g., in a mail message), there is a need to have a user-oriented string representation of distinguished name. This specification defines a string format for representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly used names, whilst being able to represent any distinguished name.
