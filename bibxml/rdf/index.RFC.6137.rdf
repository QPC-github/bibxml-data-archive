        <title>RFC 6137: The Network Trouble Ticket Data Model (NTTDM), D. Zisiadis, S. Kopsidas, M. Tsavli, G. Cessieux</title>

        <description>As a result, management of the daily workload by a central Network Operation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own.  Normalization of TTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation, storing, and handling of the TTs.  In the present document, we provide a model for automating the collection and normalization of the TT received by multiple networks forming the Grid.  Each of the participants is using its home TT system within its domain for handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering the tickets in the normalized format for repository and handling.  XML is used as the common representation language.  The model was defined and used as part of the networking support activity of the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project.  This document defines an  Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
