        <description>This document examines the general framework of Realm Specific IP (RSIP).  RSIP is intended as a alternative to NAT in which the end-to- end integrity of packets is maintained.  We focus on implementation issues, deployment scenarios, and interaction with other layer-three protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
