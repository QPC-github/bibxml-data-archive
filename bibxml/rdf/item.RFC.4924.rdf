        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a review of previous IAB statements on Internet transparency, as well a discussion of new transparency issues.  Far from having lessened in relevance, technical implications of intentionally or inadvertently impeding network transparency play a critical role in the Internet's ability to support innovation and global communication. This document provides some specific illustrations of those potential impacts.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
