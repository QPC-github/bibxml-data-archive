        <title>RFC 6144: Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation, F. Baker, X. Li, C. Bao, K. Yin</title>
        <dc:date>2011-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation.  This is in the context of replacing Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT), which was deprecated by RFC 4966, and to enable networks to have IPv4 and IPv6 coexist in a somewhat rational manner while transitioning to an IPv6 network.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
