        <title>RFC 5922: Domain Certificates in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), V. Gurbani, S. Lawrence, A. Jeffrey</title>
        <dc:date>2010-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to construct and interpret certain information in a PKIX-compliant (Public Key Infrastructure using X.509) certificate for use in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection.  More specifically, this document describes how to encode and extract the identity of a SIP domain in a certificate and how to use that identity for SIP domain authentication.  As such, this document is relevant both to implementors of SIP and to issuers of certificates.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
