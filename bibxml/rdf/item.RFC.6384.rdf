        <title>RFC 6384: An FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for IPv6-to-IPv4 Translation, I. van Beijnum</title>
        <dc:date>2011-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific and as extended, IP version agnostic commands.  The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended passive.  However, many existing FTP servers do not support this mode, and some clients do not ask for it.  This document specifies a middlebox that may solve this mismatch.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
