        <title>RFC 5387: Problem and Applicability Statement for Better-Than-Nothing Security (BTNS), J. Touch, D. Black, Y. Wang</title>
        <dc:date>2008-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document explains the rationale for extending the Internet network security protocol suite to enable use of IPsec security services without authentication.  These extensions are intended to protect communication, providing "better-than-nothing security" (BTNS).  The extensions may be used on their own (this use is called Stand-Alone BTNS, or SAB) or may be used to provide network-layer security that can be authenticated by higher layers in the protocol stack (this use is called Channel-Bound BTNS, or CBB).  The document also explains situations for which use of SAB and/or CBB extensions are applicable.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
