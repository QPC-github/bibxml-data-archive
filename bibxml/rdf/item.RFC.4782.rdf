        <title>RFC 4782: Quick-Start for TCP and IP, S. Floyd, M. Allman, A. Jain, P. Sarolahti</title>

        <description>This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved.  These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start.  These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options.  Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks.  This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path.  As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
