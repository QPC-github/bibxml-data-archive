        <title>RFC 6246: Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Interoperability with Customer Edge (CE) Bridges, A. Sajassi, F. Brockners, D. Mohan, Y. Serbest</title>

        <description>When customer edge (CE) devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues and challenges that need to be accounted for in a VPLS network.  The majority of these issues have been addressed in the IEEE 802.1ad standard for provider bridges and they can be leveraged for VPLS networks.  This document extends the provider edge (PE) model described in RFC 4664 based on IEEE 802.1ad bridge module, and it illustrates a clear demarcation between the IEEE bridge module and IETF LAN emulation module.  By doing so, it shows that the majority of interoperability issues with CE bridges can be delegated to the 802.1ad bridge module, thus removing the burden on the IETF LAN emulation module within a VPLS PE.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
