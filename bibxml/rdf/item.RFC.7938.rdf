        <title>RFC 7938: Use of BGP for Routing in Large-Scale Data Centers, P. Lapukhov, A. Premji, J. Mitchell</title>
        <dc:date>2016-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Some network operators build and operate data centers that support over one hundred thousand servers.  In this document, such data centers are referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes operational experience in designing and operating large-scale data centers using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent is to report on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry. </description>
