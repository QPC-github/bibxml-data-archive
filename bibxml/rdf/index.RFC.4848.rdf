        <title>RFC 4848: Domain-Based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS), L. Daigle</title>
        <dc:date>2007-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this document is to define a new, straightforward Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) application to allow mapping of domain names to URIs for particular application services and protocols.  Although defined as a new DDDS application, dubbed U-NAPTR, this is effectively an extension of the Straightforward NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS Application.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
