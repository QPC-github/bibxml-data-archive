        <title>RFC 7394: Definition of Time to Live TLV for LSP-Ping Mechanisms, S. Boutros, S. Sivabalan, G. Swallow, S. Saxena, V. Manral, S. Aldrin</title>
        <dc:date>2014-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>LSP-Ping is a widely deployed Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism in MPLS networks.  However, in the present form, this mechanism is inadequate to verify connectivity of a segment of a Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) and/or bidirectional co-routed Label Switched Path (LSP) from any node on the path of the MS-PW  and/or bidirectional co-routed LSP.  This document defines a TLV to address this shortcoming. </description>
