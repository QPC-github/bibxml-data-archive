        <title>RFC 4980: Analysis of Multihoming in Network Mobility Support, C. Ng, T. Ernst, E. Paik, M. Bagnulo</title>

        <description>This document is an analysis of multihoming in the context of network mobility (NEMO) in IPv6.  As there are many situations in which mobile networks may be multihomed, a taxonomy is proposed to classify the possible configurations.  The possible deployment scenarios of multihomed mobile networks are described together with the associated issues when network mobility is supported by RFC 3963 (NEMO Basic Support).  Recommendations are offered on how to address these issues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
