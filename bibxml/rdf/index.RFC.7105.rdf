        <title>RFC 7105: Using Device-Provided Location-Related Measurements in Location Configuration Protocols, M. Thomson, J. Winterbottom</title>
        <dc:date>2014-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location-related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information provides observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device; this information could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters. </description>
