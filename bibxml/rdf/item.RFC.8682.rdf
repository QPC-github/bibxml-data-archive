        <title>RFC 8682: TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), M. Saito, M. Matsumoto, V. Roca, E. Baccelli</title>
        <dc:date>2020-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the TinyMT32 Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), which produces 32-bit pseudorandom unsigned integers and aims at having a simple-to-use and deterministic solution. This PRNG is a small-sized variant of the Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNG. The main advantage of TinyMT32 over MT is the use of a small internal state, compatible with most target platforms that include embedded devices, while keeping reasonably good randomness that represents a significant improvement compared to the Park-Miller Linear Congruential PRNG. However, neither the TinyMT nor MT PRNG is meant to be used for cryptographic applications. </description>
