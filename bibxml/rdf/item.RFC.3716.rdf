        <title>RFC 3716: IETF in the Large:  Administration and Execution, </title>
        <dc:date>2004-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In the fall of 2003, the IETF Chair and the IAB Chair formed an IAB Advisory Committee (AdvComm), with a mandate to review the existing IETF administrative structure and relationships (RFC Editor, IETF Secretariat, IANA) and to propose changes to the IETF management process or structure to improve the overall functioning of the IETF.  The AdvComm mandate did not include the standards process itself.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
