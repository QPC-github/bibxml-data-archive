        <title>RFC 0977: Network News Transfer Protocol, B. Kantor, P. Lapsley</title>
        <dc:date>1986-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval, and    posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of    news among the ARPA-Internet community.  NNTP is designed so that news    articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to    select only those items he wishes to read.  Indexing, cross-referencing,    and expiration of aged messages are also provided. This RFC suggests a    proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests    discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
