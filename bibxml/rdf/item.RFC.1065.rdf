        <dc:date>1988-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC provides the common definitions for the structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, together with its companion memos, which describe the initial management information base along with the initial network management protocol, these documents provide a simple, working architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular, the Internet. This memo specifies a draft standard for the Internet community.  TCP/IP implementation in the Internet which are network manageable are expected to adopt and implement this specification. </description>
