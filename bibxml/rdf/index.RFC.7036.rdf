        <dc:date>2013-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When the Long-Term Archive and Notary Services (LTANS) working group was chartered, an object identifier arc was set aside for use by that working group.  This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned, and it establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc. </description>
