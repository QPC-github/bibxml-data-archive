        <title>RFC 4279: Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS), P. Eronen, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2005-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on pre-shared keys (PSKs).  These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys, shared in advance among the communicating parties.  The first set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations for authentication. The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key, and the third set combines public key authentication of the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.
