        <title>RFC 8724: SCHC: Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation, A. Minaburo, L. Toutain, C. Gomez, D. Barthel, JC. Zuniga</title>
        <dc:date>2020-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This document defines generic functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two SCHC entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology or a product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in other documents. Data models for the context and profiles are out of scope. </description>
