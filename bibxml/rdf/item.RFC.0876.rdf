        <title>RFC 0876: Survey of SMTP implementations, D. Smallberg</title>
        <dc:date>1983-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC is a survey of implementation status.  It does not specify    an official protocol, but rather notes the status of implementation    of aspects of a protocol.  It is expected that the status of the    hosts reported on will change.  This information must be treated as a    snapshot of the state of these implemetations. </description>
