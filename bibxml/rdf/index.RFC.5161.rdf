        <title>RFC 5161: The IMAP ENABLE Extension, A. Gulbrandsen, A. Melnikov</title>
        <dc:date>2008-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Most IMAP extensions are used by the client when it wants to and the server supports it.  However, a few extensions require the server to know whether a client supports that extension.  The ENABLE extension allows an IMAP client to say which extensions it supports.
