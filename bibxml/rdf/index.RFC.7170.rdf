        <description>This document defines the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP) version 1.  TEAP is a tunnel-based EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  Within the tunnel, TLV objects are used to convey authentication-related data between the EAP peer and the EAP server. </description>
