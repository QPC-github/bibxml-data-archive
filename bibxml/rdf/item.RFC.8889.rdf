        <title>RFC 8889: Multipoint Alternate-Marking Method for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring, G. Fioccola, M. Cociglio, A. Sapio, R. Sisto</title>
        <dc:date>2020-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be applied to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the packets of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second node. This document generalizes and expands this methodology to measure any kind of unicast flow whose packets can follow several different paths in the network -- in wider terms, a multipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason, the technique here described is called "Multipoint Alternate Marking". </description>
