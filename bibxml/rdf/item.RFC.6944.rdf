        <title>RFC 6944: Applicability Statement: DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm Implementation Status, S. Rose</title>
        <dc:date>2013-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms, but there is no record of the recommended implementation status of each algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on algorithm implementation status for DNSSEC component software.  This document lists each algorithm's status based on the current reference.  In the case that an algorithm is specified without an implementation status, this document assigns one.  This document updates RFCs 2536, 2539, 3110, 4034, 4398, 5155, 5702, and 5933. </description>
