        <title>RFC 0976: UUCP mail interchange format standard, M.R. Horton</title>
        <dc:date>1986-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the standard format for the transmission of mail    messages between computers in the UUCP Project.  It does not however,    address the format for storage of messages on one machine, nor the lower    level transport mechanisms used to get the date from one machine to the    next.  It represents a standard for conformance by hosts in the UUCP    zone. </description>
