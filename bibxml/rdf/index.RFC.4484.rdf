        <title>RFC 4484: Trait-Based Authorization Requirements for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), J. Peterson, J. Polk, D. Sicker, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2006-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document lays out a set of requirements related to trait-based authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  While some authentication mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, trait-based authorization provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant in a session.  This approach provides a richer framework for authorization, as well as allows greater privacy for users of an identity system.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
