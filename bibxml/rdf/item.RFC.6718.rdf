        <title>RFC 6718: Pseudowire Redundancy, P. Muley, M. Aissaoui, M. Bocci</title>
        <dc:date>2012-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a framework comprised of a number of scenarios and associated requirements for pseudowire (PW) redundancy. A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in single-segment PW applications or between terminating PE (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment PW applications.  In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new PW status is required to indicate the preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in the redundant set.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
