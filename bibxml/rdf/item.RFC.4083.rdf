        <title>RFC 4083: Input 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 5 Requirements on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), M. Garcia-Martin</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS).  IMS is part of Release 5 of the 3GPP specifications.  Although SIP is a protocol that fulfills most of the requirements for establishing a session in an IP network, SIP has never been evaluated against the specific 3GPP requirements for operation in a cellular network.  In this document, we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support SIP for Release 5 of the 3GPP IMS in cellular networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
