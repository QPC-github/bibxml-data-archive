        <title>RFC 7338: Requirements and Framework for Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowires over MPLS Packet Switched Networks, F. Jounay, Y. Kamite, G. Heron, M. Bocci</title>

        <description>This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for providing a point-to-multipoint pseudowire (PW) over MPLS Packet Switched Networks.  The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling, and maintenance aspects of point-to-multipoint PW operation.  They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms.  Among other potential applications, point-to-multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast Layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast Service). </description>
