        <description>RSVP signaling messages typically include policy data objects, which in turn contain policy elements.  Policy elements may describe user and/or application information, which may be used by RSVP aware network elements to apply appropriate policy decisions to a traffic flow.  This memo details the usage of policy elements that provide application information.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
