        <title>RFC 8721: Advice to the Trustees of the IETF Trust on Rights to Be Granted in IETF Documents, J. Halpern</title>
        <dc:date>2020-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Contributors grant intellectual property rights to the IETF.  The IETF Trust holds and manages those rights on behalf of the IETF.  The Trustees of the IETF Trust are responsible for that management.  This management includes granting the licenses to copy, implement, and otherwise use IETF Contributions, among them Internet-Drafts and RFCs. The Trustees of the IETF Trust accept direction from the IETF regarding the rights to be granted. This document describes the desires of the IETF regarding outbound rights to be granted in IETF Contributions. This document obsoletes RFC 5377 solely for the purpose of removing references to the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was part of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA). </description>
