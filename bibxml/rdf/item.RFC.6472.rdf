        <title>RFC 6472: Recommendation for Not Using AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP, W. Kumari, K. Sriram</title>
        <dc:date>2011-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document recommends against the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of BGP and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.  This will also simplify the design, implementation, and deployment of ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.  This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice. </description>
