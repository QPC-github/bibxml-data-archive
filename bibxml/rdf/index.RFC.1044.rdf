        <title>RFC 1044: Internet Protocol on Network System's HYPERchannel: Protocol Specification, K. Hardwick, J. Lekashman</title>
        <dc:date>1988-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo intends to provide a complete discussion of the protocols and techniques used to embed DoD standard Internet Protocol datagrams (and its associated higher level protocols) on Network Systems Corporation's HYPERchannel equipment.  This document is directed toward network planners and implementors who are already familiar with the TCP/IP protocol suite and the techniques used to carry TCP/IP traffic on common networks such as the DDN or the Ethernet.  No great familiarity with NSC products is assumed; an appendix is devoted to a review of NSC technologies and protocols. </description>
