        <title>RFC 4190: Framework for Supporting Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) in IP Telephony, K. Carlberg, I. Brown, C. Beard</title>
        <dc:date>2005-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document presents a framework for supporting authorized, emergency-related communication within the context of IP telephony. We present a series of objectives that reflect a general view of how authorized emergency service, in line with the Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), should be realized within today's IP architecture and service models.  From these objectives, we present a corresponding set of protocols and capabilities, which provide a more specific set of recommendations regarding existing IETF protocols.  Finally, we present two scenarios that act as guiding models for the objectives and functions listed in this document.  These models, coupled with an example of an existing service in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), contribute to a constrained solution space.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
