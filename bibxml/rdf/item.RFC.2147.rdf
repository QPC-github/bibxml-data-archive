        <title>RFC 2147: TCP and UDP over IPv6 Jumbograms, D. Borman</title>
        <dc:date>1997-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IPv6 supports datagrams larger than 65535 bytes long, often referred to as jumbograms, through use of the Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option.  The UDP protocol has a 16-bit length field that keeps it from being able to make use of jumbograms, and though TCP does not have a length field, both the MSS option and the Urgent field are constrained by 16-bits. This document describes some simple changes that can be made to allow TCP and UDP to make use of IPv6 jumbograms.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
