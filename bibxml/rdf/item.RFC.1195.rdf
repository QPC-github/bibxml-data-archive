        <title>RFC 1195: Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments, R.W. Callon</title>
        <dc:date>1990-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.  This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.  This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
