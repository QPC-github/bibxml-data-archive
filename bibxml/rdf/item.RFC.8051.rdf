        <title>RFC 8051: Applicability of a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE), X. Zhang, I. Minei</title>
        <dc:date>2017-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic-engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through a number of use cases.  PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents. </description>
