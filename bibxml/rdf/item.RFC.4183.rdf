        <title>RFC 4183: A Suggested Scheme for DNS Resolution of Networks and Gateways, E. Warnicke</title>
        <dc:date>2005-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document suggests a method of using DNS to determine the network that contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that network, and the address(es) of first-hop routers(s) on that network.  This method supports variable-length subnet masks, delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers per subnet.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
