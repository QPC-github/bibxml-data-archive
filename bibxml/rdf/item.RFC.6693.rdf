        <title>RFC 6693: Probabilistic Routing Protocol for Intermittently Connected Networks, A. Lindgren, A. Doria, E. Davies, S. Grasic</title>

        <description>This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a variant of the epidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that operates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimize resource usage while still attempting to achieve the \%best-case routing capabilities of epidemic routing.  It is intended for use in sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between the source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where there is a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred to as delay and disruption tolerant).  The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
