        <title>RFC 8384: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Smart Endnodes, R. Perlman, F. Hu, D. Eastlake 3rd, T. Liao</title>

        <description>This document addresses the problem of the size and freshness of the endnode learning table in edge Routing Bridges (RBridges), by allowing endnodes to volunteer for endnode learning and encapsulation/decapsulation.  Such an endnode is known as a "Smart               Endnode".  Only the attached edge RBridge can distinguish a "Smart               Endnode" from a "normal endnode".  The Smart Endnode uses the nickname of the attached edge RBridge, so this solution does not consume extra nicknames.  The solution also enables endnodes that are Fine-Grained Label (FGL) aware. </description>
