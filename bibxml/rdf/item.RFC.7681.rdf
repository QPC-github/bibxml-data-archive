        <title>RFC 7681: Email Exchange of Secondary School Transcripts, J. Davin</title>
        <dc:date>2015-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A common format simplifies exchange of secondary school academic transcripts via electronic mail.  Existing standards are applied to prevent unauthorized alteration of transcript content and to deliver transcripts directly and securely from each student to his or her chosen recipients.  By eliminating third-party intervention and surveillance, the defined protocol better protects student privacy and independence than does current practice. </description>
