        <title>RFC 0815: IP datagram reassembly algorithms, D.D. Clark</title>
        <dc:date>1982-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC describes an alternate approach of dealing with reassembly which reduces the bookkeeping problem to a minimum, and requires only one buffer for storage equal in size to the final datagram being reassembled, which can reassemble a datagram from any number of fragments arriving in any order with any possible pattern of overlap and duplication, and which is appropriate for almost any sort of operating system. </description>
