        <title>RFC 8858: Indicating Exclusive Support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Multiplexing Using the Session Description Protocol (SDP), C. Holmberg</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level attribute, 'rtcp-mux-only', that can be used by an endpoint to indicate exclusive support of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) multiplexing. The document also updates RFC 5761 by clarifying that an offerer can use a mechanism to indicate that it is not able to send and receive RTCP on separate ports. </description>
