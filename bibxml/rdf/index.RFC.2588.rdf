        <title>RFC 2588: IP Multicast and Firewalls, R. Finlayson</title>
        <dc:date>1999-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In this document, we discuss the issues surrounding the traversal of IP multicast traffic across a firewall, and describe possible ways in which a firewall can implement and control this traversal.  We also explain why some firewall mechanisms - such as SOCKS - that were designed specifically for unicast traffic, are less appropriate for multicast. This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
