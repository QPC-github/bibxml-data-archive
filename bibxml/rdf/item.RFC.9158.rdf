        <title>RFC 9158: Update to the Object Identifier Registry for the PKIX Working Group, R. Housley</title>
        <dc:date>2021-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned by the Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group in an arc that was allocated by IANA (1.3.6.1.5.5.7).  A small number of object identifiers that were assigned in RFC 4212 are omitted from RFC 7299, and this document updates RFC 7299 to correct that oversight. </description>
