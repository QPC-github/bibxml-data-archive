        <title>RFC 6426: MPLS On-Demand Connectivity Verification and Route Tracing, E. Gray, N. Bahadur, S. Boutros, R. Aggarwal</title>
        <dc:date>2011-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Label Switched Path Ping (LSP ping) is an existing and widely deployed Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  This document describes extensions to LSP ping so that LSP ping can be used for on-demand connectivity verification of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs and pseudowires.  This document also clarifies procedures to be used for processing the related OAM packets.  Further, it describes procedures for using LSP ping to perform connectivity verification and route tracing functions in MPLS-TP networks.  Finally, this document updates RFC 4379 by adding a new address type and creating an IANA registry.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
