        <title>RFC 3267: Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload Format and File Storage Format for the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) Audio Codecs, J. Sjoberg, M. Westerlund, A. Lakaniemi, Q. Xie</title>

        <description>This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) encoded speech signals.  The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.  In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.  Two separate MIME type registrations are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload format and the storage format.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
