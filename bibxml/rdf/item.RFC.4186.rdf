        <title>RFC 4186: Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Modules (EAP-SIM), H. Haverinen, J. Salowey</title>
        <dc:date>2006-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).  GSM is a second generation mobile network standard. The EAP-SIM mechanism specifies enhancements to GSM authentication and key agreement whereby multiple authentication triplets can be combined to create authentication responses and session keys of greater strength than the individual GSM triplets.  The mechanism also includes network authentication, user anonymity support, result indications, and a fast re-authentication procedure.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
