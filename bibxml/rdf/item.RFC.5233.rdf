        <title>RFC 5233: Sieve Email Filtering: Subaddress Extension, K. Murchison</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>On email systems that allow for 'subaddressing' or 'detailed addressing' (e.g., "ken+sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons against these sub-parts of addresses. This document defines an extension to the Sieve Email Filtering Language that allows users to compare against the user and detail sub-parts of an address.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
