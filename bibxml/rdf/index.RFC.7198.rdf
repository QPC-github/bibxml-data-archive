        <title>RFC 7198: Duplicating RTP Streams, A. Begen, C. Perkins</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions but can occur due to a variety of reasons including unplanned network outages.  In unicast transmissions, recovering from such an outage can be difficult depending on the outage duration, due to the potentially large number of missing packets.  In multicast transmissions, recovery is even more challenging as many receivers could be impacted by the outage.  For this challenge, one solution that does not incur unbounded delay is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate redundant streams, provided that the underlying network satisfies certain requirements.  This document explains how Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules. </description>
