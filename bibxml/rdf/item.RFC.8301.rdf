        <title>RFC 8301: Cryptographic Algorithm and Key Usage Update to DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), S. Kitterman</title>
        <dc:date>2018-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included when DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) was designed a decade ago are functionally obsolete and in need of immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements to those minimally suitable for operation with currently specified algorithms. </description>
