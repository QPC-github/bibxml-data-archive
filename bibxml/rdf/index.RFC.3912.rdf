        <title>RFC 3912: WHOIS Protocol Specification, L. Daigle</title>
        <dc:date>2004-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates the specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby obsoleting RFC 954.  The update is intended to remove the material from RFC 954 that does not have to do with the on-the-wire protocol, and is no longer applicable in today's Internet.  This document does not attempt to change or update the protocol per se, or document other uses of the protocol that have come into existence since the publication of RFC 954.
