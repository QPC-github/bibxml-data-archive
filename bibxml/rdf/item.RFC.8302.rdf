        <title>RFC 8302: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): ARP and Neighbor Discovery (ND) Optimization, Y. Li, D. Eastlake 3rd, L. Dunbar, R. Perlman, M. Umair</title>
        <dc:date>2018-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes mechanisms to optimize the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Neighbor Discovery (ND) traffic in a Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) campus.  TRILL switches maintain a cache of IP / Media Access Control (MAC) address / Data Label bindings that are learned from ARP/ND requests and responses that pass through them.  In many cases, this cache allows an edge Routing Bridge (RBridge) to avoid flooding an ARP/ND request by either responding to it directly or encapsulating it and unicasting it.  Such optimization reduces packet flooding over a TRILL campus. </description>
