        <description>This document provides examples of the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI; or SCSI over TCP) name construction and discussion of discovery of iSCSI resources (targets) by iSCSI initiators.  This document complements the iSCSI protocol document.  Flexibility is the key guiding principle behind this document.  That is, an effort has been made to satisfy the needs of both small isolated environments, as well as large environments requiring secure/scalable solutions.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
