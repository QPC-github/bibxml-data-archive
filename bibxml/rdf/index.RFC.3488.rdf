        <dc:date>2003-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Router-port Group Management Protocol (RGMP).  This protocol was developed by Cisco Systems and is used between multicast routers and switches to restrict multicast packet forwarding in switches to those routers where the packets may be needed. RGMP is designed for backbone switched networks where multiple, high speed routers are interconnected.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
