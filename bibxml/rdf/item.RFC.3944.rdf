        <dc:date>2004-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> Because SIP is an IETF standard, the contents of H.350 and H.350.4 are made available via this document to the IETF community.  This document contains the entire normative text of ITU-T Recommendations H.350 and H.350.4 in sections 4 and 5, respectively.  The remaining sections are included only in this document, not in the ITU-T version.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
