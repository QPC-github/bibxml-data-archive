        <dc:date>2003-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the IANA's allocation of a block of Diameter Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 5.  This document does not pass judgment on the usage of these command codes.  Further more, these command codes are for use for Release 5.  For future releases, these codes cannot be reused, but must be allocated according to the Diameter Base specification.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
