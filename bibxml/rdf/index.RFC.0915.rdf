        <title>RFC 0915: Network mail path service, M.A. Elvy, R. Nedved</title>
        <dc:date>1984-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposed a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The network mail    path service fills the current need of people to determine mailbox    addresses for hosts that are not part of the ARPA-Internet but can be    reached by one or more relay hosts that have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP)    mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone can use the    service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path server. </description>
