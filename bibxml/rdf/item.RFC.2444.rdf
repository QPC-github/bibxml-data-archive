        <title>RFC 2444: The One-Time-Password SASL Mechanism, C. Newman</title>
        <dc:date>1998-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>OTP provides a useful authentication mechanism for situations where there is limited client or server trust.  Currently, OTP is added to protocols in an ad-hoc fashion with heuristic parsing.  This specification defines an OTP SASL mechanism so it can be easily and formally integrated into many application protocols.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
