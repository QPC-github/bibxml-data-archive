        <title>RFC 3680: A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations, J. Rosenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2004-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package for registrations.  Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows a user agent to create, modify, and delete registrations.  Registrations can also be altered by administrators in order to enforce policy.  As a result, these registrations represent a piece of state in the network that can change dynamically.  There are many cases where a user agent would like to be notified of changes in this state.  This event package defines a mechanism by which those user agents can request and obtain such notifications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
