        <title>RFC 5885: Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for the Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), T. Nadeau, C. Pignataro</title>
        <dc:date>2010-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes Connectivity Verification (CV) Types using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV).  VCCV provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW), as well as the corresponding operations and management functions such as connectivity verification to be used over that control channel.
