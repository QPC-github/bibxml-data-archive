        <title>RFC 5886: A Set of Monitoring Tools for Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, JP. Vasseur, JL. Le Roux, Y. Ikejiri</title>
        <dc:date>2010-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In PCE-based environments, it is thus critical to monitor the state of the path computation chain for troubleshooting and performance monitoring purposes: liveness of each element (PCE) involved in the PCE chain and detection of potential resource contention states and statistics in terms of path computation times are examples of such metrics of interest.  This document specifies procedures and extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to gather such information.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
