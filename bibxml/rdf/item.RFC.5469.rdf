        <title>RFC 5469: DES and IDEA Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS), P. Eronen</title>
        <dc:date>2009-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346) include cipher suites based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) and IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) algorithms.  DES (when used in single-DES mode) and IDEA are no longer recommended for general use in TLS, and have been removed from TLS version 1.2 (RFC 5246).  This document specifies these cipher suites for completeness and discusses reasons why their use is no longer recommended.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
