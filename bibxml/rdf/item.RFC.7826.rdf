        <title>RFC 7826: Real-Time Streaming Protocol Version 2.0, H. Schulzrinne, A. Rao, R. Lanphier, M. Westerlund, M. Stiemerling</title>

        <description>RTSP is an application-layer protocol for the setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips.  This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions; provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP, and TCP; and provide a means for choosing delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550). </description>
