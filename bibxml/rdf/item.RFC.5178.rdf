        <title>RFC 5178: Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Internationalization and Domain-Based Service Names and Name Type, N. Williams, A. Melnikov</title>
        <dc:date>2008-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names, but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in addition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of domain-based names is to provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize insecure service discovery protocols.  This is achieved by providing a way to name clustered services after the "domain" which they service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of their service names.
