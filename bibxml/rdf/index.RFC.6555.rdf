        <title>RFC 6555: Happy Eyeballs: Success with Dual-Stack Hosts, D. Wing, A. Yourtchenko</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When a server's IPv4 path and protocol are working, but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and provides an algorithm.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
