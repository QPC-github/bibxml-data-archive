        <title>RFC 3903: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication, A. Niemi</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> The mechanism described in this document can be extended to support publication of any event state for which there exists an appropriate event package.  It is not intended to be a general-purpose mechanism for transport of arbitrary data, as there are better-suited mechanisms for this purpose.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
