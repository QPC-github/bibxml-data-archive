        <title>RFC 8226: Secure Telephone Identity Credentials: Certificates, J. Peterson, S. Turner</title>
        <dc:date>2018-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In order to prevent the impersonation of telephone numbers on the Internet, some kind of credential system needs to exist that cryptographically asserts authority over telephone numbers.  This document describes the use of certificates in establishing authority over telephone numbers, as a component of a broader architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in protocols like SIP. </description>
