        <title>RFC 8254: Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition, J. Klensin, J. Hakala</title>
        <dc:date>2017-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging registration and publication of information for all appropriate namespaces.  This document clarifies the status of relevant older RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and 3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN and ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions reside in registration templates. </description>
