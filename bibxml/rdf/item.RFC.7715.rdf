        <title>RFC 7715: Multipoint LDP (mLDP) Node Protection, IJ. Wijnands, K. Raza, A. Atlas, J. Tantsura, Q. Zhao</title>
        <dc:date>2016-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes procedures to support node protection for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (P2MP and MP2MP LSPs) that have been built by the Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP).  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) Label Switching Router (LSR) of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing Point-to-Point (P2P) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  The pre-established LSPs originate from the PLR LSR and terminate on the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR N. </description>
