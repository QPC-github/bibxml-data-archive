        <title>RFC 3765: NOPEER Community for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Route Scope Control, G. Huston</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the use of a scope control Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community.  This well-known advisory transitive community allows an origin AS to specify the extent to which a specific route should be externally propagated.  In particular this community, NOPEER, allows an origin AS to specify that a route with this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral peer connections.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
