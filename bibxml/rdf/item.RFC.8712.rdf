        <title>RFC 8712: The IETF-ISOC Relationship, G. Camarillo, J. Livingood</title>
        <dc:date>2020-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document summarizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in 2018. The IASA was revised under a new "IASA 2.0" structure by the IASA2 Working Group, which changed the IETF's administrative, legal, and financial structure. As a result, it also changed the relationship between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise RFC 2031. </description>
