        <title>RFC 9177: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise Transfer Options Supporting Robust Transmission, M. Boucadair, J. Shallow</title>
        <dc:date>2022-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>These options are similar to, but distinct from, the CoAP Block1 and Block2 options defined in RFC 7959. The Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 options are not intended to replace the Block1 and Block2 options but rather have the goal of supporting Non-confirmable (NON) messages for large amounts of data with fewer packet interchanges. Also, the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 options support faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission. </description>
