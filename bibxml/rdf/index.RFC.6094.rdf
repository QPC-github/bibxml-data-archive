        <title>RFC 6094: Summary of Cryptographic Authentication Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Routing Protocols, M. Bhatia, V. Manral</title>
        <dc:date>2011-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document examines the current set of available algorithms, with interoperability and effective cryptographic authentication protection being the principal considerations.  Cryptographic authentication of these routing protocols requires the availability of the same algorithms in disparate implementations.  It is desirable that newly specified algorithms should be implemented and available in routing protocol implementations because they may be promoted to requirements at some future time.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
