        <title>RFC 8170: Planning for Protocol Adoption and Subsequent Transitions, D. Thaler</title>
        <dc:date>2017-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol, we have seen a number of transitions throughout the protocol stack, such as deploying a new protocol, or updating or replacing an existing protocol.  Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan. </description>
