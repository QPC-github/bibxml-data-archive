        <title>RFC 5671: Applicability of the Path Computation Element (PCE) to Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE), S. Yasukawa, A. Farrel</title>
        <dc:date>2009-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document examines the applicability of PCE to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  It describes the motivation for using a PCE to compute these paths and examines which of the PCE architectural models are appropriate.  This memo provides  information for the Internet community. </description>
