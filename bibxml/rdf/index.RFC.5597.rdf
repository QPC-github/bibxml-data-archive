        <title>RFC 5597: Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, R. Denis-Courmont</title>
        <dc:date>2009-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  These requirements allow DCCP applications, such as streaming applications, to operate consistently, and they are very similar to the TCP requirements for NATs, which have already been published by the IETF.  Ensuring that NATs meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications using DCCP will function properly.  This  document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
