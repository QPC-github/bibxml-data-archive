        <title>RFC 3991: Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Redirect and Reset Package, B. Foster, F. Andreasen</title>
        <dc:date>2005-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) specification (RFC 3435) allows endpoints to be redirected one endpoint at a time.  This document provides extensions in the form of a new MGCP package that provides mechanisms for redirecting and resetting a group of endpoints.  It also includes the ability to more accurately redirect endpoints by allowing a list of Call Agents to be specified in a preferred order.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
