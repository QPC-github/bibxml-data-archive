        <title>RFC 4849: RADIUS Filter Rule Attribute, P. Congdon, M. Sanchez, B. Aboba</title>
        <dc:date>2007-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>While RFC 2865 defines the Filter-Id attribute, it requires that the Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired filters.  However, in situations where the server operator does not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is useful to specify filter rules explicitly.  This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS).  This attribute is based on the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and the IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
