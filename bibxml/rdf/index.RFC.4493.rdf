        <title>RFC 4493: The AES-CMAC Algorithm, JH. Song, R. Poovendran, J. Lee, T. Iwata</title>
        <dc:date>2006-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), which is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.  This memo specifies an authentication algorithm based on CMAC with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This new authentication algorithm is named AES-CMAC. The purpose of this document is to make the AES-CMAC algorithm conveniently available to the Internet Community.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
