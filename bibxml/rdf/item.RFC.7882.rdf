        <description>These use cases support S-BFD, which is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of negotiation aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session.  The benefits of S-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control and flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring. </description>
