        <title>RFC 4555: IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE), P. Eronen</title>
        <dc:date>2006-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the MOBIKE protocol, a mobility and multihoming extension to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2).  MOBIKE allows the IP addresses associated with IKEv2 and tunnel mode IPsec Security Associations to change.  A mobile Virtual Private Network (VPN) client could use MOBIKE to keep the connection with the VPN gateway active while moving from one address to another.  Similarly, a multihomed host could use MOBIKE to move the traffic to a different interface if, for instance, the one currently being used stops working.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
