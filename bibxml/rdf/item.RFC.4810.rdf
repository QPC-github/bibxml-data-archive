        <title>RFC 4810: Long-Term Archive Service Requirements, C. Wallace, U. Pordesch, R. Brandner</title>
        <dc:date>2007-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There are many scenarios in which users must be able to prove the existence of data at a specific point in time and be able to demonstrate the integrity of data since that time, even when the duration from time of existence to time of demonstration spans a large period of time.  Additionally, users must be able to verify signatures on digitally signed data many years after the generation of the signature.  This document describes a class of long-term archive services to support such scenarios and the technical requirements for interacting with such services.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
