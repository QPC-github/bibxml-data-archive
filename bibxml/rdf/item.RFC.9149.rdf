        <title>RFC 9149: TLS Ticket Requests, T. Pauly, D. Schinazi, C.A. Wood</title>
        <dc:date>2022-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption for clients without server-side, per-client state.  Servers vend an arbitrary number of session tickets to clients, at their discretion, upon connection establishment.  Clients store and use tickets when resuming future connections.  This document describes a mechanism by which clients can specify the desired number of tickets needed for future connections.  This extension aims to provide a means for servers to determine the number of tickets to generate in order to reduce ticket waste while simultaneously priming clients for future connection attempts. </description>
