        <title>RFC 8804: Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Request Routing Extensions, O. Finkelman, S. Mishra</title>
        <dc:date>2020-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document defines extensions to the CDNI Metadata Interface (MI) and the Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). These extensions are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general. </description>
