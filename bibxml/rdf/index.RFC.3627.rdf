        <title>RFC 3627: Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful, P. Savola</title>
        <dc:date>2003-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127 prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.  Under certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers. </description>
