        <description>This document clarifies and summarizes the RSVP-TE protocol exchanges with relation to the programming of cross-connects along an LSP for both unidirectional and bidirectional LSPs.  This document does not define any new procedures or protocol extensions, and defers completely to the documents that provide normative references.  The clarifications set out in this document may also be used to help interpret LSP establishment performance figures for MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;  it is published for informational purposes. </description>
