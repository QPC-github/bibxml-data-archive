        <title>RFC 8218: Multipath Extension for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2), J. Yi, B. Parrein</title>
        <dc:date>2017-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a multipath extension for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) to discover multiple disjoint paths for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs).  Considering the characteristics of MANETs, especially the dynamic network topology, using multiple paths can increase aggregated throughput and improve the reliability by avoiding single route failures.  The interoperability with OLSRv2 is retained. </description>
