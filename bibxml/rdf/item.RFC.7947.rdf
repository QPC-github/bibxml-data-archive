        <description>This document outlines a specification for multilateral interconnections at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).  Multilateral interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information among three or more External BGP (EBGP) speakers using a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are typically used on shared access media networks, such as IXPs, to facilitate simplified interconnection among multiple Internet routers. </description>
