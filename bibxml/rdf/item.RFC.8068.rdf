        <description>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications environments, such as call centers and financial trading organizations.  In some of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer-protection reasons. The recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording device.  This document lists call flows with metadata snapshots sent from a Session Recording Client (SRC) to a Session Recording Server (SRS). </description>
