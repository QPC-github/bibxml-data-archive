        <title>RFC 8573: Message Authentication Code for the Network Time Protocol, A. Malhotra, S. Goldberg</title>
        <dc:date>2019-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Network Time Protocol (NTP), as described in RFC 5905, states that NTP packets should be authenticated by appending NTP data to a 128-bit key and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag. This document deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is considered too weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC as described in RFC 4493 as a replacement. </description>
