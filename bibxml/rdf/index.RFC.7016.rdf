        <title>RFC 7016: Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol, M. Thornburgh</title>
        <dc:date>2013-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP), an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to securely transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data messages, as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features that make it effective for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-server communications, even when Network Address Translators (NATs) are used. </description>
