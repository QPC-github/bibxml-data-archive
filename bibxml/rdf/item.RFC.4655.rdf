        <title>RFC 4655: A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, A. Farrel, J.-P. Vasseur, J. Ash</title>
        <dc:date>2006-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.  This document does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components, but rather it describes a set of building blocks for the PCE architecture from which solutions may be constructed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
