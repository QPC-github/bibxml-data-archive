        <title>RFC 8390: RSVP-TE Path Diversity Using Exclude Route, Z. Ali, G. Swallow, F. Zhang, D. Beller</title>

        <description>For the protection use case, LSPs are typically created at a slow rate and exist for a long time so that it is reasonable to assume that a given (reference) path currently existing (with a well-known identifier) will continue to exist and can be used as a reference when creating the new diverse path.  Re-routing of the existing (reference) LSP, before the new path is established, is not considered. </description>
