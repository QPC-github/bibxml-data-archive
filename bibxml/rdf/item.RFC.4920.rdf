        <title>RFC 4920: Crankback Signaling Extensions for MPLS and GMPLS RSVP-TE, A. Farrel, A. Satyanarayana, A. Iwata, N. Fujita, G. Ash</title>
        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies crankback signaling extensions for use in MPLS signaling using RSVP-TE as defined in "RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels", RFC 3209, and GMPLS signaling as defined in "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Functional Description", RFC 3473.  These extensions mean that the LSP setup request can be retried on an alternate path that detours around blocked links or nodes.  This offers significant improvements in the successful setup and recovery ratios for LSPs, especially in situations where a large number of setup requests are triggered at the same time.
