        <title>RFC 7156: Diameter Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6 Localized Routing, G. Zorn, Q. Wu, J. Korhonen</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing.  The term "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA.  In a Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployment, it may be desirable to control the establishment of localized routing sessions between two MAGs in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain by requiring that the session be authorized.  This document specifies how to accomplish this using the Diameter protocol. </description>
