        <title>RFC 6640: IETF Meeting Attendees' Frequently Asked (Travel) Questions, W. George</title>
        <dc:date>2012-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document attempts to provide a list of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) posed by IETF meeting attendees regarding travel logistics and local information.  It is intended to assist those who are willing to provide local information, so that if they wish to pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions either in the IETF wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete list of ideas to draw from.  It is not meant as a list of required information that the host or Secretariat needs to provide; it merely serves as a guideline.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
