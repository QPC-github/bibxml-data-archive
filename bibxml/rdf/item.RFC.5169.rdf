        <title>RFC 5169: Handover Key Management and Re-Authentication Problem Statement, T. Clancy, M. Nakhjiri, V. Narayanan, L. Dondeti</title>
        <dc:date>2008-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication problem statement.  The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing an EAP method.  This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless environments.  This document details the problem and defines design goals for a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.  This memo  provides information for the Internet community. </description>
