        <title>RFC 5031: A Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Emergency and Other Well-Known Services, H. Schulzrinne</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The content of many communication services depends on the context, such as the user's location.  We describe a 'service' URN that allows well-known context-dependent services that can be resolved in a distributed manner to be identified.  Examples include emergency services, directory assistance, and call-before-you-dig hot lines.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
