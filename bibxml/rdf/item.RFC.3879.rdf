        <title>RFC 3879: Deprecating Site Local Addresses, C. Huitema, B. Carpenter</title>
        <dc:date>2004-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the issues surrounding the use of IPv6 site-local unicast addresses in their original form, and formally deprecates them.  This deprecation does not prevent their continued use until a replacement has been standardized and implemented.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
