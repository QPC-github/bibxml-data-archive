        <description>This document describes methodologies that have been designed to improve and facilitate IETF document flow processing.  It specifies a set of procedures under which a working group chair or secretary serves as the primary Document Shepherd for a document that has been submitted to the IESG for publication.  Before this, the Area Director responsible for the working group has traditionally filled the shepherding role.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
