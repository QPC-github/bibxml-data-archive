        <title>RFC 5388: Information Model and XML Data Model for Traceroute Measurements, S. Niccolini, S. Tartarelli, J. Quittek, T. Dietz, M. Swany</title>
        <dc:date>2008-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a standard way to store the configuration and the results of traceroute measurements.  This document first describes the terminology used in this document and the traceroute tool itself; afterwards, the common information model is defined, dividing the information elements into two semantically separated groups (configuration elements and results elements).  Moreover, an additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and results elements by means of a common unique identifier.  On the basis of the information model, a data model based on XML is defined to store the results of traceroute measurements.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
