        <title>RFC 1893: Enhanced Mail System Status Codes, G. Vaudreuil</title>
        <dc:date>1996-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There currently is not a standard mechanism for the reporting of mail system errors except for the limited set offered by SMTP and the system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages.  There is a pressing need for a rich machine readable status code for use in delivery status notifications [DSN].  This document proposes a new set of status codes for this purpose.
