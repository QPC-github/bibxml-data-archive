        <title>RFC 7201: Options for Securing RTP Sessions, M. Westerlund, C. Perkins</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality, integrity, and source authentication of RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets suitable for the various environments.  The range of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides an overview of a number of security solutions for RTP and gives guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security mechanism. </description>
