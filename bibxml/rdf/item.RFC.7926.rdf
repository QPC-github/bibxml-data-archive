        <title>RFC 7926: Problem Statement and Architecture for Information Exchange between Interconnected Traffic-Engineered Networks, A. Farrel, J. Drake, N. Bitar, G. Swallow, D. Ceccarelli, X. Zhang</title>

        <description>This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement.  For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability. </description>
