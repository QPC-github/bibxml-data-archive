        <title>RFC 4236: HTTP Adaptation with Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES), A. Rousskov, M. Stecher</title>
        <dc:date>2005-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework documents several application-agnostic mechanisms such as OPES tracing, OPES bypass, and OPES callout protocol.  This document extends those generic mechanisms for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) adaptation. Together, application-agnostic OPES documents and this HTTP profile constitute a complete specification for HTTP adaptation with OPES.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
