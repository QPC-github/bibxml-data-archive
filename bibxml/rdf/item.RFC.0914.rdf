        <title>RFC 0914: Thinwire protocol for connecting personal computers to the Internet, D.J. Farber, G. Delp, T.M. Conte</title>
        <dc:date>1984-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the    ARPA-Internet of low speed network interconnection with personal    computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed    solutions in this document are intended as standards for the    ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge    as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually to    the adoption of standards. </description>
