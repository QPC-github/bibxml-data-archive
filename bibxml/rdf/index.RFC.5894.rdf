        <title>RFC 5894: Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA): Background, Explanation, and Rationale, J. Klensin</title>
        <dc:date>2010-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Several years have passed since the original protocol for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) was completed and deployed. During that time, a number of issues have arisen, including the need to update the system to deal with newer versions of Unicode.  Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols and the tables on which they depend.  This document provides an overview of a revised system and provides explanatory material for its components. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
