        <title>RFC 1495: Mapping between X.400 and RFC-822 Message Bodies, H. Alvestrand, S. Kille, R. Miles, M. Rose, S. Thompson</title>
        <dc:date>1993-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Since the introduction of X.400(84), there has been work ongoing for defining mappings between MHS and RFC-822.  The most recent work in this area is RFC-1327 [3], which focuses primarily on translation of envelope and headers.  This document is complimentary to RFC-1327 as it focuses on translation of the message body.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
