        <title>RFC 4192: Procedures for Renumbering an IPv6 Network without a Flag Day, F. Baker, E. Lear, R. Droms</title>
        <dc:date>2005-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a procedure that can be used to renumber a network from one prefix to another.  It uses IPv6's intrinsic ability to assign multiple addresses to a network interface to provide continuity of network service through a "make-before-break" transition, as well as addresses naming and configuration management issues.  It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and time required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the new prefix.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
