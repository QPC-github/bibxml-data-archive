        <title>RFC 1031: MILNET name domain transition, W.D. Lazear</title>
        <dc:date>1987-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC consolidates information necessary for the implementation of domain style names throughout the DDN/MILNET Internet community.  The introduction of domain style names will impact all hosts in the DDN/MILNET Internet.  This RFC is designed as an aid to implementors and administrators by providing: 1) an overview of the transition process from host tables to domains, 2) a timetable for the transition, and 3) references to documentation and software relating to the domain system. </description>
