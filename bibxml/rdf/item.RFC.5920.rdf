        <title>RFC 5920: Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks, L. Fang</title>
        <dc:date>2010-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Networks.  This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS and GMPLS.  It describes the security threats, the related defensive techniques, and the mechanisms for detection and reporting.  This document emphasizes RSVP-TE and LDP security considerations, as well as inter-AS and inter-provider security considerations for building and maintaining MPLS and GMPLS networks across different domains or different Service Providers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
