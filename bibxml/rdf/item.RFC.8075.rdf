        <title>RFC 8075: Guidelines for Mapping Implementations: HTTP to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), A. Castellani, S. Loreto, A. Rahman, T. Fossati, E. Dijk</title>

        <description>This document provides reference information for implementing a cross-protocol network proxy that performs translation from the HTTP protocol to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  This will enable an HTTP client to access resources on a CoAP server through the proxy.  This document describes how an HTTP request is mapped to a CoAP request and how a CoAP response is mapped back to an HTTP response.  This includes guidelines for status code, URI, and media type mappings, as well as additional interworking advice. </description>
