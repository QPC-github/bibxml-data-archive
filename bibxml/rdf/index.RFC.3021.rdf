        <title>RFC 3021: Using 31-Bit Prefixes on IPv4 Point-to-Point Links, A. Retana, R. White, V. Fuller, D. McPherson</title>

        <description>With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on the Internet, it makes sense to consider where relatively minor changes can be made to fielded practice to improve numbering efficiency.  One such change, proposed by this document, is to halve the amount of address space assigned to point-to-point links (common throughout the Internet infrastructure) by allowing the use of 31-bit subnet masks in a very limited way.
