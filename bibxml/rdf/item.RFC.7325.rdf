        <description>This document provides guidelines for implementers regarding MPLS    forwarding and a basis for evaluations of forwarding implementations.    Guidelines cover many aspects of MPLS forwarding.  Topics are    highlighted where implementers might otherwise overlook practical    requirements which are unstated or under emphasized or are optional    for conformance to RFCs but are often considered mandatory by    providers. </description>
