        <title>RFC 1037: NFILE - a file access protocol, B. Greenberg, S. Keene</title>
        <dc:date>1987-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document includes a specification of the NFILE file access protocol and its underlying levels of protocol, the Token List Transport Layer and Byte Stream with Mark.  The goal of this specification is to promote discussion of the ideas described here, and to encourage designers of future file protocols to take advantage of these ideas.  A secondary goal is to make the specification available to sites that might benefit from implementing NFILE. </description>
