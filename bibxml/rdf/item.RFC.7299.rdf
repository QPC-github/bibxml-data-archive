        <title>RFC 7299: Object Identifier Registry for the PKIX Working Group, R. Housley</title>
        <dc:date>2014-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use by that working group.  This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that arc, returns control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc. </description>
