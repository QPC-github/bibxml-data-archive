        <title>RFC 7832: Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) Use Cases, R. Smith</title>
        <dc:date>2016-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Federated identity is typically associated with web-based services at present, but there is growing interest in its application in non-web-based contexts.  The goal of this memo is to document a selection of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies based on the Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) architecture and specifications. </description>
