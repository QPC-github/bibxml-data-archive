        <title>RFC 7619: The NULL Authentication Method in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2), V. Smyslov, P. Wouters</title>
        <dc:date>2015-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the NULL Authentication method and the ID_NULL Identification Payload ID Type for Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  This allows two IKE peers to establish single-side authenticated or mutual unauthenticated IKE sessions for those use cases where a peer is unwilling or unable to authenticate or identify itself.  This ensures IKEv2 can be used for Opportunistic Security (also known as Opportunistic Encryption) to defend against Pervasive Monitoring attacks without the need to sacrifice anonymity. </description>
