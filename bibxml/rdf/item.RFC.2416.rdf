        <title>RFC 2416: When TCP Starts Up With Four Packets Into Only Three Buffers, T. Shepard, C. Partridge</title>
        <dc:date>1998-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo is to document a simple experiment.  The experiment showed that in the case of a TCP receiver behind a 9600 bps modem link at the edge of a fast Internet where there are only 3 buffers before the modem (and the fourth packet of a four-packet start will surely be dropped), no significant degradation in performance is experienced by a TCP sending with a four-packet start when compared with a normal slow start (which starts with just one packet).  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
