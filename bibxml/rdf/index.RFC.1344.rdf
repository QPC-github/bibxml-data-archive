        <title>RFC 1344: Implications of MIME for Internet Mail Gateways, N. Borenstein</title>
        <dc:date>1992-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>While MIME was carefully designed so that it does not require any changes to Internet electronic message transport facilities, there are several ways in which message transport systems may want to take advantage of MIME.  These opportunities are the subject of this memo. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
