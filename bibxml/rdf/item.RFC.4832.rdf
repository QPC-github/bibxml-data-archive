        <title>RFC 4832: Security Threats to Network-Based Localized Mobility Management (NETLMM), C. Vogt, J. Kempf</title>
        <dc:date>2007-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses security threats to network-based localized mobility management.  Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between a localized mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface between a mobile access gateway and a mobile node.  Threats to the former interface impact the localized mobility management protocol itself.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
