        <title>RFC 4169: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2, V. Torvinen, J. Arkko, M. Naslund</title>
        <dc:date>2005-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>HTTP Digest, as specified in RFC 2617, is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if the client fails to authenticate the server in TLS, or if the same passwords are used for authentication in some other context without TLS.  This is a general problem that exists not just with HTTP Digest, but also with other IETF protocols that use tunneled authentication.  This document specifies version 2 of the HTTP Digest AKA algorithm (RFC 3310).  This algorithm can be implemented in a way that it is resistant to the man-in-the-middle attack.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
