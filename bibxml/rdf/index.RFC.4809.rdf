        <description>This informational document describes and identifies the requirements for transactions to handle Public Key Certificate (PKC) lifecycle transactions between Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Systems using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) (versions 1 and 2) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Systems.  These requirements are designed to meet the needs of enterprise-scale IPsec VPN deployments.  It is intended that a standards track profile of a management protocol will be created to address many of these requirements.
