        <title>RFC 5296: EAP Extensions for EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP), V. Narayanan, L. Dondeti</title>
        <dc:date>2008-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting multiple types of authentication methods.  In systems where EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to not repeat the entire EAP exchange with another authenticator.  This document specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator.  The re-authentication server may be in the home network or in the local network to which the peer is connecting.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
