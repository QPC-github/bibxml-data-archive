        <title>RFC 5714: IP Fast Reroute Framework, M. Shand, S. Bryant</title>
        <dc:date>2010-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast- reroute mechanisms that provide protection against link or router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths.  Unlike MPLS fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes. </description>
