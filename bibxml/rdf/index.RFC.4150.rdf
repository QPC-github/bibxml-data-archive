        <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects used for monitoring selectable performance metrics and statistics derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application level transactions. The metrics can be defined through reference to existing IETF, ITU, and other standards organizations' documents.  The monitoring covers both passive and active traffic generation sources.
