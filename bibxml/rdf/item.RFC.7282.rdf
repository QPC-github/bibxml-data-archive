        <title>RFC 7282: On Consensus and Humming in the IETF, P. Resnick</title>
        <dc:date>2014-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Note: This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational.  It does not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP.  It is simply a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least rough) consensus. </description>
