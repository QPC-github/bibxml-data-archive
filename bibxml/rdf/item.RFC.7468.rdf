        <title>RFC 7468: Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures, S. Josefsson, S. Leonard</title>
        <dc:date>2015-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes and discusses the textual encodings of the Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The textual encodings are well-known, are implemented by several applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.  This document articulates the de facto rules by which existing implementations operate and defines them so that future implementations can interoperate. </description>
