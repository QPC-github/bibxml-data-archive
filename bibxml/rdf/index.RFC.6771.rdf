        <title>RFC 6771: Considerations for Having a Successful "Bar BOF" Side Meeting, L. Eggert, G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently discuss and develop ideas for new IETF work.  It encourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding them in much less formal settings and to also consider alternative means to develop their ideas.  This document also recommends that the community abandon the term "bar BOF" and instead use other terms such as "side meeting", in order to stress the unofficial nature of these get-togethers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
