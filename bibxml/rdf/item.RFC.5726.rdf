        <title>RFC 5726: Mobile IPv6 Location Privacy Solutions, Y. Qiu, F. Zhao, R. Koodli</title>

        <description>Mobile IPv6 (RFC 3775) enables a mobile node to remain reachable while it roams on the Internet.  However, the location and movement of the mobile node can be revealed by the IP addresses used in signaling or data packets.  In this document, we consider the Mobile IPv6 location privacy problem described in RFC 4882, and propose efficient and secure techniques to protect location privacy of the mobile node.  This document is a product of the IP Mobility Optimizations (MobOpts) Research Group.  This document defines  an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
