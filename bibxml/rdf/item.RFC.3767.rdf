        <title>RFC 3767: Securely Available Credentials Protocol, S. Farrell</title>
        <dc:date>2004-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS #15 structures) from a credential server, using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific configuration.  The protocol's payloads are described in XML.  This memo also specifies a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol.  Security requirements are  met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5 (through BEEP).  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
