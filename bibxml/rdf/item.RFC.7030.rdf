        <description>This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport.  This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates.  It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA. </description>
