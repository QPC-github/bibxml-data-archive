        <title>RFC 6916: Algorithm Agility Procedure for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), R. Gagliano, S. Kent, S. Turner</title>
        <dc:date>2013-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RPs) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set.  The process is expected to be completed over a timescale of several years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.  The transition procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent migrates before children). </description>
