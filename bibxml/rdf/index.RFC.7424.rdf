        <title>RFC 7424: Mechanisms for Optimizing Link Aggregation Group (LAG) and Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) Component Link Utilization in Networks, R. Krishnan, L. Yong, A. Ghanwani, N. So, B. Khasnabish</title>

        <description>Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially due to bandwidth-hungry applications such as rich media applications and inter-data-center communications.  In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use link aggregation groups and equal-cost multipaths as techniques for bandwidth scaling.  This document explores some of the mechanisms useful for achieving this. </description>
