        <title>RFC 3543: Registration Revocation in Mobile IPv4, S. Glass, M. Chandra</title>
        <dc:date>2003-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Mobile IPv4 Registration Revocation mechanism whereby a mobility agent involved in providing Mobile IP services to a mobile node can notify the other mobility agent providing Mobile IP services to the same mobile node of the termination of this registration.  The mechanism is also usable by a home agent to notify a co-located mobile node of the termination of its binding as well. Moreover, the mechanism provides for this notification to be acknowledged.  A signaling mechanism already defined by the Mobile IPv4 protocol is leveraged as a way to inform a mobile node of the revocation of its binding.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
