        <title>RFC 4036: Management Information Base for Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) Cable Modem Termination Systems for Subscriber Management, W. Sawyer</title>
        <dc:date>2005-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based management of Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems.  These managed objects facilitate protection of the cable network from misuse by subscribers.  The Differentiated Services MIB (RFC 3289) provides the filtering functions needed here, making use of classification items defined in this specification.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
