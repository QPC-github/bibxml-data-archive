        <description>There is a need to monitor end-devices such as IP phones, pagers, Instant Messaging clients, mobile phones, and various other handheld computing devices.  This memo extends the remote network monitoring (RMON) family of specifications to allow real-time quality-of-service (QoS) monitoring of various applications that run on these devices and allows this information to be integrated with the RMON family using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  This memo defines the framework, architecture, relevant metrics, and transport requirements for real-time QoS monitoring of applications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
