        <title>RFC 7038: Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks, R. Ogier</title>
        <dc:date>2013-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR (MANET Designated Router) in a single-hop broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop broadcast networks. </description>
