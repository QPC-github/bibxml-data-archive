        <title>RFC 4781: Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP with MPLS, Y. Rekhter, R. Aggarwal</title>
        <dc:date>2007-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The mechanism described in this document is agnostic with respect to the types of the addresses carried in the BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) field.  As such, it works in conjunction with any of the address families that could be carried in BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc.).  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
