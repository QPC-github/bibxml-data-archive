        <title>RFC 4981: Survey of Research towards Robust Peer-to-Peer Networks: Search Methods, J. Risson, T. Moors</title>
        <dc:date>2007-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>P2P search methods are first couched within an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs, and skip graphs.  Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval and data management are explored.  Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multi-attribute, join, and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed.  Insofar as they are available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted throughout.  However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature.  Recommendations are given for future research.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
