        <title>RFC 8227: MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) Mechanism for Ring Topology, W. Cheng, L. Wang, H. Li, H. van Helvoort, J. Dong</title>

        <description>This document describes requirements, architecture, and solutions for MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) in a ring topology for point- to-point (P2P) services.  The MSRP mechanism is described to meet the ring protection requirements as described in RFC 5654.  This document defines the Ring Protection Switching (RPS) protocol that is used to coordinate the protection behavior of the nodes on an MPLS ring. </description>
