        <title>RFC 6069: Making TCP More Robust to Long Connectivity Disruptions (TCP-LCD), A. Zimmermann, A. Hannemann</title>
        <dc:date>2010-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document proposes an algorithm to make TCP more robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD).  It describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions.  Moreover, a reversion strategy of the retransmission timer is specified that enables a more prompt detection of whether or not the connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been restored.  TCP-LCD is a TCP sender- only modification that effectively improves TCP performance in the case of connectivity disruptions.  This document defines an Experimental  Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
