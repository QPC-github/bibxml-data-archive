        <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow configuring middleboxes, such as firewalls and network address translators, in order to enable communication across these devices.  The definitions of managed objects in this documents follow closely the MIDCOM semantics defined in RFC 5189.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
