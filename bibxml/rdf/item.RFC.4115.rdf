        <title>RFC 4115: A Differentiated Service Two-Rate, Three-Color Marker with Efficient Handling of in-Profile Traffic, O. Aboul-Magd, S. Rabie</title>
        <dc:date>2005-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a two-rate, three-color marker that has been in use for data services including Frame Relay services.  This marker can be used for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2 VPN services.  The marker defined here is different from previously defined markers in the handling of the in-profile traffic. Furthermore, this marker doesn't impose peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
