        <title>RFC 6028: Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Multi-Hop Routing Extension, G. Camarillo, A. Keranen</title>
        <dc:date>2010-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies two extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to implement multi-hop routing.  The first extension allows implementing source routing in HIP.  That is, a node sending a HIP packet can define a set of nodes that the HIP packet should traverse.  The second extension allows a HIP packet to carry and record the list of nodes that forwarded it.   This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
