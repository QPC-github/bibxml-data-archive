        <title>RFC 6816: Simple Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase Forward Error Correction (FEC) Scheme for FECFRAME, V. Roca, M. Cunche, J. Lacan</title>
        <dc:date>2012-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a fully specified simple Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme for Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME.  These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases, and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum. </description>
