        <title>RFC 5139: Revised Civic Location Format for Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO), M. Thomson, J. Winterbottom</title>
        <dc:date>2008-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic location.  This format is designed for use with Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the civic location format in RFC 4119.  The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity schemes.  The format also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where appropriate.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
