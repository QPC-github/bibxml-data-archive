        <title>RFC 8784: Mixing Preshared Keys in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-quantum Security, S. Fluhrer, P. Kampanakis, D. McGrew, V. Smyslov</title>

        <description>The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to cryptographic algorithms deployed widely today.  The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available.  It is anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near term.  To address this problem before then, this document describes an extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by using preshared keys. </description>
