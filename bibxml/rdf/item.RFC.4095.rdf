        <title>RFC 4095: Attaching Meaning to Solicitation Class Keywords, C. Malamud</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies an application based on the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) described in RFC 3401 and related documents. An algorithm is specified to associate a solicitation class keyword with a URI which contains further information about the meaning and usage of that solicitation class keyword.  For example, the registrant of the "example.org" domain could use this mechanism to create a URI which contains detailed information about the "org.example.adv" solicitation class keyword.
