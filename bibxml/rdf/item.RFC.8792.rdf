        <title>RFC 8792: Handling Long Lines in Content of Internet-Drafts and RFCs, K. Watsen, E. Auerswald, A. Farrel, Q. Wu</title>

        <description>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content. </description>
