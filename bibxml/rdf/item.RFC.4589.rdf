        <dc:date>2006-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document creates a registry for describing the types of places a human or end system might be found.  The registry is then referenced by other protocols that need a common set of location terms as protocol constants.  Examples of location terms defined in this document include aircraft, office, and train station.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
