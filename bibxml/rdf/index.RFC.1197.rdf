        <title>RFC 1197: Using ODA for translating multimedia information, M. Sherman</title>
        <dc:date>1990-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this RFC is to inform implementors of multimedia systems about our experiences using ISO 8613: Office Document Architecture (ODA).  Because ODA is being proposed as an encoding format for use in multimedia mail and file exchange, implementors wishing to use ODA in an open systems environment may profit from our experiences.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify any standard. </description>
