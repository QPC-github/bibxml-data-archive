        <title>RFC 5059: Bootstrap Router (BSR) Mechanism for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM), N. Bhaskar, A. Gall, J. Lingard, S. Venaas</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the class of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) family that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to discover the sources that send to a particular multicast group.  BSR is one way that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to function.  The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router failure.
