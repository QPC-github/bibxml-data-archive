        <title>RFC 6839: Additional Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes, T. Hansen, A. Melnikov</title>
        <dc:date>2013-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned meta- information distinguished by a structured syntax to permit noting an attribute of the media as a suffix to the name.  This document defines several structured syntax suffixes for use with media type registrations.  In particular, it defines and registers the "+json", "+ber", "+der", "+fastinfoset", "+wbxml" and "+zip" structured syntax suffixes, and provides a media type structured syntax suffix registration form for the "+xml" structured syntax suffix.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
