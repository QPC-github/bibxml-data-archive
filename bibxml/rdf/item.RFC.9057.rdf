        <dc:date>2021-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The current specification augments the altered use of the From: field by specifying the Author: field, which ensures identification of the original author of the message and is not subject to modification by Mediators. This document is published as an Experimental RFC to assess community interest, functional efficacy, and technical adequacy. </description>
