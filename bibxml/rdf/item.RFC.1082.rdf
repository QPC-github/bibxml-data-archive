        <title>RFC 1082: Post Office Protocol: Version 3: Extended service offerings, M.T. Rose</title>
        <dc:date>1988-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access mail from a discussion group server, as an extension to an earlier memo which dealt with dynamically accessing mail from a mailbox server using the Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3).  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  All of the extensions described in this memo to the POP3 are OPTIONAL. </description>
