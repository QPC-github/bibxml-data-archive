        <title>RFC 5572: IPv6 Tunnel Broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP), M. Blanchet, F. Parent</title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A tunnel broker with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) enables the establishment of tunnels of various inner protocols, such as IPv6 or IPv4, inside various outer protocols packets, such as IPv4, IPv6, or UDP over IPv4 for IPv4 NAT traversal.  The control protocol (TSP) is used by the tunnel client to negotiate the tunnel with the broker.  A mobile node implementing TSP can be connected to both IPv4 and IPv6 networks whether it is on IPv4 only, IPv4 behind a NAT, or on IPv6 only.  A tunnel broker may terminate the tunnels on remote tunnel servers or on itself.  This document describes the TSP within the model of the tunnel broker model.  This document defines an Experimental  Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
