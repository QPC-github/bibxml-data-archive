        <title>RFC 8873: Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) over Data Channels, JM. Recio, C. Holmberg</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies how a Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) data channel can be used as a transport mechanism for the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) and how the Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer mechanism can be used to negotiate such a data channel, referred to as an MSRP data channel. Two network configurations are supported: the connection of two MSRP data channel endpoints; and a gateway configuration, which connects an MSRP data channel endpoint with an MSRP endpoint that uses either TCP or TLS.  This document updates RFC 4975. </description>
