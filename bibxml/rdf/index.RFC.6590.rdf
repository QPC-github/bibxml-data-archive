        <title>RFC 6590: Redaction of Potentially Sensitive Data from Mail Abuse Reports, J. Falk, M. Kucherawy</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Email messages often contain information that might be considered private or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms.  When such a message becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared with other entities, the report generator may wish to redact or elide the sensitive portions of the message.  This memo suggests one method for doing so effectively.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
