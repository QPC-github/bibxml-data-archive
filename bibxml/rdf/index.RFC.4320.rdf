        <title>RFC 4320: Actions Addressing Identified Issues with the Session Initiation Protocol's (SIP) Non-INVITE Transaction, R. Sparks</title>
        <dc:date>2006-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes modifications to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the SIP non-INVITE transaction.  These modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition inherent in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic.  They also improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding.  These changes update behavior defined in RFC 3261.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
