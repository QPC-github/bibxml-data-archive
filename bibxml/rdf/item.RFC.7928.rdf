        <title>RFC 7928: Characterization Guidelines for Active Queue Management (AQM), N. Kuhn, P. Natarajan, N. Khademi, D. Ros</title>
        <dc:date>2016-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew of performance issues.  These performance issues can be addressed by some form of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in combination with a packet-scheduling scheme such as fair queuing. This document describes various criteria for performing characterizations of AQM schemes that can be used in lab testing during development, prior to deployment. </description>
