        <title>RFC 9060: Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) Certificate Delegation, J. Peterson</title>
        <dc:date>2021-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) certificate profile provides a way to attest authority over telephone numbers and related identifiers for the purpose of preventing telephone number spoofing. This specification details how that authority can be delegated from a parent certificate to a subordinate certificate. This supports a number of use cases, including those where service providers grant credentials to enterprises or other customers capable of signing calls with STIR. </description>
