        <title>RFC 5826: Home Automation Routing Requirements in Low-Power and Lossy Networks, A. Brandt, J. Buron, G. Porcu</title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document presents requirements specific to home control and automation applications for Routing Over Low power and Lossy (ROLL) networks.  In the near future, many homes will contain high numbers of wireless devices for a wide set of purposes.  Examples include actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating valve), sensors (wall switch, water leak, blood pressure), and advanced controllers (radio-frequency-based AV remote control, central server for light and heat control).  Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, routing is often required.  The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home-control and automation environment.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
