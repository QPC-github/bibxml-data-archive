        <title>RFC 9125: Gateway Auto-Discovery and Route Advertisement for Site Interconnection Using Segment Routing, A. Farrel, J. Drake, E. Rosen, K. Patel, L. Jalil</title>
        <dc:date>2021-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to allow data center gateway routers to advertise routes to the prefixes reachable in the site, including advertising them on behalf of other gateways at the same site.  This allows segment routing to be used to identify multiple paths across the Internet or backbone network between different gateways.  The paths can be selected for load-balancing, resilience, and quality purposes. </description>
