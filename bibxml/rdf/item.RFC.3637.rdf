        <title>RFC 3637: Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet WAN Interface Sublayer, C.M. Heard</title>
        <dc:date>2003-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing the Ethernet Wide Area Network (WAN) Interface Sublayer (WIS).  The MIB module defined in this memo is an extension of the Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Interface MIB and is implemented in conjunction with it and with the Ethernet-like Interface MIB, the 802.3 Medium Attachment Unit MIB, the Interfaces Group MIB, and the Inverted Stack Table MIB. </description>
