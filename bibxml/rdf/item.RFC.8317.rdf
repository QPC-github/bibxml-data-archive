        <title>RFC 8317: Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridging EVPN (PBB-EVPN), A. Sajassi, S. Salam, J. Drake, J. Uttaro, S. Boutros, J. Rabadan</title>

        <description>The MEF Forum (MEF) has defined a rooted-multipoint Ethernet service known as Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree).  A solution framework for supporting this service in MPLS networks is described in RFC 7387, "A Framework                                for Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Service over a Multiprotocol Label                                       Switching (MPLS) Network".  This document discusses how those functional requirements can be met with a solution based on RFC 7432, "BGP MPLS Based Ethernet VPN (EVPN)", with some extensions and a description of how such a solution can offer a more efficient implementation of these functions than that of RFC 7796, "Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Support in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)". This document makes use of the most significant bit of the Tunnel Type field (in the P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute) governed by the IANA registry created by RFC 7385; hence, it updates RFC 7385 accordingly. </description>
