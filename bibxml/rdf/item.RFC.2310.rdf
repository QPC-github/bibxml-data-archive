        <title>RFC 2310: The Safe Response Header Field, K. Holtman</title>
        <dc:date>1998-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a HTTP response header field called Safe, which can be used to indicate that repeating a HTTP request is safe.  Such an indication will allow user agents to handle retries of some safe requests, in particular safe POST requests, in a more user-friendly way. </description>
