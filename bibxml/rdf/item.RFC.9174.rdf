        <title>RFC 9174: Delay-Tolerant Networking TCP Convergence-Layer Protocol Version 4, B. Sipos, M. Demmer, J. Ott, S. Perreault</title>
        <dc:date>2022-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a TCP convergence layer (TCPCL) for Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN). This version of the TCPCL protocol resolves implementation issues in the earlier TCPCL version 3 as defined in RFC 7242 and provides updates to the Bundle Protocol (BP) contents, encodings, and convergence-layer requirements in BP version 7 (BPv7). Specifically, TCPCLv4 uses BPv7 bundles encoded by the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) as its service data unit being transported and provides a reliable transport of such bundles. This TCPCL version also includes security and extensibility mechanisms. </description>
