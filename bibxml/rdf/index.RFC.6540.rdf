        <title>RFC 6540: IPv6 Support Required for All IP-Capable Nodes, W. George, C. Donley, C. Liljenstolpe, L. Howard</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Given the global lack of available IPv4 space, and limitations in IPv4 extension and transition technologies, this document advises that IPv6 support is no longer considered optional.  It also cautions that there are places in existing IETF documents where the term "IP" is used in a way that could be misunderstood by implementers as the term "IP" becomes a generic that can mean IPv4 + IPv6, IPv6-only, or IPv4-only, depending on context and application.  This memo documents  an Internet Best Current Practice. </description>
