        <title>RFC 4633: Experiment in Long-Term Suspensions From Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Mailing Lists, S. Hartman</title>
        <dc:date>2006-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Discussion in the community has begun to question whether RFC 3683 and RFC 3934 provide the appropriate flexibility for managing Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) mailing lists.  This document is an RFC 3933 experiment designed to allow the community to experiment with a broader set of tools for mailing list management while trying to determine what the long-term guidelines should be.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
