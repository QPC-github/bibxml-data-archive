        <title>RFC 4215: Analysis on IPv6 Transition in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Networks, J. Wiljakka</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios.  In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
