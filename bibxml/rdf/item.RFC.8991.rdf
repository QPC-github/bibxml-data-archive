        <title>RFC 8991: GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol Application Program Interface (GRASP API), B. Carpenter, B. Liu, W. Wang, X. Gong</title>
        <dc:date>2021-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is a conceptual outline of an Application Programming Interface (API) for the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP). Such an API is needed for Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs) calling the GRASP protocol module to exchange Autonomic Network messages with other ASAs. Since GRASP is designed to support asynchronous operations, the API will need to be adapted according to the support for asynchronicity in various programming languages and operating systems. </description>
