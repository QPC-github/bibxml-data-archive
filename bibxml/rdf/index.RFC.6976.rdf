        <title>RFC 6976: Framework for Loop-Free Convergence Using the Ordered Forwarding Information Base (oFIB) Approach, M. Shand, S. Bryant, S. Previdi, C. Filsfils, P. Francois, O. Bonaventure</title>

        <description>The technology described in this document has been subject to extensive simulation using pathological convergence behavior and real network topologies and costs.  However, the mechanisms described in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification.  This document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document of record.  Further work is needed before implementation or deployment. </description>
