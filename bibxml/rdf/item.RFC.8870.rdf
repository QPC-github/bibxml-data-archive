        <title>RFC 8870: Encrypted Key Transport for DTLS and Secure RTP, C. Jennings, J. Mattsson, D. McGrew, D. Wing, F. Andreasen</title>

        <description>Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that provides for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, rollover counters, and other information within SRTP. This facility enables SRTP for decentralized conferences by distributing a common key to all of the conference endpoints. </description>
