        <title>RFC 6055: IAB Thoughts on Encodings for Internationalized Domain Names, D. Thaler, J. Klensin, S. Cheshire</title>
        <dc:date>2011-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document explores issues with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that result from the use of various encoding schemes such as UTF-8 and the ASCII-Compatible Encoding produced by the Punycode algorithm.  It focuses on the importance of agreeing on a single encoding and how complicated the state of affairs ends up being as a result of using different encodings today. </description>
