        <title>RFC 0918: Post Office Protocol, J.K. Reynolds</title>
        <dc:date>1984-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access    mail from a mailbox server.  The intent of the Post Office Protocol    (POP) is to allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox    server.  It is expected that mail will be posted from the workstation to    the mailbox server via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  This    RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvement.  The status of this    protocol is experimental, and this protocol is dependent upon TCP. </description>
