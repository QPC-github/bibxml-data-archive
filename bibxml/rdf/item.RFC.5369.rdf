        <title>RFC 5369: Framework for Transcoding with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP.  This framework includes how to discover the need for transcoding services in a session and how to invoke those transcoding services.  Two models for transcoding services invocation are discussed: the conference bridge model and the third-party call control model.  Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-impaired individuals.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
