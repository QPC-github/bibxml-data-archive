        <title>RFC 5801: Using Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanisms in Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL): The GS2 Mechanism Family, S. Josefsson, N. Williams</title>
        <dc:date>2010-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/ GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel binding and mutual authentication are supported.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
