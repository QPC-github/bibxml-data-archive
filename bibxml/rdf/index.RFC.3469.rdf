        <title>RFC 3469: Framework for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Recovery, V. Sharma, F. Hellstrand</title>
        <dc:date>2003-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on different paths.  This requires that the label switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the configuration of recovery.  With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.  Restart issues are not included in this framework.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
