        <title>RFC 0941: Addendum to the network service definition covering network layer addressing, </title>
        <dc:date>1985-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This Addendum to the Network Service Definition Standard, ISO 8348,    defines the abstract syntax and semantics of the Network Address    (Network Service Access Point Address).  The Network Address defined in    this Addendum is the address that appears in the primitives of the    connection-mode Network Service as the calling address, called address,    and responding address parameters, and in the primitives of the    connectionless-mode  Network  Service  as  the source address and    destination address parameters.  This document is distributed as an RFC    for information only.  It does not specify a standard for the ARPA-Internet. </description>
