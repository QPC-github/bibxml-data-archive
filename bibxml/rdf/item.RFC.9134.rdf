        <title>RFC 9134: RTP Payload Format for ISO/IEC 21122 (JPEG XS), T. Bruylants, A. Descampe, C. Damman, T. Richter</title>

        <description>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122). JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system. Compared to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher resolutions and video frame rates while offering visually lossless quality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency confined to a fraction of a video frame. </description>
