        <title>RFC 6320: Protocol for Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Networks, S. Wadhwa, J. Moisand, T. Haag, N. Voigt, T. Taylor</title>

        <description>ANCP is based on the General Switch Management Protocol version 3 (GSMPv3) described in RFC 3292, but with many modifications and extensions, to the point that the two protocols are not interoperable.  For this reason, ANCP was assigned a separate version number to distinguish it.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
