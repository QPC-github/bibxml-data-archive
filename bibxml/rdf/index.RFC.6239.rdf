        <title>RFC 6239: Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell (SSH), K. Igoe</title>
        <dc:date>2011-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the architecture of a Suite B compliant implementation of the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication Protocol.  Suite B Secure Shell makes use of the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), the Advanced Encryption Standard running in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM), two members of the SHA-2 family of hashes (SHA-256 and SHA-384), and X.509 certificates.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
