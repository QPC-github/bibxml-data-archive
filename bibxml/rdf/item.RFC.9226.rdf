        <title>RFC 9226: Bioctal: Hexadecimal 2.0, M. Breen</title>
        <dc:date>2022-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The prevailing hexadecimal system was chosen for congruence with groups of four binary digits, but its design exhibits an indifference to cognitive factors.  An alternative is introduced that is designed to reduce brain cycles in cases where a hexadecimal number should be readily convertible to binary by a human being. </description>
