        <title>RFC 8882: DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) Privacy and Security Requirements, C. Huitema, D. Kaiser</title>
        <dc:date>2020-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DNS-SD (DNS-based Service Discovery) normally discloses information about devices offering and requesting services. This information includes hostnames, network parameters, and possibly a further description of the corresponding service instance. Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS-based Service Discovery at a public hotspot, serious privacy problems arise. We analyze the requirements of a privacy-respecting discovery service. </description>
