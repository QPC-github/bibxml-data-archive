        <title>RFC 6356: Coupled Congestion Control for Multipath Transport Protocols, C. Raiciu, M. Handley, D. Wischik</title>
        <dc:date>2011-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow.  The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.  This document defines an Experimental  Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
