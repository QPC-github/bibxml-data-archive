        <title>RFC 7731: Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (MPL), J. Hui, R. Kelsey</title>
        <dc:date>2016-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>MPL has two modes of operation.  One mode uses the Trickle algorithm to manage control-plane and data-plane message transmissions and is applicable for deployments with few multicast sources.  The other mode uses classic flooding.  By providing both modes and parameterization of the Trickle algorithm, an MPL implementation can be used in a variety of multicast deployments and can trade between dissemination latency and transmission efficiency. </description>
