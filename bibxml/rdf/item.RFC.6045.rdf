        <title>RFC 6045: Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID), K. Moriarty</title>
        <dc:date>2010-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RID has found use within the international research communities, but has not been widely adopted in other sectors.  This publication provides the specification to those communities that have adopted it, and communities currently considering solutions for real-time inter-network defense.  The specification may also accelerate development of solutions where different transports or message formats are required by leveraging the data elements and structures specified here.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
