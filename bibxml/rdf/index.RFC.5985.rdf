        <title>RFC 5985: HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD), M. Barnes</title>
        <dc:date>2010-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7 LCP) and describes the use of HTTP and HTTP/TLS as transports for the L7 LCP.  The L7 LCP is used for retrieving location information from a server within an access network.  It includes options for retrieving location information in two forms: by value and by reference.  The protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol that is independent of the session layer.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
