        <title>RFC 4906: Transport of Layer 2 Frames Over MPLS, L. Martini, E. Rosen, N. El-Aawar</title>
        <dc:date>2007-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes methods for transporting the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) of layer 2 protocols such as Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Adaption Layer 5 (AAL5), and Ethernet, and for providing a Synchronized Optical Network (SONET) circuit emulation service across an MPLS network.  This document describes the so-called "draft-martini" protocol, which has since been superseded by the Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge Working Group specifications described in RFC 4447 and related documents.  This memo defines a Historic Document for the Internet community. </description>
