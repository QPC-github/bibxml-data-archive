        <title>RFC 7366: Encrypt-then-MAC for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), P. Gutmann</title>
        <dc:date>2014-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the encrypt-then-MAC security mechanism in place of the existing MAC-then-encrypt mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  The MAC-then-encrypt mechanism has been the subject of a number of security vulnerabilities over a period of many years. </description>
