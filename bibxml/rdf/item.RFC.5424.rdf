        <title>RFC 5424: The Syslog Protocol, R. Gerhards</title>
        <dc:date>2009-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document has been written with the original design goals for traditional syslog in mind.  The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC.  Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues.  This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on.  This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
