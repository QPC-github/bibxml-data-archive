        <title>RFC 6824: TCP Extensions for Multipath Operation with Multiple Addresses, A. Ford, C. Raiciu, M. Handley, O. Bonaventure</title>
        <dc:date>2013-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation.  The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.  This  document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
