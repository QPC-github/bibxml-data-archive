        <title>RFC 7556: Multiple Provisioning Domain Architecture, D. Anipko</title>
        <dc:date>2015-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent connections. </description>
