        <title>RFC 6417: How to Contribute Research Results to Internet Standardization, P. Eardley, L. Eggert, M. Bagnulo, R. Winter</title>

        <description>For an individual researcher, it can however be quite puzzling how to begin to most effectively participate in the IETF and arguably to a much lesser degree, the IRTF.  The interactions in the IETF are much different than those in academic conferences, and effective participation follows different rules.  The goal of this document is to highlight such differences and provide a rough guideline that will hopefully enable researchers new to the IETF to become successful contributors more quickly.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes. </description>
