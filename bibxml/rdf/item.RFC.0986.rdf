        <title>RFC 0986: Guidelines for the use of Internet-IP addresses in the ISO Connectionless-Mode Network Protocol, R.W. Callon, H.W. Braun</title>
        <dc:date>1986-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a method to allow the existing IP addressing,    including the IP protocol field, to be used for the ISO Connectionless    Network Protocol (CLNP).  This is a draft solution to one of the    problems inherent in the use of "ISO-grams" in the DOD Internet.    Related issues will be discussed in subsequent RFCs.  This RFC suggests    a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests    discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
