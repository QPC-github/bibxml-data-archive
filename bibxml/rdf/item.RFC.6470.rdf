        <title>RFC 6470: Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Base Notifications, A. Bierman</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that may impact management applications. Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common system events.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
