        <title>RFC 5475: Sampling and Filtering Techniques for IP Packet Selection, T. Zseby, M. Molina, N. Duffield, S. Niccolini, F. Raspall</title>

        <description>This document describes Sampling and Filtering techniques for IP packet selection.  It provides a categorization of schemes and defines what parameters are needed to describe the most common selection schemes.  Furthermore, it shows how techniques can be combined to build more elaborate packet Selectors.  The document provides the basis for the definition of information models for configuring selection techniques in Metering Processes and for reporting the technique in use to a Collector.
