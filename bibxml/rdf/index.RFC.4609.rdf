        <title>RFC 4609: Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Multicast Routing Security Issues and Enhancements, P. Savola, R. Lehtonen, D. Meyer</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain or inter-domain) multicast routing infrastructures.  Only Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes: the traditional Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model, the source-specific multicast (SSM) model, and the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP) group-to-RP mapping mechanism.  This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations that mitigate the identified threats.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
