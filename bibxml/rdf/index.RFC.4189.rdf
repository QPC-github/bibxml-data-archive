        <title>RFC 4189: Requirements for End-to-Middle Security for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), K. Ono, S. Tachimoto</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) does not always trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers contained in its message.  The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or headers from intermediaries, except those that provide services based on its content.  This situation requires a mechanism called "end-to-middle security" to secure the information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere with end-to-end security.  This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
