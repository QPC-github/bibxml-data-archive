        <title>RFC 9140: Nimble Out-of-Band Authentication for EAP (EAP-NOOB), T. Aura, M. Sethi, A. Peltonen</title>
        <dc:date>2021-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation. The EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that have no preconfigured authentication credentials. The method makes use of a user-assisted, one-directional, out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer device and authentication server to authenticate the in-band key exchange. The device must have a nonnetwork input or output interface, such as a display, microphone, speaker, or blinking light, that can send or receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length. </description>
