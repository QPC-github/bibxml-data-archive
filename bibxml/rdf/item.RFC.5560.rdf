        <title>RFC 5560: A One-Way Packet Duplication Metric, H. Uijterwaal</title>
        <dc:date>2009-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In earlier work, a metric for packet loss was defined.  This metric quantifies the case where a packet that is sent does not arrive at its destination within a reasonable time.  In this memo, a metric for another case is defined: a packet is sent, but multiple copies arrive.  The document also discusses streams and methods to summarize the results of streams.
