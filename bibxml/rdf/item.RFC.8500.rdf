        <title>RFC 8500: IS-IS Routing with Reverse Metric, N. Shen, S. Amante, M. Abrahamsson</title>
        <dc:date>2019-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a mechanism to allow IS-IS routing to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from either a point-to-point or multi-access LAN interface during network maintenance or other operational events.  This is accomplished by signaling adjacent IS-IS neighbors with a higher reverse metric, i.e., the metric towards the signaling IS-IS router. </description>
