        <title>RFC 7562: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Using Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) Certificates, D. Thakore</title>
        <dc:date>2015-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the use of Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) certificates as an authorization data type in the authorization extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  This is in accordance with the guidelines for authorization extensions as specified in RFC 5878.  As with other TLS extensions, this authorization data can be included in the client and server hello messages to confirm that both parties support the desired authorization data types.  If supported by both the client and the server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental data TLS handshake message as specified in RFC 4680.  This authorization data type extension is in support of devices containing DTCP certificates issued by the Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator (DTLA). </description>
