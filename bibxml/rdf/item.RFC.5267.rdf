        <title>RFC 5267: Contexts for IMAP4, D. Cridland, C. King</title>
        <dc:date>2008-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IMAP4rev1 protocol has powerful search facilities as part of the core protocol, but lacks the ability to create live, updated results that can be easily handled.  This memo provides such an extension, and shows how it can be used to provide a facility similar to virtual mailboxes.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
