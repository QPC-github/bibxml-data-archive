        <description>This document is the result of cooperative efforts within the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization separate from the IETF.  The original MAAWG document upon which this document is based was published in April, 2010.  This document does not represent the consensus of the IETF; rather it is being published as an Informational RFC to make it widely available to the Internet community and simplify reference to this material from IETF work. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
