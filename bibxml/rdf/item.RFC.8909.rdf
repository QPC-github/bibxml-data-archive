        <title>RFC 8909: Registry Data Escrow Specification, G. Lozano</title>
        <dc:date>2020-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the format and contents of data escrow deposits targeted primarily for domain name registries.   The specification is designed to be independent of the underlying objects that are being escrowed, and therefore it could also be used for purposes other than domain name registries. </description>
