        <title>RFC 4106: The Use of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) in IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), J. Viega, D. McGrew</title>
        <dc:date>2005-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as an IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) mechanism to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication.  This method can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
