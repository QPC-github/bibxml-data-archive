        <title>RFC 4096: Policy-Mandated Labels Such as "Adv:" in Email Subject Headers Considered Ineffective At Best, C. Malamud</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses policies that require certain labels to be inserted in the "Subject:" header of a mail message.  Such policies are difficult to specify accurately while remaining compliant with key RFCs and are likely to be ineffective at best.  This memo discusses an alternate, \%standards-compliant approach that is significantly simpler to specify and is somewhat less likely to be ineffective.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
