        <title>RFC 5035: Enhanced Security Services (ESS) Update: Adding CertID Algorithm Agility, J. Schaad</title>
        <dc:date>2007-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In the original Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME document (RFC 2634), a structure for cryptographically linking the certificate to be used in validation with the signature was introduced; this structure was hardwired to use SHA-1.  This document allows for the structure to have algorithm agility and defines a new attribute for this purpose.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
