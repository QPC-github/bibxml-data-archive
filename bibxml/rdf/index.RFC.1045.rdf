        <title>RFC 1045: VMTP: Versatile Message Transaction Protocol: Protocol specification, D.R. Cheriton</title>
        <dc:date>1988-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo specifies the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol (VMTP) [Version 0.7 of 19-Feb-88], a transport protocol specifically designed to support the transaction model of communication, as exemplified by remote procedure call (RPC).  The full function of VMTP, including support for security, real-time, asynchronous message exchanges, streaming, multicast and idempotency, provides a rich selection to the VMTP user level.  Subsettability allows the VMTP module for particular clients and servers to be specialized and simplified to the services actually required.  Examples of such simple clients and servers include PROM network bootload programs, network boot servers, data sensors and simple controllers, to mention but a few examples.  This RFC describes a protocol proposed as a standard for the Internet community. </description>
