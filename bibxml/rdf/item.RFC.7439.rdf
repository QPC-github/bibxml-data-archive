        <title>RFC 7439: Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-Only MPLS Networks, W. George, C. Pignataro</title>
        <dc:date>2015-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6, and MPLS labeled packets can be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations. However, support for IPv6 among MPLS control-plane protocols, MPLS applications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), and MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps.  For most major gaps, work is in progress to upgrade the relevant protocols. </description>
