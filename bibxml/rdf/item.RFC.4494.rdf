        <title>RFC 4494: The AES-CMAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use with IPsec, JH. Song, R. Poovendran, J. Lee</title>
        <dc:date>2006-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC), which is equivalent to the One-Key CBC-MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa.  OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of Extended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC).  This memo specifies the use of CMAC mode as an authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) protocols.  This new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
