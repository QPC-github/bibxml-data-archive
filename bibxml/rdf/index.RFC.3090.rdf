        <title>RFC 3090: DNS Security Extension Clarification on Zone Status, E. Lewis</title>
        <dc:date>2001-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The definition of a secured zone is presented, clarifying and updating sections of RFC 2535.  RFC 2535 defines a zone to be secured based on a per algorithm basis, e.g., a zone can be secured with RSA keys, and not secured with DSA keys.  This document changes this to define a zone to be secured or not secured regardless of the key algorithm used (or not used).  To further simplify the determination of a zone's status, "experimentally secure" status is deprecated.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
