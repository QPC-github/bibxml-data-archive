        <title>RFC 7912: Message Authorizing Email Header Field and Its Use for the Draft and Release Procedure, A. Melnikov</title>
        <dc:date>2016-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a procedure for when a Military Message Handling System (MMHS) message is composed by one user and is only released to the mail transfer system when one or more Authorizing Users authorize release of the message by adding the MMHS-Authorizing-Users header field.  The resulting message can be optionally signed by the sender and/or reviewer, allowing recipients to verify both the original signature (if any) and the review signatures. </description>
