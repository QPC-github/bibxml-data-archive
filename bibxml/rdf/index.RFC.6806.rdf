        <title>RFC 6806: Kerberos Principal Name Canonicalization and Cross-Realm Referrals, S. Hartman, K. Raeburn, L. Zhu</title>
        <dc:date>2012-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo documents a method for a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) to respond to client requests for Kerberos tickets when the client does not have detailed configuration information on the realms of users or services.  The KDC will handle requests for principals in other realms by returning either a referral error or a cross-realm Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) to another realm on the referral path. The clients will use this referral information to reach the realm of the target principal and then receive the ticket.  This memo also provides a mechanism for verifying that a request has not been tampered with in transit.  This memo updates RFC 4120.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
