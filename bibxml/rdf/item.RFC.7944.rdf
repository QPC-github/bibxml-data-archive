        <title>RFC 7944: Diameter Routing Message Priority, S. Donovan</title>
        <dc:date>2016-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When making routing and resource allocation decisions, Diameter nodes currently have no generic mechanism to determine the relative priority of Diameter messages.  This document addresses this by defining a mechanism to allow Diameter endpoints to indicate the relative priority of Diameter transactions.  With this information, Diameter nodes can factor that priority into routing, resource allocation, and overload abatement decisions. </description>
