        <title>RFC 4488: Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER Method Implicit Subscription, O. Levin</title>
        <dc:date>2006-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined in RFC 3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event subscription used to notify the party sending a REFER request about the receiver's status in executing the transaction requested by the REFER.  These notifications are not needed in all cases.  This specification provides a way to prevent the automatic establishment of an event subscription and subsequent notifications using a new SIP extension header field that may be included in a REFER request.
