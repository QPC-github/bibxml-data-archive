        <title>RFC 8433: A Simpler Method for Resolving Alert-Info URNs, D. Worley</title>
        <dc:date>2018-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 7462 describes a non-normative algorithm for signal selection. This document describes a more efficient alternative algorithm: a user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the definition of the "alert" URN namespace. </description>
