        <description>The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) Committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11) is a working group in ISO that produced the MPEG-4 standard.  MPEG defines tools to compress content such as audio-visual information into elementary streams.  This specification defines a simple, but generic RTP payload format for transport of any non-multiplexed MPEG-4 elementary stream. </description>
