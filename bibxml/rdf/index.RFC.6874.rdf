        <title>RFC 6874: Representing IPv6 Zone Identifiers in Address Literals and Uniform Resource Identifiers, B. Carpenter, S. Cheshire, R. Hinden</title>
        <dc:date>2013-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped address, defined as <zone_id> in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a Uniform Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address.  It updates the URI Generic Syntax specification (RFC 3986) accordingly. </description>
