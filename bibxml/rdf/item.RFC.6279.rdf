        <title>RFC 6279: Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) Localized Routing Problem Statement, M. Liebsch, S. Jeong, Q. Wu</title>
        <dc:date>2011-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF Standard for network-based mobility management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically anchored at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for registered mobile nodes.  The setup and maintenance of localized routing, which allows forwarding of data packets between two mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without involvement of their Local Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered.  This document describes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
