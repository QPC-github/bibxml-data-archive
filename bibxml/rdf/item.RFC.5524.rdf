        <title>RFC 5524: Extended URLFETCH for Binary and Converted Parts, D. Cridland</title>
        <dc:date>2009-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The URLFETCH command defined as part of URLAUTH provides a mechanism for third parties to gain access to data held within messages in a user's private store; however, this data is sent verbatim, which is not suitable for a number of applications.  This memo specifies a method for obtaining data in forms suitable for non-mail applications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
