        <title>RFC 9178: Building Power-Efficient Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Devices for Cellular Networks, J. Arkko, A. Eriksson, A. Keränen</title>
        <dc:date>2022-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in building sensors and other devices that employ cellular networks as a communications medium. Building communicating devices that employ these networks is obviously well known, but this memo focuses specifically on techniques necessary to minimize power consumption. </description>
