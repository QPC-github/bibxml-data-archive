        <title>RFC 8125: Requirements for Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) Schemes, J. Schmidt</title>
        <dc:date>2017-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes are interactive protocols that allow the participants to authenticate each other and derive shared cryptographic keys using a (weaker) shared password. This document reviews different types of PAKE schemes.  Furthermore, it presents requirements and gives recommendations to designers of new schemes.  It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG). </description>
