        <title>RFC 6928: Increasing TCP's Initial Window, J. Chu, N. Dukkipati, Y. Cheng, M. Mathis</title>
        <dc:date>2013-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document proposes an experiment to increase the permitted TCP initial window (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390, to 10 segments with a fallback to the existing recommendation when performance issues are detected.  It discusses the motivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages of the higher initial window, and presents results from several large-scale experiments showing that the higher initial window improves the overall performance of many web services without resulting in a congestion collapse.  The document closes with a discussion of usage and deployment for further experimental purposes recommended by the IETF TCP Maintenance and Minor Extensions (TCPM) working group. </description>
