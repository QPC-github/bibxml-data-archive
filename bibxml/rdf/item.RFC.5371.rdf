        <title>RFC 5371: RTP Payload Format for JPEG 2000 Video Streams, S. Futemma, E. Itakura, A. Leung</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the ISO/IEC International Standard 15444-1 | ITU-T Rec. T.800, better known as JPEG 2000.  JPEG 2000 features are considered in the design of this payload format.  JPEG 2000 is a truly scalable compression technology allowing applications to encode once and decode many different ways. The JPEG 2000 video stream is formed by extending from a single image to a series of JPEG 2000 images.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
