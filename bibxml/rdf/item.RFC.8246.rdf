        <title>RFC 8246: HTTP Immutable Responses, P. McManus</title>
        <dc:date>2017-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness lifetime.  This ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be certain it has not been modified. </description>
