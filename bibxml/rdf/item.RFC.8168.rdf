        <title>RFC 8168: DHCPv6 Prefix-Length Hint Issues, T. Li, C. Liu, Y. Cui</title>
        <dc:date>2017-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation allows a client to include a prefix-length hint value in the IA_PD option to indicate a preference for the size of the prefix to be delegated, but it is unclear about how the client and server should act in different situations involving the prefix-length hint.  This document provides a summary of the existing problems with the prefix-length hint and guidance on what the client and server could do in different situations. </description>
