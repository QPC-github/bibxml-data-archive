        <title>RFC 6568: Design and Application Spaces for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs), E. Kim, D. Kaspar, JP. Vasseur</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document investigates potential application scenarios and use cases for low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs).  This document provides dimensions of design space for LoWPAN applications. A list of use cases and market domains that may benefit and motivate the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN Working Group is provided with the characteristics of each dimension.  A complete list of practical use cases is not the goal of this document.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
