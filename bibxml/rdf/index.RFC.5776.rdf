        <title>RFC 5776: Use of Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) in the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) and NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) Protocols, V. Roca, A. Francillon, S. Faurite</title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document details the Timed Efficient Stream \%Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) packet source authentication and packet integrity verification protocol and its integration within the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) and NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) content delivery protocols.  This document only considers the authentication/integrity verification of the packets generated by the session's sender.  The authentication and integrity verification of the packets sent by receivers, if any, is out of the scope of this document.  This document defines an Experimental  Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
