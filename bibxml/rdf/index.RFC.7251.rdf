        <title>RFC 7251: AES-CCM Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for TLS, D. McGrew, D. Bailey, M. Campagna, R. Dugal</title>
        <dc:date>2014-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data-origin authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments, while at the same time providing a high level of security.  The cipher suites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and are advantageous in networks with limited bandwidth. </description>
