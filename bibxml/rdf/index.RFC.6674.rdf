        <title>RFC 6674: Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite Deployment, F. Brockners, S. Gundavelli, S. Speicher, D. Ward</title>
        <dc:date>2012-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite (GI-DS-Lite) is a variant of Dual- Stack Lite (DS-Lite) applicable to certain tunnel-based access architectures.  GI-DS-Lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the access gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using softwires with an embedded Context Identifier that uniquely identifies the end-system to which the tunneled packets belong.  The access gateway determines which portion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies and sends/ receives this portion to/from this softwire.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
