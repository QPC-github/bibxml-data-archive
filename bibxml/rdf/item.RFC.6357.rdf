        <title>RFC 6357: Design Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload Control, V. Hilt, E. Noel, C. Shen, A. Abdelal</title>
        <dc:date>2011-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This document discusses models and design considerations for a SIP overload control mechanism.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
