        <title>RFC 8533: A YANG Data Model for Retrieval Methods for the Management of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Protocols That Use Connectionless Communications, D. Kumar, M. Wang, Q. Wu, R. Rahman, S. Raghavan</title>

        <description>This document presents a retrieval method YANG data model for connectionless Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols.  It provides technology-independent RPC operations for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication.  The retrieval methods model herein presented can be extended to include technology- specific details.  There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols.  Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or the same levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same levels through a unified interface). </description>
