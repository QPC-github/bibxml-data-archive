        <title>RFC 8537: Updates to the Fast Reroute Procedures for Co-routed Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs), R. Gandhi, H. Shah, J. Whittaker</title>
        <dc:date>2019-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be used to bind two unidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs) into an associated bidirectional LSP.  When an associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path as its forward LSP.  This document updates the fast reroute procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the procedure for associating two reverse LSPs defined in RFC 7551 to support co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The fast reroute procedures can ensure that, for the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure event. </description>
