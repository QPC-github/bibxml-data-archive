        <title>RFC 5432: Quality of Service (QoS) Mechanism Selection in the Session Description Protocol (SDP), J. Polk, S. Dhesikan, G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2009-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The offer/answer model for the Session Description Protocol (SDP) assumes that endpoints somehow establish the Quality of Service (QoS) required for the media streams they establish.  Endpoints in closed environments typically agree out-of-band (e.g., using configuration information) regarding which QoS mechanism to use.  However, on the Internet, there is more than one QoS service available.  Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism to negotiate which QoS mechanism to use for a particular media stream.  This document defines such a mechanism.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
