        <title>RFC 8943: Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date, M. Jones, A. Nadalin, J. Richter</title>
        <dc:date>2020-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX "seconds since the epoch"). Since then, additional requirements have become known. This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric date representation without a time. This specification is the reference document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined. </description>
