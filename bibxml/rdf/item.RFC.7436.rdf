        <title>RFC 7436: IP-Only LAN Service (IPLS), H. Shah, E. Rosen, F. Le Faucheur, G. Heron</title>
        <dc:date>2015-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The original intent was to provide an alternate solution to VPLS for those Provider Edge (PE) routers that were not capable of learning MAC addresses through data plane.  This became a non-issue with newer hardware.  The concepts put forth by this document are still valuable and are adopted in one form or other by newer work such as Ethernet VPN in L2VPN working group and possible data center applications.  At this point, no further action is planned to update this document and it is published simply as a historic record of the ideas. </description>
