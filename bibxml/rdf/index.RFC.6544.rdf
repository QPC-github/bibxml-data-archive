        <title>RFC 6544: TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), J. Rosenberg, A. Keranen, B. B. Lowekamp, A. B. Roach</title>
        <dc:date>2012-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework for describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams. This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
