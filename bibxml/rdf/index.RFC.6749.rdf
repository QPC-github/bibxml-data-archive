        <title>RFC 6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, D. Hardt</title>
        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
