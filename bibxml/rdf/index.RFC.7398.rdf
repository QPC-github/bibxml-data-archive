        <title>RFC 7398: A Reference Path and Measurement Points for Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance, M. Bagnulo, T. Burbridge, S. Crawford, P. Eardley, A. Morton</title>
        <dc:date>2015-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for commonly used performance metrics.  Other similar measurement projects may also be able to use the extensions described here for measurement point location.  The purpose is to create an efficient way to describe the location of the measurement point(s) used to conduct a particular measurement. </description>
