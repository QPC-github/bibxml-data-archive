        <title>RFC 8086: GRE-in-UDP Encapsulation, L. Yong, E. Crabbe, X. Xu, T. Herbert</title>
        <dc:date>2017-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a method of encapsulating network protocol packets within GRE and UDP headers.  This GRE-in-UDP encapsulation allows the UDP source port field to be used as an entropy field. This may be used for load-balancing of GRE traffic in transit networks using existing Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) mechanisms. There are two applicability scenarios for GRE-in-UDP with different requirements: (1) general Internet and (2) a traffic-managed controlled environment.  The controlled environment has less restrictive requirements than the general Internet. </description>
