        <title>RFC 6794: A Framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies, V. Hilt, G. Camarillo, J. Rosenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2012-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features.  This document specifies a framework for SIP session policies that provides a standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies on sessions, such as the codecs or media types to be used.  It defines a model, an overall architecture and new protocol mechanisms for session policies.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
