        <title>RFC 6738: Diameter IKEv2 SK: Using Shared Keys to Support Interaction between IKEv2 Servers and Diameter Servers, V. Cakulev, A. Lior, S. Mizikovsky</title>

        <description>Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent (HA), as a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified. However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not include support for SK-based authentication available with IKEv2. This document specifies the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-server communication when the IKEv2 peer authenticates using IKEv2 with SK. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
