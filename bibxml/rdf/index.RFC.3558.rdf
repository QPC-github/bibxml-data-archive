        <title>RFC 3558: RTP Payload Format for Enhanced Variable Rate Codecs (EVRC) and Selectable Mode Vocoders (SMV), A. Li</title>
        <dc:date>2003-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC) Speech and Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) Speech.  Two sub-formats are specified for different application scenarios.  A bundled/interleaved format is included to reduce the effect of packet loss on speech quality and amortize the overhead of the RTP header over more than one speech frame.  A non-bundled format is also supported for conversational applications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
