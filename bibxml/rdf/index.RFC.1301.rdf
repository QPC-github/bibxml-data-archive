        <title>RFC 1301: Multicast Transport Protocol, S. Armstrong, A. Freier, K. Marzullo</title>
        <dc:date>1992-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a protocol for reliable transport that utilizes the multicast capability of applicable lower layer networking architectures. The transport definition permits an arbitrary number of transport providers to perform realtime collaborations without requiring networking clients (aka, applications) to possess detailed knowledge of the population or geographical dispersion of the participating members. It is not network architectural specific, but does implicitly require some form of multicasting (or broadcasting) at the data link level, as well as some means of communicating that capability up through the layers to the transport.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
