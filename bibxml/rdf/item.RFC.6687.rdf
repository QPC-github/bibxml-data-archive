        <title>RFC 6687: Performance Evaluation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), J. Tripathi, J. de Oliveira, JP. Vasseur</title>
        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document presents a performance evaluation of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for a small outdoor deployment of sensor nodes and for a large-scale smart meter network. Detailed simulations are carried out to produce several routing performance metrics using these real-life deployment scenarios. Please refer to the PDF version of this document, which includes several plots for the performance metrics not shown in the plain-text version.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
