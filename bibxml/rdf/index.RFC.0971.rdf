        <title>RFC 0971: Survey of data representation standards, A.L. DeSchon</title>
        <dc:date>1986-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC is a comparison of several data representation standards that    are currently in use.  The standards discussed are the CCITT X.409    recommendation, the NBS Computer Based Message System (CBMS) standard,    DARPA Multimedia Mail system, the Courier remote procedure call    protocol, and the SUN Remote Procedure Call package.  No proposals in    this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this    time.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to    the appropriate approach to a data representation standard, leading    eventually to the adoption of an ARPA-Internet standard. </description>
