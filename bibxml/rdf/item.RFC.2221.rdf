        <title>RFC 2221: IMAP4 Login Referrals, M. Gahrns</title>
        <dc:date>1997-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When dealing with large amounts of users and many IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers, it is often necessary to move users from one IMAP4 server to another.  Login referrals allow clients to transparently connect to an alternate IMAP4 server, if their home IMAP4 server has changed. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
