        <title>RFC 7975: Request Routing Redirection Interface for Content Delivery Network (CDN) Interconnection, B. Niven-Jenkins, R. van Brandenburg</title>
        <dc:date>2016-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Request Routing interface comprises (1) the asynchronous advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream Content Delivery Network (CDN) that allows an upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an interface for the latter part, i.e., the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface. </description>
