        <title>RFC 4077: A Negative Acknowledgement Mechanism for Signaling Compression, A.B. Roach</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a mechanism that allows Signaling Compression (SigComp) implementations to report precise error information upon receipt of a message which cannot be decompressed.  This negative feedback can be used by the recipient to make fine-grained adjustments to the compressed message before retransmitting it, allowing for rapid and efficient recovery from error situations.
