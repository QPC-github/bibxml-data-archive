        <title>RFC 7151: File Transfer Protocol HOST Command for Virtual Hosts, P. Hethmon, R. McMurray</title>
        <dc:date>2014-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The File Transfer Protocol, as defined in RFC 959, does not provide a way for FTP clients and servers to differentiate between multiple DNS names that are registered for a single IP address.  This document defines a new FTP command that provides a mechanism for FTP clients and servers to identify individual virtual hosts on an FTP server. </description>
