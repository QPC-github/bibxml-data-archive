        <title>RFC 3929: Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-Blocked Decisions in the IETF, T. Hardie</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-making processes for use in IETF working groups.  There are a small number of cases in IETF working groups in which the group has come to consensus that a particular decision must be made but cannot agree on the decision itself.  This document describes alternative mechanisms for reaching a decision in those cases.  This is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools that can be used when needed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
