        <description>This memo is a discussion of some of the ideas expressed in RFC-1016 on Source Quench.  This memo introduces the distinction of the cause of congestion in a gateway between the effects of "Funneling" and Mismatch".  It is offered in the same spirit as RFC-1016; to stimulate discussion.  The opinions offered are personal, not corporate, opinions. </description>
