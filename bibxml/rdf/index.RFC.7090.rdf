        <title>RFC 7090: Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Callback, H. Schulzrinne, H. Tschofenig, C. Holmberg, M. Patel</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the caller without unnecessary delays.  Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior would be desirable.  We describe a solution based on a new header field value for the SIP Priority header field, called "psap-callback", to mark PSAP callbacks. </description>
