        <title>RFC 6325: Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification, R. Perlman, D. Eastlake 3rd, D. Dutt, S. Gai, A. Ghanwani</title>

        <description>The design supports VLANs and the optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN ID and based on IP-derived multicast groups.  It also allows unicast forwarding tables at transit RBridges to be sized according to the number of RBridges (rather than the number of end nodes), which allows their forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional customer bridges.
