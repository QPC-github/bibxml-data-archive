        <title>RFC 7696: Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms, R. Housley</title>
        <dc:date>2015-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication, or digital signature.  Communicating peers must support a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate from one mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another over time. </description>
