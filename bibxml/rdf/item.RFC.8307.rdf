        <title>RFC 8307: Well-Known URIs for the WebSocket Protocol, C. Bormann</title>
        <dc:date>2018-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, "/.well-known/", that can be used by well-known URIs.  It was specifically defined for the "http" and "https" URI schemes.  The present memo formally updates RFC 6455, which defines the URI schemes defined for the WebSocket Protocol, to extend the use of these well-known URIs to those URI schemes. </description>
