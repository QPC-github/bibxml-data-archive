        <title>RFC 0998: NETBLT: A bulk data transfer protocol, D.D. Clark, M.L. Lambert, L. Zhang</title>
        <dc:date>1987-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is a description of, and a specification for, the NETBLT    protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published in RFC-969.    NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended    for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.    It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is    designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.    Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it    should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in    function to IP. This document is published for discussion and comment,    and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain    parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this    document is therefore not advised.  Obsoletes  RFC-969. </description>
