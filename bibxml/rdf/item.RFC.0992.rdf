        <title>RFC 0992: On communication support for fault tolerant process groups, K.P. Birman, T.A. Joseph</title>
        <dc:date>1986-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a collection of multicast communication primitives    integrated with a mechanism for handling process failure and recovery.    These primitives facilitate the implementation of fault-tolerant process    groups, which can be used to provide distributed services in an    environment subject to non-malicious crash failures. </description>
