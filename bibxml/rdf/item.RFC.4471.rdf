        <title>RFC 4471: Derivation of DNS Name Predecessor and Successor, G. Sisson, B. Laurie</title>
        <dc:date>2006-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes two methods for deriving the canonically-ordered predecessor and successor of a DNS name.  These methods may be used for dynamic NSEC resource record synthesis, enabling security-aware name servers to provide authenticated denial of existence without disclosing other owner names in a DNSSEC secured zone.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
