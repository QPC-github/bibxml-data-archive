        <title>RFC 8099: OSPF Topology-Transparent Zone, H. Chen, R. Li, A. Retana, Y. Yang, Z. Liu</title>

        <description>This document presents a Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) in an OSPF area.  A TTZ comprises a group of routers and a number of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  A TTZ hides the internal topology of the TTZ from the outside.  It does not directly advertise any internal information about the TTZ to a router outside of the TTZ.  The information about the links and routers such as a link down inside the TTZ is not advertised to any router outside of the TTZ. </description>
