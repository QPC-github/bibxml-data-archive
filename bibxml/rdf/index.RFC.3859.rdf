        <title>RFC 3859: Common Profile for Presence (CPP), J. Peterson</title>
        <dc:date>2004-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols were in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved.  This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
