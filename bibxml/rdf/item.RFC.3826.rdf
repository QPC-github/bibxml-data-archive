        <title>RFC 3826: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher Algorithm in the SNMP User-based Security Model, U. Blumenthal, F. Maino, K. McCloghrie</title>
        <dc:date>2004-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a symmetric encryption protocol that supplements the protocols described in the User-based Security Model (USM), which is a Security Subsystem for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol for use in the SNMP Architecture.  The symmetric encryption protocol described in this document is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher algorithm used in Cipher FeedBack Mode (CFB), with a key size of 128 bits.
