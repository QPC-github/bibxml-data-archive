        <title>RFC 5688: A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Media Feature Tag for MIME Application Subtypes, J. Rosenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2010-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The caller preferences specification for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a caller to express preferences that the call be routed to a User Agent (UA) with particular capabilities. Similarly, a specification exists to allow a UA to indicate its capabilities in a registration.  Amongst those capabilities are the type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME types.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range of stream types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a capability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which application subtypes the agent supports.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
