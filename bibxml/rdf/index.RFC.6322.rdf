        <title>RFC 6322: Datatracker States and Annotations for the IAB, IRTF, and Independent Submission Streams, P. Hoffman</title>
        <dc:date>2011-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes extending the IETF Datatracker to capture and display the progression of Internet-Drafts that are intended to be published as RFCs by the IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submissions Editor.  The states and annotations that are to be added to the Datatracker will be applied to Internet-Drafts as soon as any of these streams identify the Internet-Draft as a potential eventual RFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the Internet-Draft. The goal of adding this information to the Datatracker is to give the whole Internet community more information about the status of these Internet-Drafts and the streams from which they originate. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
