        <title>RFC 7332: Loop Detection Mechanisms for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs), H. Kaplan, V. Pascual</title>
        <dc:date>2014-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) can cause unending SIP request routing loops because, as User Agent Clients, they can generate SIP requests with new Max-Forwards values.  This document discusses the difficulties associated with loop detection for B2BUAs and the requirements for them to prevent infinite loops. </description>
