        <title>RFC 8045: RADIUS Extensions for IP Port Configuration and Reporting, D. Cheng, J. Korhonen, M. Boucadair, S. Sivakumar</title>
        <dc:date>2017-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines three new RADIUS attributes.  For devices that implement IP port ranges, these attributes are used to communicate with a RADIUS server in order to configure and report IP transport ports as well as mapping behavior for specific hosts.  This mechanism can be used in various deployment scenarios such as Carrier-Grade NAT, IPv4/IPv6 translators, Provider WLAN gateway, etc.  This document defines a mapping between some RADIUS attributes and IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Information Element identifiers. </description>
