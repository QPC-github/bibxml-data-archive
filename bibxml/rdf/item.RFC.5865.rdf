        <title>RFC 5865: A Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for Capacity-Admitted Traffic, F. Baker, J. Polk, M. Dolly</title>
        <dc:date>2010-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of real-time traffic.  This traffic class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior.  This traffic is also admitted by the network using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.  This differs from a real-time traffic class that conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per-Hop Behavior but is not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse capacity admission.
