        <title>RFC 1639: FTP Operation Over Big Address Records (FOOBAR), D. Piscitello</title>
        <dc:date>1994-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC specifies a method for assigning addresses other than 32-bit IPv4 addresses to data ports through the specification of a "long Port (LPRT)" command and "Long Passive (LPSV)" reply, each having as its argument a <long-host-port>, which allows for additional address families, variable length network addresses and variable length port numbers.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
