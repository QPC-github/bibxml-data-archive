        <title>RFC 8588: Personal Assertion Token (PaSSporT) Extension for Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs (SHAKEN), C. Wendt, M. Barnes</title>
        <dc:date>2019-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which is a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information about the participants involved in communications.  The extension is defined based on the "Signature-based Handling of Asserted                                     information using toKENs (SHAKEN)" specification by the ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Group.  It provides both (1) a specific set of levels of confidence in the correctness of the originating identity of a call originated in a SIP-based telephone network as well as (2) an identifier that allows the Service Provider (SP) to uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network. </description>
