        <dc:date>2000-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In this document, a number of popular extensions to the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) protocol defined in RFC 977 are documented and discussed.  While this document is not intended to serve as a standard of any kind, it will hopefully serve as a reference document for future implementers of the NNTP protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
