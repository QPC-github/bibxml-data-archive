        <title>RFC 6429: TCP Sender Clarification for Persist Condition, M. Bashyam, M. Jethanandani, A. Ramaiah</title>
        <dc:date>2011-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in RFC 1122 ("Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"). In particular, it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections that are experiencing the ZWP condition.  Rather than making a change to the standard, this document clarifies what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified in RFC 1122.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
