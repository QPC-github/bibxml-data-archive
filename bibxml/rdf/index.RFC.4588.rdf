        <title>RFC 4588: RTP Retransmission Payload Format, J. Rey, D. Leon, A. Miyazaki, V. Varsa, R. Hakenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2006-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds.  This document describes an RTP payload format for performing retransmissions. Retransmitted RTP packets are sent in a separate stream from the original RTP stream.  It is assumed that feedback from receivers to senders is available.  In particular, it is assumed that Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback as defined in the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (denoted RTP/AVPF) is available in this memo.
