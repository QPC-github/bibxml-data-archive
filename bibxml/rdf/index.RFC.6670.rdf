        <title>RFC 6670: The Reasons for Selecting a Single Solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), N. Sprecher, KY. Hong</title>
        <dc:date>2012-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>One major set of additions provides enhanced support for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  This enables fault management and performance monitoring to the level needed in a transport network.  Many solutions and protocol extensions have been proposed to address the requirements for MPLS-TP OAM, and this document sets out the reasons for selecting a single, coherent set of solutions for standardization.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
