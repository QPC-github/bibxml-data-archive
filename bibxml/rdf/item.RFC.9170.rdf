        <title>RFC 9170: Long-Term Viability of Protocol Extension Mechanisms, M. Thomson, T. Pauly</title>
        <dc:date>2021-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The ability to change protocols depends on exercising the extension and version-negotiation mechanisms that support change.  This document explores how regular use of new protocol features can ensure that it remains possible to deploy changes to a protocol. Examples are given where lack of use caused changes to be more difficult or costly. </description>
