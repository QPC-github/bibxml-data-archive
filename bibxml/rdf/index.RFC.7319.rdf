        <description>IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities.  CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV-structured information.  IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF.  This document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of values from these blocks. </description>
