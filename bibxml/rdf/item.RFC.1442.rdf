        <description>Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1].  It is the purpose of this document, the Structure of Management Information (SMI), to define that subset. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
