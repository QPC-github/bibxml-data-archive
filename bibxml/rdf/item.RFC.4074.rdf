        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There is some known misbehavior of DNS authoritative servers when they are queried for AAAA resource records.  Such behavior can block IPv4 communication that should actually be available, cause a significant delay in name resolution, or even make a denial of service attack. This memo describes details of known cases and discusses their effects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
