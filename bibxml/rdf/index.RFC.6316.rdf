        <title>RFC 6316: Sockets Application Program Interface (API) for Multihoming Shim, M. Komu, M. Bagnulo, K. Slavov, S. Sugimoto</title>
        <dc:date>2011-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is based on an assumption that a multihomed host is equipped with a conceptual sub-layer (hereafter called "shim sub- layer") inside the IP layer that maintains mappings between identifiers and locators.  Examples of the shim are Shim6 and the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes. </description>
