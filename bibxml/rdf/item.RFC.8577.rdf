        <title>RFC 8577: Signaling RSVP-TE Tunnels on a Shared MPLS Forwarding Plane, H. Sitaraman, V. Beeram, T. Parikh, T. Saad</title>

        <description>This document defines a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of the label space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control-plane scaling on that node.  It introduces the notion of preinstalled 'per-TE link labels' that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these TE links.  This approach significantly reduces the forwarding-plane state required to support a large number of LSPs. This couples the feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with the simplicity of the Segment Routing (SR) MPLS forwarding plane. </description>
