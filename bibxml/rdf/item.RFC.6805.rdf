        <title>RFC 6805: The Application of the Path Computation Element Architecture to the Determination of a Sequence of Domains in MPLS and GMPLS, D. King, A. Farrel</title>
        <dc:date>2012-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance.  The document shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship between domains.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
