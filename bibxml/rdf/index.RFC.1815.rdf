        <description>For the practical use of ISO 10646, a lot of external profiling such as restriction of characters, restriction of combination of characters and addition of language information is necessary.  This memo provides information on such profiling, along with charset names to each profiled instance.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
