        <title>RFC 1948: Defending Against Sequence Number Attacks, S. Bellovin</title>
        <dc:date>1996-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IP spoofing attacks based on sequence number spoofing have become a serious threat on the Internet (CERT Advisory CA-95:01).  While ubiquitous crypgraphic authentication is the right answer, we propose a simple modification to TCP implementations that should be a very substantial block to the current wave of attacks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
