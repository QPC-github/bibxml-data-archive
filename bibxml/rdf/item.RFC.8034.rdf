        <title>RFC 8034: Active Queue Management (AQM) Based on Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced PIE) for Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) Cable Modems, G. White, R. Pan</title>

        <description>Cable modems based on Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) provide broadband Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide.  In some cases, the cable modem connection is the bottleneck (lowest speed) link between the customer and the Internet.  As a result, the impact of buffering and bufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user experience.  The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification introduces requirements for cable modems to support an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact that buffering has on latency-sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk throughput performance.  In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications have also been amended to contain similar requirements.  This document describes the requirements on AQM that apply to DOCSIS equipment, including a description of the "DOCSIS-PIE" algorithm that is required on DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems. </description>
