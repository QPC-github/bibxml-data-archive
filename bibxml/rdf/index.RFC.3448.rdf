        <title>RFC 3448: TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification, M. Handley, S. Floyd, J. Padhye, J. Widmer</title>

        <description>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.
