        <title>RFC 9212: Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite Cryptography for Secure Shell (SSH), N. Gajcowski, M. Jenkins</title>
        <dc:date>2022-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The United States Government has published the National Security Agency (NSA) Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms with the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication Protocol. It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems (described in NIST Special Publication 800-59) that employ Secure Shell (SSH).  This document is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments. </description>
