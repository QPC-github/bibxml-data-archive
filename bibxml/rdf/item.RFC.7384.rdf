        <title>RFC 7384: Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks, T. Mizrahi</title>
        <dc:date>2014-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>As time and frequency distribution protocols are becoming increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security threats is increasing.  This document defines a set of security requirements for time protocols, focusing on the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This document also discusses the security impacts of time protocol practices, the performance implications of external security practices on time protocols, and the dependencies between other security services and time synchronization. </description>
