        <title>RFC 4177: Architectural Approaches to Multi-homing for IPv6, G. Huston</title>
        <dc:date>2005-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo provides an analysis of the architectural aspects of multi-homing support for the IPv6 protocol suite.  The purpose of this analysis is to provide a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches to multi-homing.  It is also an objective of this exercise to identify common aspects of this domain of study, and also to provide a framework that can allow exploration of some of the further implications of various architectural extensions that are intended to support multi-homing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
