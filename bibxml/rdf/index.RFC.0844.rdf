        <title>RFC 0844: Who talks ICMP, too? - Survey of 18 February 1983, R. Clements</title>
        <dc:date>1983-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET    connections from a user at a class C site.  This requires, in    addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and    handling of Class C addresses.  The list of hosts was taken from RFC    843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting    TELNET connection.  The tests were run on 18-Feb-83. </description>
