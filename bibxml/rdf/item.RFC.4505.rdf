        <title>RFC 4505: Anonymous Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism, K. Zeilenga</title>
        <dc:date>2006-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
