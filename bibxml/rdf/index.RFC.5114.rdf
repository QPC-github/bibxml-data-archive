        <title>RFC 5114: Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards, M. Lepinski, S. Kent</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>These groups and the associated test data are defined by NIST on their web site [EX80056A], but have not yet (as of this writing) been published in a formal NIST document.  Publication of these groups and associated test data, as well as describing how to use Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key agreement in all of the protocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate development of interoperable implementations and support the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validation of implementations that make use of these groups.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
