        <title>RFC 4218: Threats Relating to IPv6 Multihoming Solutions, E. Nordmark, T. Li</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions might make the Internet less secure; we examine threats that are inherent to all IPv6 multihoming solutions rather than study any specific proposed solution.  The threats in this document build upon the threats discovered and discussed as part of the Mobile IPv6 work.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
