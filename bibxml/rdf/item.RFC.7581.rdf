        <title>RFC 7581: Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information Encoding for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks, G. Bernstein, Y. Lee, D. Li, W. Imajuku, J. Han</title>

        <description>This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the WSON-specific information fields.  It is intended that protocol- specific documents will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses.  Such encodings can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.  In addition, these encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same information to a Path Computation Element (PCE). </description>
