        <title>RFC 5901: Extensions to the IODEF-Document Class for Reporting Phishing, P. Cain, D. Jevans</title>
        <dc:date>2010-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 to support the reporting of phishing events, which is a particular type of fraud.  These extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle -- from receipt of the phishing lure to the disablement of the collection site.  Both simple reporting and complete forensic reporting are possible, as is consolidating multiple incidents.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
