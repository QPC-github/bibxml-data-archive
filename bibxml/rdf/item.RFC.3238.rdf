        <title>RFC 3238: IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services, S. Floyd, L. Daigle</title>
        <dc:date>2002-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document includes comments and recommendations by the IAB on some architectural and policy issues related to the chartering of Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) in the IETF.  OPES are services that would be deployed at application-level intermediaries in the network, for example, at a web proxy cache between the origin server and the client.  These intermediaries would transform or filter content, with the explicit consent of either the content provider or the end user. This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
