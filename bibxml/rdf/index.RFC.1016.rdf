        <title>RFC 1016: Something a Host Could Do with Source Quench: The Source Quench Introduced Delay (SQuID), W. Prue, J. Postel</title>
        <dc:date>1987-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The memo is intended to explore the issue of what a host could do with a source quench.  The proposal is for each source host IP module to introduce some delay between datagrams sent to the same destination host.  This is a "crazy idea paper" and discussion is essential. </description>
