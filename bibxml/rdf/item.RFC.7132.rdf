        <title>RFC 7132: Threat Model for BGP Path Security, S. Kent, A. Chi</title>
        <dc:date>2014-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The document characterizes classes of potential adversaries that are considered to be threats and examines classes of attacks that might be launched against PATHSEC.  It does not revisit attacks against unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been addressed in the BGP-4 standard.  It concludes with a brief discussion of residual vulnerabilities. </description>
