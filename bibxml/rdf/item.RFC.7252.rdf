        <title>RFC 7252: The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Z. Shelby, K. Hartke, C. Bormann</title>
        <dc:date>2014-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types.  CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments. </description>
