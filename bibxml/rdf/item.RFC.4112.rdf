        <title>RFC 4112: Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) Version 2 Specification, D. Eastlake 3rd</title>
        <dc:date>2005-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Electronic commerce frequently requires a substantial exchange of information in order to complete a purchase or other transaction, especially the first time the parties communicate.  A standard set of hierarchically-organized payment-related information field names in an XML syntax is defined so that this task can be more easily automated.  This is the second version of an Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) and is intended to meet the requirements of RFC 3505.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
