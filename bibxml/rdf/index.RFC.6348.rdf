        <description>This work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working group, but that solution did not closely follow the requirements documented here.  This document is published as a historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the protocol work.  This document defines a Historic Document for the  Internet community. </description>
