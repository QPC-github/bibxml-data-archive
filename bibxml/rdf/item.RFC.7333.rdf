        <title>RFC 7333: Requirements for Distributed Mobility Management, H. Chan, D. Liu, P. Seite, H. Yokota, J. Korhonen</title>
        <dc:date>2014-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) at the network layer.  The hierarchical structure in traditional wireless networks has led primarily to centrally deployed mobility anchors.  As some wireless networks are evolving away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to have a distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not need to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal route.  The motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement are also described. </description>
