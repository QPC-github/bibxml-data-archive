        <title>RFC 0970: On Packet Switches With Infinite Storage, J. Nagle</title>
        <dc:date>1985-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem    in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work    on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this    memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.    Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however,    still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an    infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that    shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out    queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime    will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of    congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to    switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this    document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time. </description>
