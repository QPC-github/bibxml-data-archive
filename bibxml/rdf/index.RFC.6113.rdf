        <title>RFC 6113: A Generalized Framework for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, S. Hartman, L. Zhu</title>

        <description>This document also provides common tools needed by multiple pre-authentication mechanisms.  One of these tools is a secure channel between the client and the key distribution center with a reply key strengthening mechanism; this secure channel can be used to protect the authentication exchange and thus eliminate offline dictionary attacks.  With these tools, it is relatively straightforward to chain multiple authentication mechanisms, utilize a different key management system, or support a new key agreement algorithm.
