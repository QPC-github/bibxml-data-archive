        <title>RFC 6163: Framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element (PCE) Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs), Y. Lee, G. Bernstein, W. Imajuku</title>
        <dc:date>2011-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common across different WSON environments; as such, it does not address optical impairments in any depth. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
