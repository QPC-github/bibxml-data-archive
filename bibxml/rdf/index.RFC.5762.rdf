        <title>RFC 5762: RTP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), C. Perkins</title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport for real-time multimedia on IP networks.  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport protocol that provides desirable services for real-time applications.  This memo specifies a mapping of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated signalling, such that real- time applications can make use of the services provided by DCCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
