        <title>RFC 5062: Security Attacks Found Against the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and Current Countermeasures, R. Stewart, M. Tuexen, G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2007-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes certain security threats to SCTP.  It also describes ways to mitigate these threats, in particular by using techniques from the SCTP Specification Errata and Issues memo (RFC 4460).  These techniques are included in RFC 4960, which obsoletes RFC 2960.  It is hoped that this information will provide some useful background information for many of the newest requirements spelled out in the SCTP Specification Errata and Issues and included in RFC 4960.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
