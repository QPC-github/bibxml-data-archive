        <title>RFC 7260: GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Configuration, A. Takacs, D. Fedyk, J. He</title>
        <dc:date>2014-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is an integral part of transport connections; hence, it is required that OAM functions be activated/deactivated in sync with connection commissioning/ decommissioning, in order to avoid spurious alarms and ensure consistent operation.  In certain technologies, OAM entities are inherently established once the connection is set up, while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and configure OAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support the establishment and configuration of OAM entities along with Label Switched Path signaling. </description>
