        <title>RFC 5506: Support for Reduced-Size Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP): Opportunities and Consequences, I. Johansson, M. Westerlund</title>
        <dc:date>2009-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses benefits and issues that arise when allowing Real-time Transport Protocol (RTCP) packets to be transmitted with reduced size.  The size can be reduced if the rules on how to create compound packets outlined in RFC 3550 are removed or changed.  Based on that analysis, this memo defines certain changes to the rules to allow feedback messages to be sent as Reduced-Size RTCP packets under certain conditions when using the RTP/AVPF (Real-time Transport Protocol / Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback) profile (RFC 4585). This document updates RFC 3550, RFC 3711, and RFC 4585.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
