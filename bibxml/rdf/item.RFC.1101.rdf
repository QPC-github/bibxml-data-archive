        <title>RFC 1101: DNS encoding of network names and other types, P.V. Mockapetris</title>
        <dc:date>1989-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposes two extensions to the Domain Name System:    - A specific method for entering and retrieving RRs which map      between network names and numbers.    - Ideas for a general method for describing mappings between      arbitrary identifiers and numbers. The method for mapping between network names and addresses is a proposed standard, the ideas for a general method are experimental. </description>
