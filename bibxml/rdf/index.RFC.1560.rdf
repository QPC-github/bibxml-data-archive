        <title>RFC 1560: The MultiProtocol Internet, B. Leiner, Y. Rekhter</title>
        <dc:date>1993-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There has recently been considerable discussion on two topics: MultiProtocol approaches in the Internet and the selection of a next generation Internet Protocol. This document suggests a strawman position for goals and approaches for the IETF/IESG/IAB in these areas. It takes the view that these two topics are related, and proposes directions for the IETF/IESG/IAB to pursue. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
