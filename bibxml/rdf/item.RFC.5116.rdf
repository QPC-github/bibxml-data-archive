        <title>RFC 5116: An Interface and Algorithms for Authenticated Encryption, D. McGrew</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines algorithms for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), and defines a uniform interface and a registry for such algorithms.  The interface and registry can be used as an application-independent set of cryptoalgorithm suites.  This approach provides advantages in efficiency and security, and promotes the reuse of crypto implementations.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
