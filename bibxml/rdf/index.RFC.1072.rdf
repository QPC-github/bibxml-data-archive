        <title>RFC 1072: TCP extensions for long-delay paths, V. Jacobson, R.T. Braden</title>
        <dc:date>1988-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposes a set of extensions to the TCP protocol to provide efficient operation over a path with a high bandwidth*delay product. These extensions are not proposed as an Internet standard at this time. Instead, they are intended as a basis for further experimentation and research on transport protocol performance. </description>
