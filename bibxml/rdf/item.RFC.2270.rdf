        <title>RFC 2270: Using a Dedicated AS for Sites  Homed to a Single Provider, J. Stewart, T. Bates, R. Chandra, E. Chen</title>
        <dc:date>1998-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers using BGP4 has grown significantly. RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when one needs and should use an AS. However, the customer and service provider (ISP) are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4 a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single ISP.  This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations set forth in RFC1930.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
