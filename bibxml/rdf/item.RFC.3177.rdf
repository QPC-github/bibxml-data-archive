        <title>RFC 3177: IAB/IESG Recommendations on IPv6 Address Allocations to Sites, , </title>
        <dc:date>2001-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides recommendations to the addressing registries (APNIC, ARIN and RIPE-NCC) on policies for assigning IPv6 address blocks to end sites.  In particular, it recommends the assignment of /48 in the general case, /64 when it is known that one and only one subnet is needed and /128 when it is absolutely known that one and only one device is connecting. </description>
