        <title>RFC 0988: Host extensions for IP multicasting, S.E. Deering</title>
        <dc:date>1986-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of    the Internet Protocol (IP) to support internetwork multicasting.  This    specification supersedes that given in RFC-966, and constitutes a    proposed protocol standard for IP multicasting in the ARPA-Internet.    The reader is directed to RFC-966 for a discussion of the motivation and    rationale behind the multicasting extension specified here. </description>
