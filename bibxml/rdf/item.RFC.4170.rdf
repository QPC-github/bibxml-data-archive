        <title>RFC 4170: Tunneling Multiplexed Compressed RTP (TCRTP), B. Thompson, T. Koren, D. Wing</title>
        <dc:date>2005-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth utilization of RTP streams over network paths that carry multiple Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams in parallel between two endpoints, as in voice trunking.  The method combines standard protocols that provide compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path for the purpose of reducing the bandwidth used when multiple RTP streams are carried over that path.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
