        <title>RFC 3532: Requirements for the Dynamic Partitioning of Switching Elements, T. Anderson, J. Buerkle</title>
        <dc:date>2003-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document identifies a set of requirements for the mechanisms used to dynamically reallocate the resources of a switching element (e.g., an ATM switch) to its partitions.  These requirements are particularly critical in the case of an operator creating a switch partition and then leasing control of that partition to a third party.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
