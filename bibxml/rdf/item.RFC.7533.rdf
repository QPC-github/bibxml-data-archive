        <title>RFC 7533: Administration Protocol for Federated File Systems, J. Lentini, R. Tewari, C. Lever</title>
        <dc:date>2015-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the administration protocol for a federated file system (FedFS) that enables file access and namespace traversal across collections of independently administered fileservers.  The protocol specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers with different administrators can form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of the file systems physically hosted on and exported by the constituent fileservers. </description>
