        <title>RFC 7798: RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), Y.-K. Wang, Y. Sanchez, T. Schierl, S. Wenger, M. M. Hannuksela</title>
        <dc:date>2016-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single stream as well as multiple RTP streams. When multiple RTP streams are used, a single transport or multiple transports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others. </description>
