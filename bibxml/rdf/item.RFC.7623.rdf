        <title>RFC 7623: Provider Backbone Bridging Combined with Ethernet VPN (PBB-EVPN), A. Sajassi, S. Salam, N. Bitar, A. Isaac, W. Henderickx</title>

        <description>This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC Advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone MAC (B-MAC) address, provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows, offer per-site policies, and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology changes.  The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN. </description>
