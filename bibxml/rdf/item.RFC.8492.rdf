        <title>RFC 8492: Secure Password Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS), D. Harkins</title>
        <dc:date>2019-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support certificateless, secure authentication using only a simple, low-entropy password.  The exchange is called "TLS-PWD".  The ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange protocol, named "dragonfly", that is resistant to offline dictionary attacks. </description>
