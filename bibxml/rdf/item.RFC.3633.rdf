        <title>RFC 3633: IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6, O. Troan, R. Droms</title>
        <dc:date>2003-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Prefix Delegation options provide a mechanism for automated delegation of IPv6 prefixes using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).  This mechanism is intended for delegating a long-lived prefix from a delegating router to a requesting router, across an administrative boundary, where the delegating router does not require knowledge about the topology of the links in the network to which the prefixes will be assigned. </description>
