        <title>RFC 8022: A YANG Data Model for Routing Management, L. Lhotka, A. Lindem</title>
        <dc:date>2016-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document contains a specification of three YANG modules and one submodule.  Together they form the core routing data model that serves as a framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG modules defining data models for control-plane protocols, route filters, and other functions.  The core routing data model provides common building blocks for such extensions -- routes, Routing Information Bases (RIBs), and control-plane protocols. </description>
