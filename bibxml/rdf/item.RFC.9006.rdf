        <title>RFC 9006: TCP Usage Guidance in the Internet of Things (IoT), C. Gomez, J. Crowcroft, M. Scharf</title>
        <dc:date>2021-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides guidance on how to implement and use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in Constrained-Node Networks (CNNs), which are a characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT). Such environments require a lightweight TCP implementation and may not make use of optional functionality. This document explains a number of known and deployed techniques to simplify a TCP stack as well as corresponding trade-offs. The objective is to help embedded developers with decisions on which TCP features to use. </description>
