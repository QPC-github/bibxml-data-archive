        <dc:date>2010-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to use information associated with a trust anchor public key when validating certification paths.  This information can be used to constrain the usage of a trust anchor. Typically, constraints are used to limit the certificate policies and names that can appear in certification paths validated using a trust anchor.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
