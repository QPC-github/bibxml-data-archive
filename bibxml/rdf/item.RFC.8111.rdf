        <title>RFC 8111: Locator/ID Separation Protocol Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), V. Fuller, D. Lewis, V. Ermagan, A. Jain, A. Smirnov</title>

        <description>This document describes the Locator/ID Separation Protocol Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), a hierarchical distributed database that embodies the delegation of authority to provide mappings from LISP Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It is a statically defined distribution of the EID namespace among a set of LISP-speaking servers called "DDT nodes".  Each DDT node is configured as "authoritative" for one or more EID-prefixes, along with the set of RLOCs for Map-Servers or "child" DDT nodes to which more-specific EID-prefixes are delegated. </description>
