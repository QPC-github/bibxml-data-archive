        <title>RFC 4410: Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP), M. Pullen, F. Zhao, D. Cohen</title>
        <dc:date>2006-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport protocol, intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort messages in an any-to-any multicast environment, where the best-effort traffic occurs in significantly greater volume than the reliable traffic and therefore can carry sequence numbers of reliable messages for loss detection.  SRMP is intended for use in a distributed simulation application environment, where only the latest value of reliable transmission for any particular data identifier requires delivery.  SRMP has two sublayers: a bundling sublayer handling message aggregation and congestion control, and a Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer. Selection between reliable and best-effort messages is performed by the application.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
