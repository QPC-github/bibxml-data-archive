        <title>RFC 8497: Marking SIP Messages to Be Logged, P. Dawes, C. Arunachalam</title>
        <dc:date>2018-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol that can be used to mark signaling as being of interest to logging.  Such marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and is not used in normal user agent signaling. Operators of all networks on the signaling path can agree to carry such marking end to end, including the originating and terminating SIP user agents, even if a session originates and terminates in different networks. </description>
