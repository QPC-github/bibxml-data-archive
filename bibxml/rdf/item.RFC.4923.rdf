        <title>RFC 4923: Quality of Service (QoS) Signaling in a Nested Virtual Private Network, F. Baker, P. Bose</title>
        <dc:date>2007-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Some networks require communication between an interior and exterior portion of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or through a concatenation of such networks resulting in a nested VPN, but have sensitivities about what information is communicated across the boundary, especially while providing quality of service to communications with different precedence.  This note seeks to outline the issues and the nature of the proposed solutions based on the framework for Integrated Services operation over Diffserv networks as described in RFC 2998.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
