        <title>RFC 0995: End System to Intermediate System Routing Exchange Protocol for use in conjunction with ISO 8473, </title>
        <dc:date>1986-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This Protocol is one of a set of International Standards produced to    facilitate the interconnection of open systems.  The set of standards    covers the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection.    This Protocol is positioned with respect to other related standards by    the layers defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection    (ISO 7498) and by the structure defined in the Internal Organization of the    Network Layer (DIS 8648).  In particular, it is a protocol of the Network    Layer.  This Protocol permits End Systems and Intermediate Systems to    exchange configuration and routing information to facilitate the operation    of the routing and relaying functions of the Network Layer. </description>
