        <title>RFC 3717: IP over Optical Networks: A Framework, B. Rajagopalan, J. Luciani, D. Awduche</title>

        <description>The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model of high-speed routers interconnected by optical core networks.  The architectural choices for the interaction between IP and optical network layers, specifically, the routing and signaling aspects, are maturing.  At the same time, a consensus has emerged in the industry on utilizing IP-based protocols for the optical control plane.  This document defines a framework for IP over Optical networks, considering both the IP-based control plane for optical networks as well as IP-optical network interactions (together referred to as "IP over optical networks").  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
