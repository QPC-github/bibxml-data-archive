        <title>RFC 8586: Loop Detection in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), S. Ludin, M. Nottingham, N. Sullivan</title>
        <dc:date>2019-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the CDN-Loop request header field for HTTP. CDN-Loop addresses an operational need that occurs when an HTTP request is intentionally forwarded between Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), but is then accidentally or maliciously re-routed back into the original CDN causing a non-terminating loop.  The new header field can be used to identify the error and terminate the loop. </description>
