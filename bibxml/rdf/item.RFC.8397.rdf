        <title>RFC 8397: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Multilevel Using Unique Nicknames, M. Zhang, D. Eastlake 3rd, R. Perlman, H. Zhai, D. Liu</title>

        <description>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) routing can be extended to support multiple levels by building on the multilevel feature of IS-IS routing.  Depending on how nicknames are managed, there are two primary alternatives to realize TRILL multilevel: the unique nickname approach and the aggregated nickname approach as discussed in RFC 8243.  This document specifies a unique nickname approach.  This approach gives unique nicknames to all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus. </description>
