        <title>RFC 7503: OSPFv3 Autoconfiguration, A. Lindem, J. Arkko</title>
        <dc:date>2015-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>OSPFv3 is a candidate for deployments in environments where autoconfiguration is a requirement.  One such environment is the IPv6 home network where users expect to simply plug in a router and have it automatically use OSPFv3 for intra-domain routing.  This document describes the necessary mechanisms for OSPFv3 to be self-configuring. This document updates RFC 5340 by relaxing the HelloInterval/ RouterDeadInterval checking during OSPFv3 adjacency formation and adding hysteresis to the update of self-originated Link State Advertisements (LSAs). </description>
