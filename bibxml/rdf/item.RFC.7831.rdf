        <title>RFC 7831: Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) Architecture, J. Howlett, S. Hartman, H. Tschofenig, J. Schaad</title>
        <dc:date>2016-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).  The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of Identity Providers, Relying Parties, and federations. </description>
