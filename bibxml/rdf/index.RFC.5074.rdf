        <title>RFC 5074: DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV), S. Weiler</title>
        <dc:date>2007-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is a mechanism for publishing DNS Security (DNSSEC) trust anchors outside of the DNS delegation chain. It allows validating resolvers to validate DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors either aren't signed or don't publish Delegation Signer (DS) records for their children.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
