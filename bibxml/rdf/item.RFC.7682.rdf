        <title>RFC 7682: Considerations for Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) and Routing Policy Configuration, D. McPherson, S. Amante, E. Osterweil, L. Blunk, D. Mitchell</title>

        <description>The purpose of this document is to catalog issues that influenced the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRRs) for inter-domain routing policy specification and application in the global routing system over the past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day. </description>
