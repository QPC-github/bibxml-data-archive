        <description>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions. Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information from SIP is conveyed from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third party, known as a collector.  A registration for the application/ vq-rtcpxr media type is also included.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
