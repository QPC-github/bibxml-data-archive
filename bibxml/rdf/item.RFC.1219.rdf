        <title>RFC 1219: On the assignment of subnet numbers, P.F. Tsuchiya</title>
        <dc:date>1991-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo suggests a new procedure for assigning subnet numbers.  Use of this assignment technique within a network would be a purely local matter, and would not effect other networks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
