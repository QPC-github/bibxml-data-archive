        <title>RFC 4543: The Use of Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) in IPsec ESP and AH, D. McGrew, J. Viega</title>
        <dc:date>2006-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) as a mechanism to provide data origin authentication, but not confidentiality, within the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH). GMAC is based on the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation, and can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.
