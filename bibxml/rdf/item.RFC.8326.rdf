        <title>RFC 8326: Graceful BGP Session Shutdown, P. Francois, B. Decraene, C. Pelsser, K. Patel, C. Filsfils</title>
        <dc:date>2018-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document standardizes a new well-known BGP community, GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN, to signal the graceful shutdown of paths.  This document also describes operational procedures that use this well-known community to reduce the amount of traffic lost when BGP peering sessions are about to be shut down deliberately, e.g., for planned maintenance. </description>
