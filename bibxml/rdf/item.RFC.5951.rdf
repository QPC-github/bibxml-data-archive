        <title>RFC 5951: Network Management Requirements for MPLS-based Transport Networks, K. Lam, S. Mansfield, E. Gray</title>
        <dc:date>2010-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the requirements for the management of equipment used in networks supporting an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  The requirements are defined for specification of network management aspects of protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute the building blocks out of which the MPLS Transport Profile is constructed.  That is, these requirements indicate what management capabilities need to be available in MPLS for use in managing the MPLS-TP.  This document is intended to identify essential network management capabilities, not to specify what functions any particular MPLS implementation supports.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
