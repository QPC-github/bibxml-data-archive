        <title>RFC 0916: Reliable Asynchronous Transfer Protocol (RATP), G.G. Finn</title>
        <dc:date>1984-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This paper    proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two programs to reliably    communicate over a communication link.  It ensures that the data entering    one end of the link if received arrives at the other end intact and    unaltered.  The protocol, named RATP, is designed to operate over a full    duplex point-to-point connection.  It contains some features which tailor    it to the RS-232 links now in common use. </description>
