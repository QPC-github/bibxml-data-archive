        <title>RFC 4057: IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios, J. Bound</title>
        <dc:date>2005-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment within enterprise networks.  It defines a small set of basic enterprise scenarios and includes pertinent questions to allow enterprise administrators to further refine their deployment scenarios. Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of coexistence with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in terms of basic network infrastructure requirements for IPv6 deployment.  The scenarios and requirements described in this document will be the basis for further analysis to determine what coexistence techniques and mechanisms are needed for enterprise IPv6 deployment.  The results of that analysis will be published in a separate document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
