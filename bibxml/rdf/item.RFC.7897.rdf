        <title>RFC 7897: Domain Subobjects for the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP), D. Dhody, U. Palle, R. Casellas</title>
        <dc:date>2016-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement.  In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS).  This document specifies a representation and encoding of a domain sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain to be used by Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute inter-domain constrained shortest paths across a predetermined sequence of domains.  This document also defines new subobjects to be used to encode domain identifiers. </description>
