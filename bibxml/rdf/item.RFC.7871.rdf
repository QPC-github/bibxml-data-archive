        <title>RFC 7871: Client Subnet in DNS Queries, C. Contavalli, W. van der Gaast, D. Lawrence, W. Kumari</title>
        <dc:date>2016-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option that is in active use to carry information about the network that originated a DNS query and the network for which the subsequent response can be cached.  Since it has some known operational and privacy shortcomings, a revision will be worked through the IETF for improvement. </description>
