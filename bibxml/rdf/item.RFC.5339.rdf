        <title>RFC 5339: Evaluation of Existing GMPLS Protocols against Multi-Layer and Multi-Region Networks (MLN/MRN), JL. Le Roux, D. Papadimitriou</title>
        <dc:date>2008-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides an evaluation of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms against the requirements for Multi-Layer Networks (MLNs) and Multi-Region Networks (MRNs).  In addition, this document identifies areas where additional protocol extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy these requirements, and provides guidelines for potential extensions.  This memo  provides information for the Internet community. </description>
