        <title>RFC 5746: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Indication Extension, E. Rescorla, M. Ray, S. Dispensa, N. Oskov</title>

        <description>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which the attacker forms a TLS connection with the target server, injects content of his choice, and then splices in a new TLS connection from a client.  The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.  This specification defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tie renegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over, thus preventing this attack.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
