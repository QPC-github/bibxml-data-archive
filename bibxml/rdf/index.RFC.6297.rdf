        <title>RFC 6297: A Survey of Lower-than-Best-Effort Transport Protocols, M. Welzl, D. Ros</title>
        <dc:date>2011-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used for delay-insensitive "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a "less than" (or "lower than") best-effort service.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published  for informational purposes. </description>
