        <title>RFC 7648: Port Control Protocol (PCP) Proxy Function, S. Perreault, M. Boucadair, R. Penno, D. Wing, S. Cheshire</title>
        <dc:date>2015-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a new Port Control Protocol (PCP) functional element: the PCP proxy.  The PCP proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients to upstream PCP server(s).  A typical deployment usage of this function is to help establish successful PCP communications for PCP clients that cannot be configured with the address of a PCP server located more than one hop away. </description>
