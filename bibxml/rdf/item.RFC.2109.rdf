        <title>RFC 2109: HTTP State Management Mechanism, D. Kristol, L. Montulli</title>
        <dc:date>1997-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set- Cookie, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
