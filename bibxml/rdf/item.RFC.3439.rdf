        <title>RFC 3439: Some Internet Architectural Guidelines and Philosophy, R. Bush, D. Meyer</title>
        <dc:date>2002-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document extends RFC 1958 by outlining some of the philosophical guidelines to which architects and designers of Internet backbone networks should adhere.  We describe the Simplicity Principle, which states that complexity is the primary mechanism that impedes efficient scaling, and discuss its implications on the architecture, design and engineering issues found in large scale Internet backbones.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
