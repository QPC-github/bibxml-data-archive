        <title>RFC 3269: Author Guidelines for Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Building Blocks and Protocol Instantiation documents, R. Kermode, L. Vicisano</title>
        <dc:date>2002-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides general guidelines to assist the authors of Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building block and protocol instantiation definitions.  The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that any building block and protocol instantiation definitions produced contain sufficient information to fully explain their operation and use. In addition these guidelines provide directions to specify modular and clearly defined RMT building blocks and protocol instantiations that can be refined and augmented to safely create new protocols for use in new scenarios for which any existing protocols were not designed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
