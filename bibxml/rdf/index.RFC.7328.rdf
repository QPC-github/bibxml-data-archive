        <title>RFC 7328: Writing I-Ds and RFCs Using Pandoc and a Bit of XML, R. Gieben</title>
        <dc:date>2014-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The goal of this technique (which is called Pandoc2rfc) is to let an author of an I-D focus on the main body of text without being distracted too much by XML tags; however, it does not alleviate the need to typeset some files in XML. </description>
