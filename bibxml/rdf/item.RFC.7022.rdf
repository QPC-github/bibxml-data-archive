        <title>RFC 7022: Guidelines for Choosing RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Names (CNAMEs), A. Begen, C. Perkins, D. Wing, E. Rescorla</title>

        <description>For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the participants of an RTP session.  However, the existing guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard (RFC 3550) are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.  RFC 6222 was published to update those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique RTCP CNAMEs.  Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts of the new algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and/or ineffective.  This document addresses these concerns and replaces RFC 6222. </description>
