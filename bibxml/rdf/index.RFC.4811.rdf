        <title>RFC 4811: OSPF Out-of-Band Link State Database (LSDB) Resynchronization, L. Nguyen, A. Roy, A. Zinin</title>
        <dc:date>2007-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism to perform such a form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.  The mechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence.  It is implemented/supported by at least one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field.  The purpose of this document is to capture the details of this mechanism for public use.  This mechanism is not an IETF standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
