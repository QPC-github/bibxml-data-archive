        <description>The Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), as described in RFC 2516, mandates a maximum negotiated Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) of 1492.  This document outlines a solution that relaxes this restriction and allows a maximum negotiated MRU greater than 1492 to minimize fragmentation in next-generation broadband networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
