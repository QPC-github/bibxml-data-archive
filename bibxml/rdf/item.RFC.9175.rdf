        <title>RFC 9175: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): Echo, Request-Tag, and Token Processing, C. Amsüss, J. Preuß Mattsson, G. Selander</title>
        <dc:date>2022-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies enhancements to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that mitigate security issues in particular use cases. The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its claimed network address. The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server to match block-wise message fragments belonging to the same request. This document updates RFC 7252 with respect to the following: processing requirements for client Tokens, forbidding non-secure reuse of Tokens to ensure response-to-request binding when CoAP is used with a security protocol, and amplification mitigation (where the use of the Echo option is now recommended). </description>
