        <title>RFC 8157: Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding Protocol, N. Leymann, C. Heidemann, M. Zhang, B. Sarikaya, M. Cullen</title>

        <description>In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding is specified as an enabling approach for bonded access to a wired and a wireless network in customer premises, e.g., homes.  In GRE Tunnel Bonding, two GRE tunnels, one per network connection, are set up and bonded together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with each subconnection, the bonded connections promise increased access capacity and improved reliability.  The solution described in this document is currently implemented by Huawei and deployed by Deutsche Telekom AG.  This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations. </description>
