        <title>RFC 0949: FTP unique-named store command, M.A. Padlipsky</title>
        <dc:date>1985-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There are various contexts in which it would be desirable to have an FTP    command that had the effect of the present STOR but rather than    requiring the sender to specify a file name istead caused the resultant    file to have a unique name relative to the current directory.  This    RFC proposes an extension to the File Transfer Protocol for the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements.  See RFC-959. </description>
