        <title>RFC 8404: Effects of Pervasive Encryption on Operators, K. Moriarty, A. Morton</title>
        <dc:date>2018-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Pervasive monitoring attacks on the privacy of Internet users are of serious concern to both user and operator communities.  RFC 7258 discusses the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications and also recognizes that making networks unmanageable to mitigate pervasive monitoring is not an acceptable outcome: an appropriate balance is needed.  This document discusses current security and network operations as well as management practices that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol development in support of manageable and secure networks. </description>
