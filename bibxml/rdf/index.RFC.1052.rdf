        <dc:date>1988-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC is intended to convey to the Internet community and other interested parties the recommendations of the Internet Activities Board (IAB) for the development of network management protocols for use in the TCP/IP environment.  This memo does NOT, in and of itself, define or propose an Official Internet Protocol.  It does reflect, however, the policy of the IAB with respect to further network management development in the short and long term. </description>
