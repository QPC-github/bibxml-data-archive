        <title>RFC 6105: IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard, E. Levy-Abegnoli, G. Van de Velde, C. Popoviciu, J. Mohacsi</title>

        <description>Routed protocols are often susceptible to spoof attacks.  The canonical solution for IPv6 is Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), a solution that is non-trivial to deploy.  This document proposes a light-weight alternative and complement to SEND based on filtering in the layer-2 network fabric, using a variety of filtering criteria, including, for example, SEND status.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
