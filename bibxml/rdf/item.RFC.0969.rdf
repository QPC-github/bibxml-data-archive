        <title>RFC 0969: NETBLT: A bulk data transfer protocol, D.D. Clark, M.L. Lambert, L. Zhang</title>
        <dc:date>1985-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is a    preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.    NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data    between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow    controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide    variety of networks.  This description is published for discussion and    comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may    change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-998. </description>
