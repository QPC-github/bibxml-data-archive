        <title>RFC 0936: Another Internet subnet addressing scheme, M.J. Karels</title>
        <dc:date>1985-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a    single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical    networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest    of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view    of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of    this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and  type of    these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and    changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no    interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other    information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also    simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require    allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This    proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at    the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC    suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
