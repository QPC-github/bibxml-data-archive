        <title>RFC 5846: Binding Revocation for IPv6 Mobility, A. Muhanna, M. Khalil, S. Gundavelli, K. Chowdhury, P. Yegani</title>
        <dc:date>2010-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a binding revocation mechanism to terminate a mobile node's mobility session and the associated resources.  This mechanism can be used both with base Mobile IPv6 and its extensions, such as Proxy Mobile IPv6.  The mechanism allows the mobility entity which initiates the revocation procedure to request its peer to terminate either one, multiple or all specified Binding Cache entries.
