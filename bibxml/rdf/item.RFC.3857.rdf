        <title>RFC 3857: A Watcher Information Event Template-Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), J. Rosenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2004-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the watcher information template-package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework.  Watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event package.  Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are approved, or are rejected.  A user can subscribe to this information, and therefore learn about changes to it.  This event package is a template-package because it can be applied to any event package, including itself.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
