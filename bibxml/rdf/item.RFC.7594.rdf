        <description>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires a description of the logical architecture and standardisation of the key protocols that coordinate interactions between the components.  This document presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements.  It also defines terminology for LMAP (Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance). </description>
