        <title>RFC 4405: SMTP Service Extension for Indicating the Responsible Submitter of an E-Mail Message, E. Allman, H. Katz</title>
        <dc:date>2006-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service that allows an SMTP client to specify the responsible submitter of an e-mail message.  The responsible submitter is the e-mail address of the entity most recently responsible for introducing a message into the transport stream. This extension helps receiving e-mail servers efficiently determine whether the SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf of the responsible submitter's domain.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
