        <title>RFC 4620: IPv6 Node Information Queries, M. Crawford, B. Haberman</title>
        <dc:date>2006-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a protocol for asking an IPv6 node to supply certain network information, such as its hostname or fully-qualified domain name.  IPv6 implementation experience has shown that direct queries for a hostname are useful, and a direct query mechanism for other information has been found useful in serverless environments and for debugging.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
