        <title>RFC 6666: A Discard Prefix for IPv6, N. Hilliard, D. Freedman</title>
        <dc:date>2012-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of mitigating the effects of denial-of-service attacks by selectively discarding traffic based on source or destination address.  Remote triggered black hole routing describes a method of selectively re- routing traffic into a sinkhole router (for further analysis) based on destination address.  This document updates the "IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry" by explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix should be formally assigned by IANA for the purpose of facilitating IPv6 remote triggered black hole filtering and routing.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
