        <title>RFC 4489: A Method for Generating Link-Scoped IPv6 Multicast Addresses, J-S. Park, M-K. Shin, H-J. Kim</title>
        <dc:date>2006-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows the use of Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.  When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node can generate its unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  The alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses proposed in this document is better than known methods like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses.  This memo updates RFC 3306.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
