        <title>RFC 8777: DNS Reverse IP Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT) Discovery, J. Holland</title>
        <dc:date>2020-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates RFC 7450, "Automatic Multicast Tunneling" (or AMT), by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource record named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other extensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also defined. </description>
