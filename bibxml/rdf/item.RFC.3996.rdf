        <description>This document describes an extension to the Internet Printing Protocol1.1: Model and Semantics (RFC 2911, RFC 2910).  This document specifies the 'ippget' Pull Delivery Method for use with the "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions" specification (RFC 3995).  This IPPGET Delivery Method is REQUIRED for all clients and Printers that support RFC 3995.
