        <title>RFC 7085: Top-Level Domains That Are Already Dotless, J. Levine, P. Hoffman</title>
        <dc:date>2013-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability Advisory Committee have focused on the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains (TLDs) that contain address records (so-called "dotless domains").  In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with dotless domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs and gives a script for finding them.  This document lists data about dotless TLDs but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others. </description>
