        <title>RFC 4594: Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes, J. Babiarz, K. Chan, F. Baker</title>
        <dc:date>2006-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv and recommends how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class, but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply them consistently.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
