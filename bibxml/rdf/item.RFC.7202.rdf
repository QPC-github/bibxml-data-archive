        <title>RFC 7202: Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution, C. Perkins, M. Westerlund</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses the problem of securing real-time multimedia sessions.  It also explains why the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) and the associated RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) do not mandate a single media security mechanism.  This is relevant for designers and reviewers of future RTP extensions to ensure that appropriate security mechanisms are mandated and that any such mechanisms are specified in a manner that conforms with the RTP architecture. </description>
