        <title>RFC 7501: Terminology for Benchmarking Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Devices: Basic Session Setup and Registration, C. Davids, V. Gurbani, S. Poretsky</title>
        <dc:date>2015-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document (RFC 7502).  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars, and Session Border Controllers.  The term "performance" in this context means the capacity of the Device Under Test (DUT) to process SIP messages. Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configurations and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definitions and were obtained following the same procedures. </description>
