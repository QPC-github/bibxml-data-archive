        <title>RFC 7509: RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) for Post-Repair Loss Count Metrics, R. Huang, V. Singh</title>
        <dc:date>2015-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) block that allows reporting of a post-repair loss count metric for a range of RTP applications.  In addition, another metric, repaired loss count, is also introduced in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count when needed, so that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate the effectiveness of the repair methods used by the system. </description>
