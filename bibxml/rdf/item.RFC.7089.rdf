        <title>RFC 7089: HTTP Framework for Time-Based Access to Resource States -- Memento, H. Van de Sompel, M. Nelson, R. Sanderson</title>
        <dc:date>2013-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web.  It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource. </description>
