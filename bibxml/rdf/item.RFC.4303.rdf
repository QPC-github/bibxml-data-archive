        <title>RFC 4303: IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), S. Kent</title>
        <dc:date>2005-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an updated version of the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol, which is designed to provide a mix of security services in IPv4 and IPv6.  ESP is used to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, connectionless integrity, an anti-replay service (a form of partial sequence integrity), and limited traffic flow confidentiality.  This document obsoletes RFC 2406 (November 1998).  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
