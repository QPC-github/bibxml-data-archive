        <title>RFC 6525: Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Stream Reconfiguration, R. Stewart, M. Tuexen, P. Lei</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) want the ability to "reset" a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can "reuse" streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero".  This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
