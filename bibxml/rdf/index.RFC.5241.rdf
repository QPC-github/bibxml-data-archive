        <dc:date>2008-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document proposes a new revenue source for the IETF to support standardization activities: protocol field naming rights, i.e., the association of commercial brands with protocol fields.  This memo describes a process for assignment of rights and explores some of the issues associated with the process.  Individuals or organizations that wish to purchase naming rights for one or more protocol fields are expected to follow this process.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
