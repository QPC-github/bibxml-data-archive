        <title>RFC 6223: Indication of Support for Keep-Alive, C. Holmberg</title>
        <dc:date>2011-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via header field parameter, "keep", which allows adjacent SIP entities to explicitly negotiate usage of the Network Address Translation (NAT) keep-alive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound, in cases where SIP Outbound is not supported, cannot be applied, or where usage of keep-alives is not implicitly negotiated as part of the SIP Outbound negotiation.
