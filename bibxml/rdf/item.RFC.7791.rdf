        <title>RFC 7791: Cloning the IKE Security Association in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2), D. Migault, V. Smyslov</title>
        <dc:date>2016-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The protocol described allows a peer to clone an IKEv2 SA, where an additional SA is derived from an existing one.  The newly created IKE SA is set without the IKEv2 authentication exchange.  This IKE SA can later be assigned to another interface or moved to another cluster node. </description>
