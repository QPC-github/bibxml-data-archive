        <dc:date>2000-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a widely-implemented URI scheme, as World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as television sets and television set-top boxes, which are capable of receiving television programming from either terrestrial broadcast, satellite broadcast, or cable.  In this context there is a need to reference television broadcasts using the URI format described in RFC 2396.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
