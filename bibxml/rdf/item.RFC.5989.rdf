        <title>RFC 5989: A SIP Event Package for Subscribing to Changes to an HTTP Resource, A.B. Roach</title>
        <dc:date>2010-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is increasingly being used in systems that are tightly coupled with Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) servers for a variety of reasons.  In many of these cases, applications can benefit from being able to discover, in near real- time, when a specific HTTP resource is created, changed, or deleted. This document proposes a mechanism, based on the SIP Event Framework, for doing so.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
