        <title>RFC 5150: Label Switched Path Stitching with Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (GMPLS TE), A. Ayyangar, K. Kompella, JP. Vasseur, A. Farrel</title>
        <dc:date>2008-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>It may be possible to configure a GMPLS node to switch the traffic from an LSP for which it is the egress, to another LSP for which it is the ingress, without requiring any signaling or routing extensions whatsoever and such that the operation is completely transparent to other nodes.  This will also result in LSP stitching in the data plane.  However, this document does not cover this scenario of LSP stitching.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
