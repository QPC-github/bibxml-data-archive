        <title>RFC 7846: Peer-to-Peer Streaming Tracker Protocol (PPSTP), R. Cruz, M. Nunes, J. Xia, R. Huang, J. Taveira, D. Lingli</title>

        <description>This document specifies the base Peer-to-Peer Streaming Tracker Protocol (PPSTP) version 1, an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers.  The specification outlines the architecture of the protocol and its functionality; it also describes message flows, message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax, and semantics.  The PPSTP enables cooperating peers to form content-streaming overlay networks to support near real-time delivery of structured media content (audio, video, and associated timed text and metadata), such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable), and multi-view (3D) videos in live, time-shifted, and on-demand modes. </description>
