        <title>RFC 3222: Terminology for Forwarding Information Base (FIB) based Router Performance, G. Trotter</title>
        <dc:date>2001-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the terms to be used in a methodology that determines the IP packet forwarding performance of IP routers as a function of the forwarding information base installed within a router. The forwarding performance of an IP router may be dependent upon or may be linked to the composition and size of the forwarding information base installed within a router.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
