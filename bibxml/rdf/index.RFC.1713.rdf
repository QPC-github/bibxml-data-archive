        <title>RFC 1713: Tools for DNS debugging, A. Romao</title>
        <dc:date>1994-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Although widely used (and most of the times unnoticed), DNS (Domain Name System) is too much overlooked, in the sense that people, especially administrators, tend to ignore possible anomalies as long as applications that need name-to-address mapping continue to work.  This document presents some tools available for domain administrators to detect and correct those anomalies. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
