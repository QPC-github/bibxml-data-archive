        <title>RFC 6820: Address Resolution Problems in Large Data Center Networks, T. Narten, M. Karir, I. Foo</title>
        <dc:date>2013-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document examines address resolution issues related to the scaling of data centers with a very large number of hosts.  The scope of this document is relatively narrow, focusing on address resolution (the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in IPv4 and Neighbor Discovery (ND) in IPv6) within a data center.  This document is a product of the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). </description>
