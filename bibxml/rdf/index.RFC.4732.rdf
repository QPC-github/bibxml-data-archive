        <title>RFC 4732: Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations, M. Handley, E. Rescorla, </title>
        <dc:date>2006-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides an overview of possible avenues for denial-of-service (DoS) attack on Internet systems.  The aim is to encourage protocol designers and network engineers towards designs that are more robust.  We discuss partial solutions that reduce the effectiveness of attacks, and how some solutions might inadvertently open up alternative vulnerabilities.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
