        <title>RFC 8585: Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers to Support IPv4-as-a-Service, J. Palet Martinez, H. M.-H. Liu, M. Kawashima</title>
        <dc:date>2019-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Specifically, this document extends the basic requirements for IPv6 CE routers as described in RFC 7084 to allow the provisioning of IPv6 transition services for the support of IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) by means of new transition mechanisms.  The document only covers IPv4aaS, i.e., transition technologies for delivering IPv4 in IPv6-only access networks.  IPv4aaS is necessary because there aren't sufficient IPv4 addresses available for every possible customer/ device.  However, devices or applications in the customer Local Area Networks (LANs) may be IPv4-only or IPv6-only and still need to communicate with IPv4-only services on the Internet. </description>
