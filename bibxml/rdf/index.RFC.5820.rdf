        <title>RFC 5820: Extensions to OSPF to Support Mobile Ad Hoc Networking, A. Roy, M. Chandra</title>
        <dc:date>2010-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay), include mechanisms for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes, and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates.  OSPF-OR also provides a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANETs.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
