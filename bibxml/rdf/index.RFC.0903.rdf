        <title>RFC 0903: A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol, R. Finlayson, T. Mann, J.C. Mogul, M. Theimer</title>
        <dc:date>1984-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a method for workstations to dynamically find their    protocol address (e.g., their Internet Address), when they know only    their hardware address (e.g., their attached physical network address).    This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community,    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
