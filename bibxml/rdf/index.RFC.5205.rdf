        <title>RFC 5205: Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Domain Name System (DNS) Extensions, P. Nikander, J. Laganier</title>
        <dc:date>2008-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a new resource record (RR) for the Domain Name System (DNS), and how to use it with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  This RR allows a HIP node to store in the DNS its Host Identity (HI, the public component of the node public-private key pair), Host Identity Tag (HIT, a truncated hash of its public key), and the Domain Names of its rendezvous servers (RVSs).  This memo defines an  Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
