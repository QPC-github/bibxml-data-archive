        <title>RFC 3528: Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol (mSLP), W. Zhao, H. Schulzrinne, E. Guttman</title>
        <dc:date>2003-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Mesh-enhanced Service Location Protocol (mSLP).  mSLP enhances the Service Location Protocol (SLP) with a scope-based fully-meshed peering Directory Agent (DA) architecture. Peer DAs exchange new service registrations in shared scopes via anti- entropy and direct forwarding.  mSLP improves the reliability and consistency of SLP DA services, and simplifies Service Agent (SA) registrations in systems with multiple DAs.  mSLP is backward compatible with SLPv2 and can be deployed incrementally.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
