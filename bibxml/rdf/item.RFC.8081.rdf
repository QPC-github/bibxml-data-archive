        <title>RFC 8081: The "font" Top-Level Media Type, C. Lilley</title>
        <dc:date>2017-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered.  This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations. </description>
