        <title>RFC 8435: Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible File Layout, B. Halevy, T. Haynes</title>
        <dc:date>2018-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The flexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS that allows the use of storage devices that require only a limited degree of interaction with the metadata server and use already-existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring is also added to provide replication of files. </description>
