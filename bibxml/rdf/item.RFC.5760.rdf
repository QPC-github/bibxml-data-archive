        <title>RFC 5760: RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback, J. Ott, J. Chesterfield, E. Schooler</title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback to a multicast sender.  The proposed extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional model of many-to-many group communication is either not available or not desired.  In addition, it can be applied to any group that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized reporting mechanism.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
