        <title>RFC 7710: Captive-Portal Identification Using DHCP or Router Advertisements (RAs), W. Kumari, O. Gudmundsson, P. Ebersman, S. Sheng</title>
        <dc:date>2015-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal device and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be used in larger solutions.  The method of authenticating to and interacting with the captive portal is out of scope for this document. </description>
