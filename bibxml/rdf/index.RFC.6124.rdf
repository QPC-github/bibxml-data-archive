        <title>RFC 6124: An EAP Authentication Method Based on the Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) Protocol, Y. Sheffer, G. Zorn, H. Tschofenig, S. Fluhrer</title>

        <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) describes a framework that allows the use of multiple authentication mechanisms.  This document defines an authentication mechanism for EAP called EAP-EKE, based on the Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) protocol.  This method provides mutual authentication through the use of a short, easy to remember password.  Compared with other common authentication methods, EAP-EKE is not susceptible to dictionary attacks.  Neither does it require the availability of public-key certificates.   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
