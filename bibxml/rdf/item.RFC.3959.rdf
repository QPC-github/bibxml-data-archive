        <title>RFC 3959: The Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2004-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the Content-Disposition header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The treatment of "early-session" bodies is similar to the treatment of "session" bodies.  That is, they follow the offer/answer model.  Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is "early-session" are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialogs.
