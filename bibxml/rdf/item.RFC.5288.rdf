        <title>RFC 5288: AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM) Cipher Suites for TLS, J. Salowey, A. Choudhury, D. McGrew</title>
        <dc:date>2008-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated encryption operation.  GCM provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication, can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.  This memo defines TLS cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSA, and Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange mechanisms.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
