        <title>RFC 7391: Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Protocol Extensions, J. Hadi Salim</title>
        <dc:date>2014-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Experience in implementing and deploying the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture has demonstrated the need for a few small extensions both to ease programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some transactions.  The ForCES protocol is extended with a table range operation and a new extension for error handling.  This document updates the semantics in RFCs 5810 and 7121 to achieve that end goal. </description>
