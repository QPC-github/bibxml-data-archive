        <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, enables extensible network access authentication.  This document specifies the EAP key hierarchy and provides a framework for the transport and usage of keying material and parameters generated by EAP authentication algorithms, known as "methods".  It also provides a detailed system-level security analysis, describing the conditions under which the key management guidelines described in RFC 4962 can be satisfied.
