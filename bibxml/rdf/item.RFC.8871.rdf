        <title>RFC 8871: A Solution Framework for Private Media in Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC), P. Jones, D. Benham, C. Groves</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a solution framework for ensuring that media confidentiality and integrity are maintained end to end within the context of a switched conferencing environment where Media Distributors are not trusted with the end-to-end media encryption keys.  The solution builds upon existing security mechanisms defined for the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). </description>
