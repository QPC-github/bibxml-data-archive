        <title>RFC 3904: Evaluation of IPv6 Transition Mechanisms for Unmanaged Networks, C. Huitema, R. Austein, S. Satapati, R. van der Pol</title>
        <dc:date>2004-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document analyzes issues involved in the transition of "unmanaged networks" from IPv4 to IPv6.  Unmanaged networks typically correspond to home networks or small office networks.  A companion paper analyzes out the requirements for mechanisms needed in various transition scenarios of these networks to IPv6.  Starting from this analysis, we evaluate the suitability of mechanisms that have already been specified, proposed, or deployed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
