        <title>RFC 2169: A Trivial Convention for using HTTP in URN Resolution, R. Daniel</title>
        <dc:date>1997-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the "THTTP" resolution protocol - a trivial convention for encoding resolution service requests and responses as HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 requests and responses.  The primary goal of THTTP is to be simple to implement so that existing HTTP servers may easily add support for URN resolution. We expect that the databases used by early resolvers will be useful when more sophisticated resolution protocols are developed later. </description>
