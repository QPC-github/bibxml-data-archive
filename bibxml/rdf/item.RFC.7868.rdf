        <description>This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP).  EIGRP is a routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology.  The specific algorithm used is called "DUAL", a Diffusing Update Algorithm as referenced in "Loop-Free Routing Using Diffusing Computations" (Garcia-Luna-Aceves 1993).  The algorithm and procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI International. </description>
