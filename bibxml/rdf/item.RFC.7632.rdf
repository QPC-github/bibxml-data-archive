        <title>RFC 7632: Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use Cases, D. Waltermire, D. Harrington</title>
        <dc:date>2015-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo documents a sampling of use cases for securely aggregating configuration and operational data and evaluating that data to determine an organization's security posture.  From these operational use cases, we can derive common functional capabilities and requirements to guide development of vendor-neutral, interoperable standards for aggregating and evaluating data relevant to security posture. </description>
