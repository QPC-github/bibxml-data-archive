        <dc:date>2009-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes security guidelines for the softwire "Hubs and Spokes" and "Mesh" solutions.  Together with discussion of the softwire deployment scenarios, the vulnerability to security attacks is analyzed to provide security protection mechanisms such as authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to the softwire control and data packets.
