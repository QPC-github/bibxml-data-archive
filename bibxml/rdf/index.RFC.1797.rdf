        <title>RFC 1797: Class A Subnet Experiment, </title>
        <dc:date>1995-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There appears to be some interest in experimenting with subnetting the class A addresses. It is suggested that conducting an experiment now to identify and fix any software that does not properly handle subnetted class A addresses would be useful and important. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.  This does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
