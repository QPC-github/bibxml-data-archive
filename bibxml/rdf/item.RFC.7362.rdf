        <title>RFC 7362: Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for Media in Real-Time Communication, E. Ivov, H. Kaplan, D. Wing</title>
        <dc:date>2014-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Latching, which is one of the HNT components, has a number of security issues covered here.  Because of those, and unless all security considerations explained here are taken into account and solved, the IETF advises against use of the latching mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions, such as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol. </description>
