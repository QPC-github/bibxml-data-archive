        <title>RFC 3906: Calculating Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Routes Over Traffic Engineering Tunnels, N. Shen, H. Smit</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how conventional hop-by-hop link-state routing protocols interact with new Traffic Engineering capabilities to create Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) shortcuts.  In particular, this document describes how Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm can be adapted so that link-state IGPs will calculate IP routes to forward traffic over tunnels that are set up by Traffic Engineering.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
