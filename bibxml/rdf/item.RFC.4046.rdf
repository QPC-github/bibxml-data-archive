        <description>This document defines the common architecture for Multicast Security (MSEC) key management protocols to support a variety of application, transport, and network layer security protocols.  It also defines the group security association (GSA), and describes the key management protocols that help establish a GSA.  The framework and guidelines described in this document permit a modular and flexible design of group key management protocols for a variety of different settings that are specialized to applications needs.  MSEC key management protocols may be used to facilitate secure one-to-many, many-to-many, or one-to-one communication.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
