        <description>This RFC is a near-verbatim copy of a document, known as NADF-123, which has been produced by the North American Directory Forum (NADF). As a part of its charter, the NADF must reach agreement as to how entries are named in the public portions of the North American Directory. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
