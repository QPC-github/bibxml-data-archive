        <title>RFC 5089: IS-IS Protocol Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery, JL. Le Roux, JP. Vasseur, Y. Ikejiri, R. Zhang</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be used by the PCC for PCE selection. When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of using IGP flooding.  For that purpose, this document defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing domain.
