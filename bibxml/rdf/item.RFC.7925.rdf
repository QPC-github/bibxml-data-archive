        <title>RFC 7925: Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Profiles for the Internet of Things, H. Tschofenig, T. Fossati</title>
        <dc:date>2016-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications security for this data exchange thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.  The lack of communication security is a common vulnerability in IoT products that can easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely deployed Internet security protocols. </description>
