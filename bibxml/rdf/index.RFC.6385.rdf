        <title>RFC 6385: General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) Experiences, M. Barnes, A. Doria, H. Alvestrand, B. Carpenter</title>
        <dc:date>2011-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing reviews of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) since 2004.  This document discusses the experience and the lessons learned over the past 7 years of this process.  The review team initially reviewed the I-Ds before each of the IESG telechats.  Since late 2005, review team members have been assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call is necessary for the I-D.  The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the I-D is placed on an IESG telechat agenda. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
