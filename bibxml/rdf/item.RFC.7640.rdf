        <title>RFC 7640: Traffic Management Benchmarking, B. Constantine, R. Krishnan</title>
        <dc:date>2015-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This framework describes a practical methodology for benchmarking the traffic management capabilities of networking devices (i.e., policing, shaping, etc.).  The goals are to provide a repeatable test method that objectively compares performance of the device's traffic management capabilities and to specify the means to benchmark traffic management with representative application traffic. </description>
