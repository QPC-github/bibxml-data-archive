        <title>RFC 0852: ARPANET short blocking feature, A.G. Malis</title>
        <dc:date>1983-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC specifies the ARPANET Short Blocking Feature, which will    allow ARPANET  hosts to optionally shorten the IMP's host blocking    timer.  This Feature is a replacement of the ARPANET non-blocking    host interface, which was never implemented, and will be available to    hosts using either the 1822 or 1822L Host Access Protocol.  This RFC    is also being presented as a solicitation of comments on the Short    Blocking Feature, especially from host network software implementers    and maintainers. </description>
