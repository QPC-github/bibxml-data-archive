        <title>RFC 7610: DHCPv6-Shield: Protecting against Rogue DHCPv6 Servers, F. Gont, W. Liu, G. Van de Velde</title>
        <dc:date>2015-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected to a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  It is based on DHCPv6 packet filtering at the layer 2 device at which the packets are received.  A similar mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'); hence, it is desirable that similar functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.  This document specifies a Best Current Practice for the implementation of DHCPv6-Shield. </description>
