        <title>RFC 4098: Terminology for Benchmarking BGP Device Convergence in the Control Plane, H. Berkowitz, E. Davies, S. Hares, P. Krishnaswamy, M. Lepp</title>
        <dc:date>2005-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document establishes terminology to standardize the description of benchmarking methodology for measuring eBGP convergence in the control plane of a single BGP device.  Future documents will address iBGP convergence, the initiation of forwarding based on converged control plane information and multiple interacting BGP devices.This terminology is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6.  Illustrative examples of each version are included where relevant.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
