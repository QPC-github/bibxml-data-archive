        <title>RFC 6518: Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines, G. Lebovitz, M. Bhatia</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is one of a series concerned with defining a roadmap of protocol specification work for the use of modern cryptographic mechanisms and algorithms for message authentication in routing protocols.  In particular, it defines the framework for a key management protocol that may be used to create and manage session keys for message authentication and integrity.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
