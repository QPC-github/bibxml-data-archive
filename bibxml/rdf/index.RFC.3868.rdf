        <title>RFC 3868: Signalling Connection Control Part User Adaptation Layer (SUA), J. Loughney, G. Sidebottom, L. Coene, G. Verwimp, J. Keller, B. Bidulock</title>

        <description>This document defines a protocol for the transport of any Signalling Connection Control Part-User signalling over IP using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  The protocol is designed to be modular and symmetric, to allow it to work in diverse architectures, such as a Signalling Gateway to IP Signalling Endpoint architecture as well as a peer-to-peer IP Signalling Endpoint architecture.
