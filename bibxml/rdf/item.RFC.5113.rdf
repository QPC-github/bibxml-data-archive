        <description>When multiple access networks are available, users may have difficulty in selecting which network to connect to and how to authenticate with that network.  This document defines the network discovery and selection problem, dividing it into multiple sub- problems.  Some constraints on potential solutions are outlined, and the limitations of several solutions (including existing ones) are discussed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
