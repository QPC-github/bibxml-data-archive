        <title>RFC 5828: Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Ethernet Label Switching Architecture and Framework, D. Fedyk, L. Berger, L. Andersson</title>
        <dc:date>2010-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities of Ethernet switches and Ethernet forwarding models.  As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized- MPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity.   GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies.  Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document provides a framework for these extensions.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
