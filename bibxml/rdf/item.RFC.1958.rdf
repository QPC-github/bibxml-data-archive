        <title>RFC 1958: Architectural Principles of the Internet, B. Carpenter</title>
        <dc:date>1996-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture. This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended to be a formal or invariant reference model.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
