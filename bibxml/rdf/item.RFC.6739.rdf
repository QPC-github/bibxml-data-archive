        <title>RFC 6739: Synchronizing Service Boundaries and <mapping> Elements Based on the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol, H. Schulzrinne, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings between two nodes.  This mechanism is designed for the exchange of authoritative <mapping> elements between two entities.  Exchanging cached <mapping> elements, i.e., non-authoritative elements, is possible but not envisioned.  Even though the <mapping> element format is reused from the LoST specification, the mechanism in this document can be used without the LoST protocol.  This document defines  an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
