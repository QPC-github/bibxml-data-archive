        <title>RFC 7066: IPv6 for Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Cellular Hosts, J. Korhonen, J. Arkko, T. Savolainen, S. Krishnan</title>

        <description>As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet.  Standardization organizations have made the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost, and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS) networks (hereafter collectively referred to as Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks).  This document also lists specific IPv6 functionalities that need to be implemented in addition to what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node Requirements document (RFC 6434).  It also discusses some issues related to the use of these components when operating in these networks.  This document obsoletes RFC 3316. </description>
