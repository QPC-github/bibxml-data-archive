        <title>RFC 4807: IPsec Security Policy Database Configuration MIB, M. Baer, R. Charlet, W. Hardaker, R. Story, C. Wang</title>
        <dc:date>2007-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) Management Information Base (MIB) module for configuring the security policy database of a device implementing the IPsec protocol. The policy-based packet filtering and the corresponding execution of actions described in this document are of a more general nature than for IPsec configuration alone, such as for configuration of a firewall.  This MIB module is designed to be extensible with other enterprise or standards-based defined packet filters and actions.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
