        <title>RFC 6929: Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol Extensions, A. DeKok, A. Lior</title>
        <dc:date>2013-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) protocol is nearing exhaustion of its current 8-bit Attribute Type space.  In addition, experience shows a growing need for complex grouping, along with attributes that can carry more than 253 octets of data.  This document defines changes to RADIUS that address all of the above problems. </description>
