        <title>RFC 8270: Increase the Secure Shell Minimum Recommended Diffie-Hellman Modulus Size to 2048 Bits, L. Velvindron, M. Baushke</title>
        <dc:date>2017-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) transport-layer protocol specifies that servers and clients should support groups with a minimum modulus group size of 1024 bits. Recent security research has shown that the minimum value of 1024 bits is insufficient to protect against state-sponsored actors and any organization with enough computing resources.  This RFC updates RFC 4419, which allowed for DH moduli less than 2048 bits; now, 2048 bits is the minimum acceptable group size. </description>
