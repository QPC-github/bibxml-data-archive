        <title>RFC 5224: Diameter Policy Processing Application, M. Brenner</title>
        <dc:date>2008-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the need for a new IANA Diameter Command Code to be used in a vendor-specific new application for invocation of Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and Enforcement). This application is needed as one of the implementations of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management (PEEM) enabler, namely for the PEM-1 interface used to send a request/response for Policy Processing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
