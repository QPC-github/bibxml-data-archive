        <description>This memo defines a method with which HPR nodes can use IP networks for communication, and the enhancements to APPN required by this method. This memo also describes an option set that allows the use of the APPN connection network model to allow HPR nodes to use IP networks for communication without having to predefine link connections. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
