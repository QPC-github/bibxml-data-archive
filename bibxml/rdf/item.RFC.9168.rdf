        <title>RFC 9168: Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extension for Flow Specification, D. Dhody, A. Farrel, Z. Li</title>
        <dc:date>2022-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The extensions defined in this document include the creation, update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to the PCE by the Path Computation Client (PCC). Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request to indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this into the path computation. </description>
