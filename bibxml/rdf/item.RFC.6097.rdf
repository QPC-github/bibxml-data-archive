        <title>RFC 6097: Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) Discovery for Proxy Mobile IPv6, J. Korhonen, V. Devarapalli</title>
        <dc:date>2011-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Large Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments would benefit from a functionality where a Mobile Access Gateway could dynamically discover a Local Mobility Anchor for a Mobile Node attaching to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  The purpose of the dynamic discovery functionality is to reduce the amount of static configuration in the Mobile Access Gateway.  This document describes several possible dynamic Local Mobility Anchor discovery solutions.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
