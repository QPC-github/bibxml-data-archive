        <title>RFC 7748: Elliptic Curves for Security, A. Langley, M. Hamburg, S. Turner</title>
        <dc:date>2016-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer a high level of practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS).  These curves are intended to operate at the ~128-bit and ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based on a list of required properties. </description>
