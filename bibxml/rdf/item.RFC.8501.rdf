        <title>RFC 8501: Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service Providers, L. Howard</title>
        <dc:date>2018-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide IN-ADDR.ARPA information for their customers by prepopulating the zone with one PTR record for every available address.  This practice does not scale in IPv6.  This document analyzes different approaches and considerations for ISPs in managing the IP6.ARPA zone. </description>
