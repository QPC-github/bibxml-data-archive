        <title>RFC 7097: RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) for RLE of Discarded Packets, J. Ott, V. Singh, I. Curcio</title>
        <dc:date>2014-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real- time Transport Protocol (RTP) in order to provide a variety of short- term and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets discarded from the de- jitter buffer after successful reception. </description>
