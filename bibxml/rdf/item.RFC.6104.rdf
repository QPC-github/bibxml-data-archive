        <title>RFC 6104: Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisement Problem Statement, T. Chown, S. Venaas</title>
        <dc:date>2011-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey information to nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network.  This information includes the implied default router address taken from the observed source address of the RA message, as well as on-link prefix information.  However, unintended misconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network.  In this document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  We focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text.  The goal of this text is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions can be proposed and discussed.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
