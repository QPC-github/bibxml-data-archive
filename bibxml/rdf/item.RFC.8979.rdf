        <title>RFC 8979: Subscriber and Performance Policy Identifier Context Headers in the Network Service Header (NSH), B. Sarikaya, D. von Hugo, M. Boucadair</title>
        <dc:date>2021-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the Subscriber and Performance Policy Identifier Context Headers.  These Variable-Length Context Headers can be carried in the Network Service Header (NSH) and are used to inform Service Functions (SFs) of subscriber- and performance-related information for the sake of policy enforcement and appropriate Service Function Chaining (SFC) operations. The structure of each Context Header and their use and processing by NSH-aware nodes are described. </description>
