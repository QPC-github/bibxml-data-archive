        <title>RFC 8238: Data Center Benchmarking Terminology, L. Avramov, J. Rapp</title>
        <dc:date>2017-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purposes of this informational document are to establish definitions and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as to introduce new terminology applicable to performance evaluations of data center network equipment.  This document establishes the important concepts for benchmarking network switches and routers in the data center and is a prerequisite for the test methodology document (RFC 8239).  Many of these terms and methods may be applicable to network equipment beyond the scope of this document as the technologies originally applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere. </description>
