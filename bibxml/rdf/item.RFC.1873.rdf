        <title>RFC 1873: Message/External-Body Content-ID Access Type, E. Levinson</title>
        <dc:date>1995-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The existing MIME Content-Type Message/External-Body access-types allow a MIME entity (body-part) to refer to an object that is not in the message by specifying how to access that object.  The Content-ID access method described in this document provides the capability to refer to an object within the message.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
