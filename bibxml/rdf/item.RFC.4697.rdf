        <title>RFC 4697: Observed DNS Resolution Misbehavior, M. Larson, P. Barber</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes DNS iterative resolver behavior that results in a significant query volume sent to the root and top-level domain (TLD) name servers.  We offer implementation advice to iterative resolver developers to alleviate these unnecessary queries.  The recommendations made in this document are a direct byproduct of observation and analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen root name servers and all thirteen com/net TLD name servers.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
