        <title>RFC 4340: Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), E. Kohler, M. Handley, S. Floyd</title>
        <dc:date>2006-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport protocol that provides bidirectional unicast connections of congestion-controlled unreliable datagrams.  DCCP is suitable for applications that transfer fairly large amounts of data and that can benefit from control over the tradeoff between timeliness and reliability.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
