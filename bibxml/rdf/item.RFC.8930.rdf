        <title>RFC 8930: On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multi-Hop IPv6 Network, T. Watteyne, P. Thubert, C. Bormann</title>
        <dc:date>2020-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of an IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) fragment over a route-over network. Forwarding fragments can improve both end-to-end latency and reliability as well as reduce the buffer requirements in intermediate nodes; it may be implemented using RFC 4944 and Virtual Reassembly Buffers (VRBs). </description>
