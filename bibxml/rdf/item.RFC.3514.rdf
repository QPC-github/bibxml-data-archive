        <title>RFC 3514: The Security Flag in the IPv4 Header, S. Bellovin</title>
        <dc:date>2003-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Firewalls, packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and the like often have difficulty distinguishing between packets that have malicious intent and those that are merely unusual.  We define a security flag in the IPv4 header as a means of distinguishing the two cases.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
