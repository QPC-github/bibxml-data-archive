        <title>RFC 7960: Interoperability Issues between Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and Indirect Email Flows, F. Martin, E. Lear, T. Draegen, E. Zwicky, K. Andersen</title>

        <description>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and preferences for email message validation, disposition, and reporting.  However, the DMARC mechanism enables potentially disruptive interoperability issues when messages do not flow directly from the author's administrative domain to the final Recipients. Collectively, these email flows are referred to as "indirect email               flows".  This document describes these interoperability issues and presents possible methods for addressing them. </description>
