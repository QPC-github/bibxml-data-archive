        <title>RFC 4656: A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), S. Shalunov, B. Teitelbaum, A. Karp, J. Boote, M. Zekauskas</title>

        <description>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) measures unidirectional characteristics such as one-way delay and one-way loss.  High-precision measurement of these one-way IP performance metrics became possible with wider availability of good time sources (such as GPS and CDMA).  OWAMP enables the interoperability of these measurements.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
