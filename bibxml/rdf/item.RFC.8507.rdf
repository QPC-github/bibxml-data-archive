        <description>This document specifies a new version of IP called SIP, the Simple Internet Protocol.  It also describes the changes needed to ICMP, IGMP, and transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, in order to work with SIP.  A companion document [SIP-ADDR] describes the addressing and routing aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration, host and subnet mobility, and multicast. </description>
