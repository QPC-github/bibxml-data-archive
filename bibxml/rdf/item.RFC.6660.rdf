        <title>RFC 6660: Encoding Three Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) States in the IP Header Using a Single Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP), B. Briscoe, T. Moncaster, M. Menth</title>
        <dc:date>2012-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP header by reusing the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within a PCN-domain.  The PCN wire protocol for non-IP protocol headers will need to be defined elsewhere.  Nonetheless, this document clarifies the PCN encoding for MPLS in an informational appendix.  The encoding for IP provides for up to three different PCN marking states using a single Diffserv codepoint (DSCP): not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM), and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding.  This document obsoletes RFC 5696.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
