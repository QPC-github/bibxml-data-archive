        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource certificates completely obscure names or any other information that might be useful for contacting responsible parties to deal with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance, roll-overs, compromises, etc.  This document describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record containing human contact information that may be verified (indirectly) by a Certification Authority (CA) certificate.  The data in the record are those of a severely profiled vCard.  [STANDARDS- TRACK] </description>
