        <title>RFC 6034: Unicast-Prefix-Based IPv4 Multicast Addresses, D. Thaler</title>
        <dc:date>2010-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol.  The extension presented in this document allows for unicast-prefix-based assignment of multicast addresses.  By delegating multicast addresses at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators will be able to identify their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain allocation protocol.
