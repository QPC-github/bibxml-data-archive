        <title>RFC 4806: Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Extensions to IKEv2, M. Myers, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2007-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When certificates are used with IKEv2, the communicating peers need a mechanism to determine the revocation status of the peer's certificate.  OCSP is one such mechanism.  This document applies when OCSP is desired and security policy prevents one of the IKEv2 peers from accessing the relevant OCSP responder directly.  Firewalls are often deployed in a manner that prevents such access by IKEv2 peers outside of an enterprise network.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
