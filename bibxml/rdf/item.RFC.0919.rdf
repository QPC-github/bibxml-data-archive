        <title>RFC 0919: Broadcasting Internet Datagrams, J.C. Mogul</title>
        <dc:date>1984-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposes simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on    local networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and    for how gateways should handle them.  This RFC suggests a proposed    protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and    suggestions for improvements. </description>
