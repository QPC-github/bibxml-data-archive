        <title>RFC 8298: Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia, I. Johansson, Z. Sarker</title>
        <dc:date>2017-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational media services such as interactive video.  The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and uses a hybrid loss-and-delay- based congestion control algorithm.  The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios. </description>
