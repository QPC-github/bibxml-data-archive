        <title>RFC 2826: IAB Technical Comment on the Unique DNS Root, </title>
        <dc:date>2000-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses the existence of a globally unique public name space in the Internet called the DNS (Domain Name System).  This name space is a hierarchical name space derived from a single, globally unique root.  It is a technical constraint inherent in the design of the DNS.  One root must be supported by a set of coordinated root servers administered by a unique naming authority.  It is not technically feasible for there to be more than one root in the public DNS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
