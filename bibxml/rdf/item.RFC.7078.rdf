        <title>RFC 7078: Distributing Address Selection Policy Using DHCPv6, A. Matsumoto, T. Fujisaki, T. Chown</title>
        <dc:date>2014-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  RFC 6724 allows for the future definition of methods to administratively configure the address selection policy information.  This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus allowing the administrator to control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site. </description>
