        <description>This document defines a PHB (per-hop behavior) called Expedited Forwarding (EF).  The PHB is a basic building block in the Differentiated Services architecture.  EF is intended to provide a building block for low delay, low jitter and low loss services by ensuring that the EF aggregate is served at a certain configured rate. This document obsoletes RFC 2598.
