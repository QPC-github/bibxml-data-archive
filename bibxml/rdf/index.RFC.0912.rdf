        <title>RFC 0912: Authentication service, M. St. Johns</title>
        <dc:date>1984-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for verifying the    identity of a user of a TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number pair,    it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that    connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include automatic    identification and verification of a user during an FTP session,    additional verification of a TAC dial up user, and access verification    for a generalized network file server. </description>
