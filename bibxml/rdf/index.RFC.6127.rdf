        <title>RFC 6127: IPv4 Run-Out and IPv4-IPv6 Co-Existence Scenarios, J. Arkko, M. Townsley</title>
        <dc:date>2011-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document was originally created as input to the Montreal co- existence interim meeting in October 2008, which led to the rechartering of the Behave and Softwire working groups to take on new IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence work.  This document is published as a historical record of the thinking at the time, but hopefully will also help readers understand the rationale behind current IETF tools for co-existence and transition.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
