        <title>RFC 3425: Obsoleting IQUERY, D. Lawrence</title>
        <dc:date>2002-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IQUERY method of performing inverse DNS lookups, specified in RFC 1035, has not been generally implemented and has usually been operationally disabled where it has been implemented.  Both reflect a general view in the community that the concept was unwise and that the widely-used alternate approach of using pointer (PTR) queries and reverse-mapping records is preferable.  Consequently, this document deprecates the IQUERY operation, declaring it entirely obsolete.  This document updates RFC 1035.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
