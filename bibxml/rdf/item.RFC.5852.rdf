        <title>RFC 5852: RSVP-TE Signaling Extension for LSP Handover from the Management Plane to the Control Plane in a GMPLS-Enabled Transport Network, D. Caviglia, D. Ceccarelli, D. Bramanti, D. Li, S. Bardalai</title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes an extension to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling that enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management and the Control Planes.  Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover.  This document defines all Handover-related procedures.  This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state.  A basic premise of the extension is that the Handover procedures must never impact an already established Data Plane connection.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
