        <title>RFC 5858: IPsec Extensions to Support Robust Header Compression over IPsec, E. Ertekin, C. Christou, C. Bormann</title>

        <description>Integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) with IPsec (ROHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.  However, in order to integrate ROHC with IPsec, extensions to the Security Policy Database (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD) are required.  This document describes the IPsec extensions required to support ROHCoIPsec.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
