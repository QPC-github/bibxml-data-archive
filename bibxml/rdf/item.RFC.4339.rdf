        <title>RFC 4339: IPv6 Host Configuration of DNS Server Information Approaches, J. Jeong</title>
        <dc:date>2006-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes three approaches for IPv6 recursive DNS server address configuration.  It details the operational attributes of three solutions: RA option, DHCPv6 option, and well-known anycast addresses for recursive DNS servers.  Additionally, it suggests the deployment scenarios in four kinds of networks (ISP, enterprise, 3GPP, and unmanaged networks) considering multi-solution resolution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
