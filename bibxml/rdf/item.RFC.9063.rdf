        <title>RFC 9063: Host Identity Protocol Architecture, R. Moskowitz, M. Komu</title>
        <dc:date>2021-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility. The Security Considerations section also describes measures against flooding attacks, usage of identities in access control lists, weaker types of identifiers, and trust on first use. This document incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 7401 and goes further to explain how HIP works as a secure signaling channel. </description>
