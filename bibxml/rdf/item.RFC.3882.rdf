        <title>RFC 3882: Configuring BGP to Block Denial-of-Service Attacks, D. Turk</title>
        <dc:date>2004-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an operational technique that uses BGP communities to remotely trigger black-holing of a particular destination network to block denial-of-service attacks.  Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network.  The document also describes a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic into a sinkhole router for analysis.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
