        <description>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for document exchange, and Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) defines extensions to IODEF intended for the cooperative handling of security incidents within consortia of network operators and enterprises.  This document specifies a transport protocol for RID based upon the passing of RID messages over HTTP/TLS (Transport Layer Security).
