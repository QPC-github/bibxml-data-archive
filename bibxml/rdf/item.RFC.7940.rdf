        <title>RFC 7940: Representing Label Generation Rulesets Using XML, K. Davies, A. Freytag</title>
        <dc:date>2016-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a method of representing rules for validating identifier labels and alternate representations of those labels using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These policies, known as "Label                    Generation Rulesets" (LGRs), are used for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), for example.  The rulesets are used to implement and share that aspect of policy defining which labels and Unicode code points are permitted for registrations, which alternative code points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on labels containing those variants. </description>
