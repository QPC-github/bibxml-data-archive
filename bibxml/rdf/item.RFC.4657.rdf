        <title>RFC 4657: Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements, J. Ash, J.L. Le Roux</title>
        <dc:date>2006-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The PCE model is described in the "PCE Architecture" document and facilitates path computation requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to Path Computation Elements (PCEs).  This document specifies generic requirements for a communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs, and also between PCEs where cooperation between PCEs is desirable.  Subsequent documents will specify application-specific requirements for the PCE communication protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
