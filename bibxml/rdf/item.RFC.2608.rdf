        <title>RFC 2608: Service Location Protocol, Version 2, E. Guttman, C. Perkins, J. Veizades, M. Day</title>
        <dc:date>1999-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the discovery and selection of network services.  Using this protocol, computers using the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network based applications.  This is especially important as computers become more portable, and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system administration. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
