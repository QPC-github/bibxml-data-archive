        <dc:date>2004-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses a number of differences between the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol used to route IP traffic as described in RFC 1195 and the protocol as it is deployed today.  These differences are discussed as a service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol to route IP traffic.  A companion document describes the differences between the protocol described in ISO 10589 and current practice.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
