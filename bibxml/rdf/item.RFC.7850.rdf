        <title>RFC 7850: Registering Values of the SDP 'proto' Field for Transporting RTP Media over TCP under Various RTP Profiles, S. Nandakumar</title>
        <dc:date>2016-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification establishes a registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the transport methods.  This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', and 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'. </description>
