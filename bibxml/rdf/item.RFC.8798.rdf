        <title>RFC 8798: Additional Units for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML), C. Bormann</title>
        <dc:date>2020-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the indication of units for a quantity represented.  This short document registers a number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for units in SenML.  It also defines a registry for secondary units that cannot be in SenML's main registry, as they are derived by linear transformation from units already in that registry. </description>
