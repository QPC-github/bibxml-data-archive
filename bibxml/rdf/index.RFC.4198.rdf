        <title>RFC 4198: A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Federated Content, D. Tessman</title>
        <dc:date>2005-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace for identifying content resources within federated content collections. A federated content collection often does not have a strong centralized authority but relies upon shared naming, metadata, and access conventions to provide interoperability among its members.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
