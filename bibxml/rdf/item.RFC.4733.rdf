        <title>RFC 4733: RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals, H. Schulzrinne, T. Taylor</title>
        <dc:date>2006-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a number of clarifications to the original document.  However, it specifically differs from RFC 2833 by removing the requirement that all compliant implementations support the DTMF events.  Instead, compliant implementations taking part in out-of-band negotiations of media stream content indicate what events they support.  This memo adds three new procedures to the RFC 2833 framework: subdivision of long events into segments, reporting of multiple events in a single packet, and the concept and reporting of state events.
