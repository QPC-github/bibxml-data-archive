        <title>RFC 4290: Suggested Practices for Registration of Internationalized Domain Names (IDN), J. Klensin</title>
        <dc:date>2005-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document explores the issues in the registration of internationalized domain names (IDNs).  The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names.  To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations. This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
