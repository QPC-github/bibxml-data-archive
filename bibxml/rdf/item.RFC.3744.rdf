        <title>RFC 3744: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol, G. Clemm, J. Reschke, E. Sedlar, J. Whitehead</title>
        <dc:date>2004-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol.  This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal.  A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories.  Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
