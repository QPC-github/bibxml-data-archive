        <title>RFC 1030: On testing the NETBLT Protocol over divers networks, M.L. Lambert</title>
        <dc:date>1987-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the results gathered from testing NETBLT over three networks of different bandwidths and round-trip delays.  The results are not complete, but the information gathered so far has not been promising.  The NETBLT protocol is specified in RFC-998; this document assumes an understanding of the specification as described in RFC-998. </description>
