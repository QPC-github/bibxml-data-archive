        <title>RFC 5022: Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol, J. Van Dyke, E. Burger, A. Spitzer</title>
        <dc:date>2007-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) is a markup language used in conjunction with SIP to provide advanced conferencing and interactive voice response (IVR) functions.  MSCML presents an application-level control model, as opposed to device-level control models.  One use of this protocol is for communications between a conference focus and mixer in the IETF SIP Conferencing Framework.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
