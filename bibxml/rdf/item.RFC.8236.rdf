        <dc:date>2017-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling (J-PAKE) protocol.  This protocol allows the establishment of a secure end-to-end communication channel between two remote parties over an insecure network solely based on a shared password, without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or any trusted third party. </description>
