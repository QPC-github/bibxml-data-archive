        <title>RFC 7102: Terms Used in Routing for Low-Power and Lossy Networks, JP. Vasseur</title>
        <dc:date>2014-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a glossary of terminology used in routing requirements and solutions for networks referred to as Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  An LLN is typically composed of many embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources interconnected by a variety of links.  There is a wide scope of application areas for LLNs, including industrial monitoring, building automation (e.g., heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, access control, fire), connected home, health care, environmental monitoring, urban sensor networks, energy management, assets tracking, and refrigeration. </description>
