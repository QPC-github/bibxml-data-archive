        <title>RFC 5212: Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi-Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN), K. Shiomoto, D. Papadimitriou, JL. Le Roux, M. Vigoureux, D. Brungard</title>

        <description>In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is referred to in this document as a multi-region network (MRN).  When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either single or multiple regions, this document uses the term multi-layer network (MLN).  This document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements.  This memo  provides information for the Internet community. </description>
