        <title>RFC 3763: One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) Requirements, S. Shalunov, B. Teitelbaum</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision.  To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required.  This document specifies requirements for a one-way active measurement protocol (OWAMP) standard.  The protocol can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
