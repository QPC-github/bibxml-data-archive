        <title>RFC 3468: The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Working Group decision on MPLS signaling protocols, L. Andersson, G. Swallow</title>
        <dc:date>2003-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document documents the consensus reached by the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Working Group within the IETF to focus its efforts on "Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)-TE: Extensions to RSVP for Label- Switched Paths (LSP) Tunnels" (RFC 3209) as the MPLS signalling protocol for traffic engineering applications and to undertake no new efforts relating to "Constraint-Based LSP Setup using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)" (RFC 3212).  The recommendations of section 6 have been accepted by the IESG.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
