        <title>RFC 3927: Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses, S. Cheshire, B. Aboba, E. Guttman</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks).  This document does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
