        <title>RFC 6613: RADIUS over TCP, A. DeKok</title>
        <dc:date>2012-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol has, until now, required the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the underlying transport layer.  This document defines RADIUS over the Transmission Control Protocol (RADIUS/TCP), in order to address handling issues related to RADIUS over Transport Layer Security (RADIUS/TLS).  It permits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for RADIUS only when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides confidentiality and security.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
