        <title>RFC 2657: LDAPv2 Client vs. the Index Mesh, R. Hedberg</title>
        <dc:date>1999-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion on referral.  The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs to be handled in a special way.  This document defines one possible way of doing this.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
