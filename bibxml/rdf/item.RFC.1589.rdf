        <title>RFC 1589: A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping, D. Mills</title>
        <dc:date>1994-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memorandum describes an engineering model which implements a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators and phase-lock loops (PLL) often found in the engineering literature. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
