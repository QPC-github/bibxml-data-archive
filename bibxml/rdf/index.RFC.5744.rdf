        <description>This document specifies the procedures by which authors of RFC Independent Submission documents grant the community "incoming" rights for copying and using the text.  It also specifies the "outgoing" rights the community grants to readers and users of those documents, and it requests that the IETF Trust manage the outgoing rights to effect this result.
