        <description>This document outlines architectural guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these architectural components come together in the development of a Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  This document lists certain high-level design decisions that provide foundations for the design of the MPTCP protocol, based upon these architectural requirements.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
