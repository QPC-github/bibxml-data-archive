        <title>RFC 2356: Sun's SKIP Firewall Traversal for Mobile IP, G. Montenegro, V. Gupta</title>
        <dc:date>1998-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Mobile IP specification establishes the mechanisms that enable a mobile host to maintain and use the same IP address as it changes its point of attachment to the network.  The mechanisms described in this document allow a mobile node out on a public sector of the internet to negotiate access past a SKIP firewall, and construct a secure channel into its home network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
