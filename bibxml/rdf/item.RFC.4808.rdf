        <title>RFC 4808: Key Change Strategies for TCP-MD5, S. Bellovin</title>
        <dc:date>2007-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The TCP-MD5 option is most commonly used to secure BGP sessions between routers.  However, changing the long-term key is difficult, since the change needs to be synchronized between different organizations.  We describe single-ended strategies that will permit (mostly) unsynchronized key changes.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
