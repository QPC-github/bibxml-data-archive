        <title>RFC 5111: Experiment in Exploratory Group Formation within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), B. Aboba, L. Dondeti</title>
        <dc:date>2008-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an RFC 3933 experiment in the Working Group formation process, known as the Exploratory Group.  Exploratory Groups may be created as the first step toward Working Group formation, or as an intermediate step between a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session and Working Group creation.  Exploratory Groups are focused on completion of prerequisites for Working Group formation, and as a result they have a short life-time, with limited opportunities for milestone extension.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
