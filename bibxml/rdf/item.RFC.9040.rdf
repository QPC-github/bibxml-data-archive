        <title>RFC 9040: TCP Control Block Interdependence, J. Touch, M. Welzl, S. Islam</title>
        <dc:date>2021-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo provides guidance to TCP implementers that is intended to help improve connection convergence to steady-state operation without affecting interoperability. It updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of sharing TCP state, as typically represented in TCP Control Blocks, among similar concurrent or consecutive connections. </description>
