        <title>RFC 9133: Controlling Filtering Rules Using Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel, K. Nishizuka, M. Boucadair, T. Reddy.K, T. Nagata</title>

        <description>Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or deactivate existing filtering rules during a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. The characterization of these filtering rules is conveyed by a DOTS client during an 'idle' time (i.e., no mitigation is active) by means of the DOTS data channel protocol. </description>
