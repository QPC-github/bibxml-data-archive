        <title>RFC 3701: 6bone (IPv6 Testing Address Allocation) Phaseout, R. Fink, R. Hinden</title>
        <dc:date>2004-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The 6bone was established in 1996 by the IETF as an IPv6 Testbed network to enable various IPv6 testing as well as to assist in the transitioning of IPv6 into the Internet.  It operates under the IPv6 address allocation 3FFE::/16 from RFC 2471.  As IPv6 is beginning its production deployment it is appropriate to plan for the phaseout of the 6bone.  This document establishes a plan for a multi-year phaseout of the 6bone and its address allocation on the assumption that the IETF is the appropriate place to determine this.  This document obsoletes RFC 2471, "IPv6 Testing Address Allocation", December, 1998.  RFC 2471 will become historic.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
