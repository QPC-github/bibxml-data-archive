        <title>RFC 5869: HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF), H. Krawczyk, P. Eronen</title>
        <dc:date>2010-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a simple Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)-based key derivation function (HKDF), which can be used as a building block in various protocols and applications.  The key derivation function (KDF) is intended to support a wide range of applications and requirements, and is conservative in its use of cryptographic hash functions.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes. </description>
