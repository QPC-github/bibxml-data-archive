        <title>RFC 2178: OSPF Version 2, J. Moy</title>
        <dc:date>1997-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.  OSPF provides support for equal-cost multipath.  An area routing capability is provided, enabling an additional level of routing protection and a reduction in routing protocol traffic.  In addition, all OSPF routing protocol exchanges are authenticated.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
