        <title>RFC 1003: Issues in defining an equations representation standard, A.R. Katz</title>
        <dc:date>1987-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo is intended to identify and explore issues in defining a standard for the exchange of mathematical equations.  No attempt is made at a complete definition and more questions are asked than are answered. Questions about the user interface are only addressed to the extent that they affect interchange issues. </description>
