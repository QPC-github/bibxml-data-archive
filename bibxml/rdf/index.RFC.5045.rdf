        <title>RFC 5045: Applicability of Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMA) and Direct Data Placement (DDP), C. Bestler, L. Coene</title>
        <dc:date>2007-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the applicability of Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP) and the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP). It compares and contrasts the different transport options over IP that DDP can use, provides guidance to ULP developers on choosing between available transports and/or how to be indifferent to the specific transport layer used, compares use of DDP with direct use of the supporting transports, and compares DDP over IP transports with non-IP transports that support RDMA functionality.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
