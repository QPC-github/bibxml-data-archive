        <title>RFC 3624: The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Bulk Audit Package, B. Foster, D. Auerbach, F. Andreasen</title>
        <dc:date>2003-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The base Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) includes audit commands that only allow a Call Agent to audit endpoint and/or connection state one endpoint at a time.  This document describes a new MGCP package for bulk auditing of a group of gateway endpoints.  It allows a Call Agent to determine the endpoint naming convention, the list of instantiated endpoints as well connection and endpoint state for the group of endpoints. </description>
