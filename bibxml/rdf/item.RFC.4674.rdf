        <title>RFC 4674: Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery, J.L. Le Roux</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document presents a set of requirements for a Path Computation Element (PCE) discovery mechanism that would allow a Path Computation Client (PCC) to discover dynamically and automatically a set of PCEs along with certain information relevant for PCE selection.  It is intended that solutions that specify procedures and protocols or extensions to existing protocols for such PCE discovery satisfy these requirements.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
