        <title>RFC 8888: RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Feedback for Congestion Control, Z. Sarker, C. Perkins, V. Singh, M. Ramalho</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine-grained feedback on packet loss, timing, and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marks than is provided by the standard RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets. This document describes an RTCP feedback message intended to enable congestion control for interactive real-time traffic using RTP. The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends back to the sender RTCP feedback packets containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion control. </description>
