        <title>RFC 3087: Control of Service Context using SIP Request-URI, B. Campbell, R. Sparks</title>
        <dc:date>2001-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a useful way to conceptualize the use of the standard SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Request-URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that the authors and many members of the SIP community think is suitable as a convention.  It does not define any new protocol with respect to RFC 2543.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
