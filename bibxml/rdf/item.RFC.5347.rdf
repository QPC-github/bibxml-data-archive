        <title>RFC 5347: Media Gateway Control Protocol Fax Package, F. Andreasen, D. Hancock</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package to support fax calls.  The package allows for fax calls to be supported in two different ways.  The first one utilizes ITU-T Recommendation T.38 for fax relay under the control of the Call Agent.  The second one lets the gateway decide upon a method for fax transmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without Call Agent involvement.  This memo provides information for the Internet  community. </description>
