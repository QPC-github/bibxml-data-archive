        <title>RFC 7923: Requirements for Subscription to YANG Datastores, E. Voit, A. Clemm, A. Gonzalez Prieto</title>
        <dc:date>2016-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides requirements for a service that allows client applications to subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore.  Based on criteria negotiated as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed to targeted recipients.  Such a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF).  Such a service can be summarized as a "pub/sub" service for YANG datastore updates. Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.  These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees. </description>
