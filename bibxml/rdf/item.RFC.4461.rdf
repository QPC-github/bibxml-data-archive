        <title>RFC 4461: Signaling Requirements for Point-to-Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), S. Yasukawa</title>
        <dc:date>2006-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The requirements presented in this document not only apply to packet-switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but also encompass the requirements of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port switching networks managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols.  Protocol solutions developed to meet the requirements set out in this document must attempt to be equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
