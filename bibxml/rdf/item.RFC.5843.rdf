        <title>RFC 5843: Additional Hash Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests, A. Bryan</title>
        <dc:date>2010-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by Instance Digests in HTTP.  Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.  This document adds new values to the registry and updates previous values.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
