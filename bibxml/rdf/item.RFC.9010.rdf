        <title>RFC 9010: Routing for RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) Leaves, P. Thubert, M. Richardson</title>
        <dc:date>2021-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification provides a mechanism for a host that implements a routing-agnostic interface based on IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery to obtain reachability services across a network that leverages RFC 6550 for its routing operations. It updates RFCs 6550, 6775, and 8505. </description>
