        <title>RFC 4015: The Eifel Response Algorithm for TCP, R. Ludwig, A. Gurtov</title>
        <dc:date>2005-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Based on an appropriate detection algorithm, the Eifel response algorithm provides a way for a TCP sender to respond to a detected spurious timeout.  It adapts the retransmission timer to avoid further spurious timeouts and (depending on the detection algorithm) can avoid the often unnecessary go-back-N retransmits that would otherwise be sent.  In addition, the Eifel response algorithm restores the congestion control state in such a way that packet bursts are avoided.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
