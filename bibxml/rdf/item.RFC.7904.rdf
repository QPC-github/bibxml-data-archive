        <title>RFC 7904: A SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), C. Jennings, B. Lowekamp, E. Rescorla, S. Baset, H. Schulzrinne, T. Schmidt</title>

        <description>This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or registrar in a fully distributed system and includes a lookup service for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow the registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the overlay.  After such initial contact of a Peer, the RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which SIP messages are exchanged. </description>
