        <title>RFC 7427: Signature Authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2), T. Kivinen, J. Snyder</title>
        <dc:date>2015-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve groups, and there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group.  This document generalizes IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature method supported by PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism and is not limited to ECDSA; it can also be used with other signature algorithms. </description>
