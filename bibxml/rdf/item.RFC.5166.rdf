        <title>RFC 5166: Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control Mechanisms, S. Floyd</title>
        <dc:date>2008-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG).  As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like.  However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
