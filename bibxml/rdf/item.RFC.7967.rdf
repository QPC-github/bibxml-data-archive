        <title>RFC 7967: Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Option for No Server Response, A. Bhattacharyya, S. Bandyopadhyay, A. Pal, T. Bose</title>
        <dc:date>2016-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification introduces a CoAP option called 'No-Response'. Using this option, the client can explicitly express to the server its disinterest in all responses against the particular request. This option also provides granular control to enable expression of disinterest to a particular response class or a combination of response classes.  The server MAY decide to suppress the response by not transmitting it back to the client according to the value of the No-Response option in the request.  This option may be effective for both unicast and multicast requests.  This document also discusses a few examples of applications that benefit from this option. </description>
