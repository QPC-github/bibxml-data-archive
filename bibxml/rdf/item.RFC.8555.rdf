        <title>RFC 8555: Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME), R. Barnes, J. Hoffman-Andrews, D. McCarney, J. Kasten</title>
        <dc:date>2019-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used for a number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain names.  Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate.  As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms.  This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance.  The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation. </description>
