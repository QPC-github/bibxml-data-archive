        <title>RFC 5582: Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture and Framework, H. Schulzrinne</title>
        <dc:date>2009-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an architecture for a global, scalable, resilient, and administratively distributed system for mapping geographic location information to URLs, using the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol.  The architecture generalizes well-known approaches found in hierarchical lookup systems such as DNS.  This  memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
