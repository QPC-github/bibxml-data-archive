        <title>RFC 5687: GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol: Problem Statement and Requirements, H. Tschofenig, H. Schulzrinne</title>
        <dc:date>2010-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements, and captures design aspects for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 (L7) Location Configuration Protocol (LCP).  This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network.  The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes.  For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
