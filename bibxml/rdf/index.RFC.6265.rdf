        <title>RFC 6265: HTTP State Management Mechanism, A. Barth</title>
        <dc:date>2011-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 2965.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
