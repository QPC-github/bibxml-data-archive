        <title>RFC 3407: Session Description Protocol (SDP) Simple Capability Declaration, F. Andreasen</title>
        <dc:date>2002-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes that enables SDP to provide a minimal and backwards compatible capability declaration mechanism.  Such capability declarations can be used as input to a subsequent session negotiation, which is done by means outside the scope of this document.  This provides a simple and limited solution to the general capability negotiation problem being addressed by the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
