        <title>RFC 3883: Detecting Inactive Neighbors over OSPF Demand Circuits (DC), S. Rao, A. Zinin, A. Roy</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.  OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the amount of overhead traffic.  A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the Hello suppression mechanism.  This technique allows a demand circuit to go down when no interesting traffic is going through the link.  However, it also introduces a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over such a link.  This memo introduces a new mechanism called "neighbor probing" to address the above problem.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
