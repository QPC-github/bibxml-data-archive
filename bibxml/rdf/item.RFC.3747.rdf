        <title>RFC 3747: The Differentiated Services Configuration MIB, H. Hazewinkel, D. Partain</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a MIB module that provides a conceptual layer between high-level "network-wide" policy definitions that effect configuration of the Differentiated Services (diffserv) subsystem and the instance-specific information that would include such details as the parameters for all the queues associated with each interface in a system.  This essentially provides an interface for configuring differentiated services at a conceptually higher layer than that of the Differentiated Services MIB.  [PROPOSED STANDARD] </description>
