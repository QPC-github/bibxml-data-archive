        <description>Internet Transparency via the end-to-end architecture of the Internet has allowed vast innovation of new technologies and services [1].

We propose the Firewall Enhancement Protocol (FEP) to allow innovation, without violating the security model of a Firewall.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
