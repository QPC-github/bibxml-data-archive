        <title>RFC 7419: Common Interval Support in Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, N. Akiya, M. Binderberger, G. Mirsky</title>
        <dc:date>2014-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates RFC 5880 by defining a small set of interval values for BFD that we call "Common Intervals" and recommends implementations to support the defined intervals.  This solves the problem of finding an interval value that both BFD speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation as seen for hardware-based BFD.  It does not restrict an implementation from supporting more intervals in addition to the Common Intervals. </description>
