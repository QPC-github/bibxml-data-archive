        <title>RFC 8416: Simplified Local Internet Number Resource Management with the RPKI (SLURM), D. Ma, D. Mandelberg, T. Bruijnzeels</title>
        <dc:date>2018-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those resources.  Network operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route origin assertions. ISPs can also use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP route. However, ISPs may want to establish a local view of exceptions to the RPKI data in the form of local filters and additions.  The mechanisms described in this document provide a simple way to enable INR holders to establish a local, customized view of the RPKI, overriding global RPKI repository data as needed. </description>
