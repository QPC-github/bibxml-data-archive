        <title>RFC 1830: SMTP Service Extensions for Transmission of Large and Binary MIME Messages, G. Vaudreuil</title>
        <dc:date>1995-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP service.  The first service enables a SMTP client and server to negotiate the use of an alternate DATA command "BDAT" for efficiently sending large MIME messages.  The second extension takes advantage of the BDAT command to permit the negotiated sending of unencoded binary data.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
