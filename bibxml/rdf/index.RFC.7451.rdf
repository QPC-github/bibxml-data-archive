        <title>RFC 7451: Extension Registry for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol, S. Hollenbeck</title>
        <dc:date>2015-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes features to add functionality by extending the protocol.  It does not, however, describe how those extensions are managed.  This document describes a procedure for the registration and management of extensions to EPP, and it specifies a format for an IANA registry to record those extensions. </description>
