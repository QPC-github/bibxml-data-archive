        <title>RFC 5456: IAX: Inter-Asterisk eXchange Version 2, M. Spencer, B. Capouch, E. Guy, F. Miller, K. Shumard</title>

        <description>IAX is an "all in one" protocol for handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and media services in the same protocol.  In addition, IAX uses a single UDP data stream on a static port greatly simplifying Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway traversal, eliminating the need for other protocols to work around NAT, and simplifying network and firewall management.  IAX employs a compact encoding that decreases bandwidth usage and is well suited for Internet telephony service.  In addition, its open nature permits new payload type additions needed to support additional services.
