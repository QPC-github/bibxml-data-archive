        <title>RFC 5694: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture: Definition, Taxonomies, Examples, and Applicability, G. Camarillo, </title>
        <dc:date>2009-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In this document, we provide a survey of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) systems. The survey includes a definition and several taxonomies of P2P systems.  This survey also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the Internet.  Finally, we discuss architectural trade-offs and provide guidelines for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements of a given application.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
