        <title>RFC 4168: The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), J. Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne, G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport mechanism between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities.  SCTP is a new protocol that provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport between SIP entities that exchange a large amount of messages, including gateways and proxies.  As SIP is transport-independent, support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
