        <title>RFC 8940: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Session-Id Derivation for EAP Subscriber Identity Module (EAP-SIM), EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and Protected EAP (PEAP), A. DeKok</title>
        <dc:date>2020-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 5247 is updated to define and clarify EAP Session-Id derivation for multiple Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods.  The derivation of Session-Id was not given for EAP Subscriber Identity Module (EAP-SIM) or EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA) when using the fast reconnect exchange instead of full authentication.  The derivation of Session-Id for full authentication is clarified for both EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.  The derivation of Session-Id for Protected EAP (PEAP) is also given.  The definition for PEAP follows the definition for other TLS-based EAP methods. </description>
