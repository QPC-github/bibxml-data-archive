        <title>RFC 1191: Path MTU discovery, J.C. Mogul, S.E. Deering</title>
        <dc:date>1990-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary internet path.  It specifies a small change to the way routers generate one type of ICMP message.  For a path that passes through a router that has not been so changed, this technique might not discover the correct Path MTU, but it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice.
