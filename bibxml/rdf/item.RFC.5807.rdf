        <title>RFC 5807: Definition of Master Key between PANA Client and Enforcement Point, Y. Ohba, A. Yegin</title>
        <dc:date>2010-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a master key used between a client of the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an enforcement point, for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering.  The master key is derived from the Master Session Key of the Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA authentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address families.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
