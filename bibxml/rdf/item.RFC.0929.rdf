        <title>RFC 0929: Proposed Host-Front End Protocol, J. Lilienkamp, R. Mandell, M.A. Padlipsky</title>
        <dc:date>1984-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Host-Front End Protocol introduced in RFC-928 is described in detail    in this memo.  The first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A    PROPOSAL, NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to    request that any readers of these documents who are able to do test    implementations (a) do so and (b) coordinate their efforts with the author.    This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
