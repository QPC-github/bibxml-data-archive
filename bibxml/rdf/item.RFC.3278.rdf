        <title>RFC 3278: Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Algorithms in Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), S. Blake-Wilson, D. Brown, P. Lambert</title>
        <dc:date>2002-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public-key algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The ECC algorithms support the creation of digital signatures and the exchange of keys to encrypt or authenticate content.  The definition of the algorithm processing is based on the ANSI X9.62 standard, developed by the ANSI X9F1 working group, the IEEE 1363 standard, and the SEC 1 standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
