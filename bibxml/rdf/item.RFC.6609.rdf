        <title>RFC 6609: Sieve Email Filtering: Include Extension, C. Daboo, A. Stone</title>
        <dc:date>2012-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Sieve Email Filtering "include" extension permits users to include one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing large scripts or multiple sets of scripts much easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries of scripts.  Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
