        <title>RFC 1435: IESG Advice from Experience with Path MTU Discovery, S. Knowles</title>
        <dc:date>1993-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In the course of reviewing the MTU Discovery protocol for possible elevation to Draft Standard, a specific operational problem was uncovered.  The problem results from the optional suppression of ICMP messages implemented in some routers.  This memo outlines a modification to this practice to allow the correct functioning of MTU Discovery. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
