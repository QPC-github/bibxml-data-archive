        <title>RFC 8774: The Quantum Bug, M. Welzl</title>
        <dc:date>2020-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes "entanglement": a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be transferred instantly, with no measurable delay between peers.  This will lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some Internet paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not included as a possibility in many protocol specifications.  Worse than the millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed in time. </description>
