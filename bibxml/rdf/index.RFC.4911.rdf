        <title>RFC 4911: Encoding Instructions for the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), S. Legg</title>
        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines encoding instructions that may be used in an Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specification to alter how ASN.1 values are encoded by the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER) and Canonical Robust XML Encoding Rules (CRXER), for example, to encode a component of an ASN.1 value as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) attribute rather than as a child element.  Some of these encoding instructions also affect how an ASN.1 specification is translated into an Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) specification.  Encoding instructions that allow an ASN.1 specification to reference definitions in other XML schema languages are also defined.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
