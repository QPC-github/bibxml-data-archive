        <title>RFC 0987: Mapping between X.400 and RFC 822, S.E. Kille</title>
        <dc:date>1986-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The X.400 series protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an    Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and    forward Message Transfer Service.  It is expected that this standard    will be implemented very widely.  This document describes a set of    mappings which will enable interworking between systems operating the    X.400 protocols and systems using RFC-822 mail protocol or protocols    derived from RFC-822.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements. </description>
