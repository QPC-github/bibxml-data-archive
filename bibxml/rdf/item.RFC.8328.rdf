        <title>RFC 8328: Policy-Based Management Framework for the Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA), W. Liu, C. Xie, J. Strassner, G. Karagiannis, M. Klyus, J. Bi, Y. Cheng, D. Zhang</title>

        <description>The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy. These models point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.  Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).  The network management function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services.  This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces. </description>
