        <description>A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across national and international strategic and tactical networks.  The MMHS Elements of Service are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T X.400 (1992) international standards and are specified in STANAG 4406 Edition 2 and ACP 123.  This document specifies message header fields and associated processing for RFC 5322 (Internet Message Format) to provide a comparable messaging service.  In addition, this document provides for a STANAG 4406 / Internet Email Gateway that supports message conversion.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
