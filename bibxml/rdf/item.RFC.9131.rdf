        <title>RFC 9131: Gratuitous Neighbor Discovery: Creating Neighbor Cache Entries on First-Hop Routers, J. Linkova</title>
        <dc:date>2021-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information. This document updates RFC 4861 to allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It also updates RFC 4861 and recommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address. These changes will minimize the delay and packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link destination from a new IPv6 address. </description>
