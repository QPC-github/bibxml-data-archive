        <title>RFC 6285: Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions, B. Ver Steeg, A. Begen, T. Van Caenegem, Z. Vax</title>
        <dc:date>2011-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay. In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream.  This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition. The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed audio and video.  However, this method can also be used in other types of multicast applications where the acquisition delay is long enough to be a problem.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
