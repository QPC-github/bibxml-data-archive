        <description>This Information Model applies to the Measurement Agent within an LMAP framework.  As such, it outlines the information that is configured or preconfigured on the Measurement Agent or exists in communications with a Controller or Collector within an LMAP framework.  The purpose of such an Information Model is to provide a protocol- and device-independent view of the Measurement Agent that can be implemented via one or more Control and Report Protocols. </description>
