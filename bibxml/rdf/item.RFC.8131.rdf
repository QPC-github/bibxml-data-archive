        <description>This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of a GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.  In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and teardown of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures.  No new signaling extensions are defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature. </description>
