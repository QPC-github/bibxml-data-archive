        <title>RFC 7116: Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE), and Bundle Protocol IANA Registries, K. Scott, M. Blanchet</title>
        <dc:date>2014-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The DTNRG Research Group has defined the experimental Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) and the Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) mechanism for the InterPlanetary Network ('ipn' URI scheme). Moreover, RFC 5050 defines values for the Bundle Protocol administrative record type.  All of these fields are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group has created ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official management.  This document describes the necessary IANA actions. </description>
