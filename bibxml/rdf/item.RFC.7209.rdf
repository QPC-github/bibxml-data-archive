        <title>RFC 7209: Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN), A. Sajassi, R. Aggarwal, J. Uttaro, N. Bitar, W. Henderickx, A. Isaac</title>

        <description>The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of new applications for the technology (e.g., data center interconnect) have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily addressable by the current Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution.  In particular, multihoming with all-active forwarding is not supported, and there's no existing solution to leverage Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames.  Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network operators to specify various network parameters on top of the access configuration.  This document specifies the requirements for an Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solution, which addresses the above issues. </description>
