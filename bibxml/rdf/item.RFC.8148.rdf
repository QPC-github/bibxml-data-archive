        <title>RFC 8148: Next-Generation Vehicle-Initiated Emergency Calls, R. Gellens, B. Rosen, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2017-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation Pan- European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems (IVSs) within Europe and other regions). However, this document specifies use of a different set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD).  This document is an extension of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences being that this document makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and it adds attribute values to the metadata/control object to permit greater functionality.  This document registers a new INFO package (identical to that registered for eCall but with the addition of the VEDS MIME type).  This document also describes legacy (circuit-switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling, to provide background information and context. </description>
