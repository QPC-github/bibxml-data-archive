        <title>RFC 4947: Address Resolution Mechanisms for IP Datagrams over MPEG-2 Networks, G. Fairhurst, M. Montpetit</title>
        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex.  This document reviews current methods appropriate to a range of technologies (such as DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee), DOCSIS (Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications), and variants).  It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
