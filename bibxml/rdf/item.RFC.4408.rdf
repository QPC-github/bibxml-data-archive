        <title>RFC 4408: Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-Mail, Version 1, M. Wong, W. Schlitt</title>
        <dc:date>2006-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of the ender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby a domain may explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
