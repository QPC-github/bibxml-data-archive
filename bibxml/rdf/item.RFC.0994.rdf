        <dc:date>1986-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This Protocol Standard is one of a set of International Standards    produced to facilitate the interconnection of open systems.  The set of    standards covers the services and protocols required to achieve such    interconnection. This Protocol Standard is positioned with respect to    other related standards by the layers defined in the Reference Model    for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498).  In particular, it is a    protocol of the Network Layer.  This Protocol may be used between    network-entities in end systems or in Network Layer relay systems (or    both).  It provides the Connectionless-mode Network Service as defined    in Addendum 1 to the Network Service Definition Covering Connectionless-mode    Transmission (ISO 8348/AD1). </description>
