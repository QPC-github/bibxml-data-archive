        <description>This document describes the problem space and solution requirements for developing an IP Security Policy (IPSP) configuration and management framework.  The IPSP architecture provides a scalable, decentralized framework for managing, discovering and negotiating the host and network security policies that govern access, authorization, authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and other IP Security properties.  This document highlights such architectural components and presents their functional requirements.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
