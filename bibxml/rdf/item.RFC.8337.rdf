        <title>RFC 8337: Model-Based Metrics for Bulk Transport Capacity, M. Mathis, A. Morton</title>
        <dc:date>2018-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>For Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP diagnostics are built using test streams and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer that mimic TCP over the complete path.  The temporal structure of the test stream (e.g., bursts) mimics TCP or other transport protocols carrying bulk data over a long path.  However, they are constructed to be independent of the details of the subpath under test, end systems, or applications.  Likewise, the success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria determined by protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport Performance of the complete path.  The success criteria also does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems, or applications. </description>
