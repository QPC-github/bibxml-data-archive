        <title>RFC 5297: Synthetic Initialization Vector (SIV) Authenticated Encryption Using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), D. Harkins</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector), a block cipher mode of operation.  SIV takes a key, a plaintext, and multiple variable-length octet strings that will be authenticated but not encrypted.  It produces a ciphertext having the same length as the plaintext and a synthetic initialization vector.  Depending on how it is used, SIV achieves either the goal of deterministic authenticated encryption or the goal of nonce-based, misuse-resistant authenticated encryption.  This memo provides information for the Internet  community. </description>
