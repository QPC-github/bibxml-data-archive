        <title>RFC 6450: Multicast Ping Protocol, S. Venaas</title>
        <dc:date>2011-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this document allows for checking whether an endpoint can receive multicast -- both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source Multicast (ASM). It can also be used to obtain additional multicast-related information, such as multicast tree setup time.  This protocol is based on an implementation of tools called "ssmping" and "asmping".
