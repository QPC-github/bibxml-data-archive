        <title>RFC 8076: A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe), A. Knauf, T. Schmidt, G. Hege, M. Waehlisch</title>
        <dc:date>2017-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Usage for managing shared write access to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate.  This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a variable name that is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous processes are required. </description>
