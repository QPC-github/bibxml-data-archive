        <title>RFC 5367: Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), G. Camarillo, A.B. Roach, O. Levin</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of resources in SIP.  This is achieved by including the list of resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE request.  Instead of having a subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE request for each resource individually, the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets notifications about changes in the resources' states using a single SUBSCRIBE dialog.
