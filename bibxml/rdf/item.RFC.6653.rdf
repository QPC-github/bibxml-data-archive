        <title>RFC 6653: DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Networks, B. Sarikaya, F. Xia, T. Lemon</title>

        <description>As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases, several migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix management is the issue addressed in this document.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server.  The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP.  We also describe prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
