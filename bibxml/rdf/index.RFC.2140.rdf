        <title>RFC 2140: TCP Control Block Interdependence, J. Touch</title>
        <dc:date>1997-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo makes the case for interdependent TCP control blocks, where part of the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent connections, or across similar connection instances. TCP state includes a combination of parameters, such as connection state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion control information, and process information.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
