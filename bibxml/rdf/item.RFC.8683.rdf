        <title>RFC 8683: Additional Deployment Guidelines for NAT64/464XLAT in Operator and Enterprise Networks, J. Palet Martinez</title>
        <dc:date>2019-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64) (including 464XLAT) can be deployed in an IPv6 network -- whether it's cellular ISP, broadband ISP, or enterprise -- and the possible optimizations. This document also discusses issues to be considered when having IPv6-only connectivity, such as: a) DNS64, b) applications or devices that use literal IPv4 addresses or non-IPv6-compliant APIs, and c) IPv4-only hosts or applications. </description>
