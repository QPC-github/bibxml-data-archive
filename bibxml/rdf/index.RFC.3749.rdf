        <title>RFC 3749: Transport Layer Security Protocol Compression Methods, S. Hollenbeck</title>
        <dc:date>2004-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (RFC 2246) includes features to negotiate selection of a lossless data compression method as part of the TLS Handshake Protocol and to then apply the algorithm associated with the selected method as part of the TLS Record Protocol.  TLS defines one standard compression method which specifies that data exchanged via the record protocol will not be compressed.  This document describes an additional compression method associated with a lossless data compression algorithm for use with TLS, and it describes a method for the specification of additional TLS compression methods.
