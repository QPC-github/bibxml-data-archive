        <description>SMIng (Structure of Management Information, Next Generation) (RFC3780), is a protocol-independent data definition language for management information.  This memo defines an SMIng language extension that specifies the mapping of SMIng definitions of identities, classes, and their attributes and events to dedicated definitions of nodes, scalar objects, tables and columnar objects, and notifications, for application to the SNMP management framework.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
