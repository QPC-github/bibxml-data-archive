        <title>RFC 5981: Authorization for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols, J. Manner, M. Stiemerling, H. Tschofenig, R. Bless</title>

        <description>Signaling layer protocols specified within the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) framework may rely on the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol to handle authorization.  Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself may require separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a certain kind of service or resources.  This document presents a generic model and object formats for session authorization within the NSIS signaling layer protocols.  The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
