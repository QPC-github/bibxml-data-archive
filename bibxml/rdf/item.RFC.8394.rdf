        <title>RFC 8394: Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) Control-Plane Requirements, Y. Li, D. Eastlake 3rd, L. Kreeger, T. Narten, D. Black</title>

        <description>One or more control-plane protocols between a hypervisor and its associated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute its virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for further handling.  This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of control-plane signaling protocol and outlines the high-level requirements.  Virtual-machine states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol requirements. </description>
