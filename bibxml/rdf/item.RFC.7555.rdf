        <title>RFC 7555: Proxy MPLS Echo Request, G. Swallow, V. Lim, S. Aldrin</title>
        <dc:date>2015-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol Label Switched Protocol (MPLS) Pings on Label Switched Paths.  An MPLS Proxy Ping Request is sent to any Label Switching Router along a Label Switched Path. The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable tracing from leaf to leaf  (or root). </description>
