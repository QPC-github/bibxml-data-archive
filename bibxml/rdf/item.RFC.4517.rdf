        <title>RFC 4517: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules, S. Legg</title>
        <dc:date>2006-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, whose values may be transferred in the LDAP protocol, has a defined syntax that constrains the structure and format of its values.  The comparison semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This document defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes for LDAP directories.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
