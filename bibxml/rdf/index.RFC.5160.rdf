        <title>RFC 5160: Considerations of Provider-to-Provider Agreements for Internet-Scale Quality of Service (QoS), P. Levis, M. Boucadair</title>
        <dc:date>2008-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo analyzes provider-to-provider Quality of Service (QoS) agreements suitable for a global QoS-enabled Internet.  It defines terminology relevant to inter-domain QoS models.  It proposes a new concept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class (MQC).  This concept could potentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain relationships are built between providers.  It opens up new perspectives for a QoS- enabled Internet that retains, as much as possible, the openness of the existing best-effort Internet.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
