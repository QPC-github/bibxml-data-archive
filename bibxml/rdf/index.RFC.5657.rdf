        <title>RFC 5657: Guidance on Interoperation and Implementation Reports for Advancement to Draft Standard, L. Dusseault, R. Sparks</title>
        <dc:date>2009-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Advancing a protocol to Draft Standard requires documentation of the interoperation and implementation of the protocol.  Historic reports have varied widely in form and level of content and there is little guidance available to new report preparers.  This document updates the existing processes and provides more detail on what is appropriate in an interoperability and implementation report.   This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
