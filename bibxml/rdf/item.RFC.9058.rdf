        <description>MGM has been standardized in Russia. It is used as an AEAD mode for the GOST block cipher algorithms in many protocols, e.g., TLS 1.3 and IPsec. This document provides a reference for MGM to enable review of the mechanisms in use and to make MGM available for use with any block cipher. </description>
