        <title>RFC 7011: Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of Flow Information, B. Claise, B. Trammell, P. Aitken</title>
        <dc:date>2013-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol, which serves as a means for transmitting Traffic Flow information over the network.  In order to transmit Traffic Flow information from an Exporting Process to a Collecting Process, a common representation of flow data and a standard means of communicating them are required.  This document describes how the IPFIX Data and Template Records are carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX Exporting Process to an IPFIX Collecting Process.  This document obsoletes RFC 5101. </description>
