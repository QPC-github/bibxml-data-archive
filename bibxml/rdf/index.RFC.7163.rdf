        <title>RFC 7163: URN for Country-Specific Emergency Services, C. Holmberg, I. Sedlacek</title>
        <dc:date>2014-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates the registration guidance provided in Section 4.2 of RFC 5031, which allows the registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type only for emergency services "that               are offered widely and in different countries".  This document updates those instructions to allow such registrations when, at the time of registration, those services are offered in only one country. </description>
