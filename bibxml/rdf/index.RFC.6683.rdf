        <title>RFC 6683: Guidelines for Implementing Digital Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV) Application-Layer Hybrid Forward Error Correction (FEC) Protection, A. Begen, T. Stockhammer</title>
        <dc:date>2012-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Annex E of the Digital Video Broadcasting - IPTV (DVB-IPTV) technical specification defines an optional Application-Layer Forward Error Correction (AL-FEC) protocol to protect the streaming media transported using RTP.  The DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for FEC protection.  The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleaved parity code.  The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor code.  By offering a layered approach, the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol offers good protection against both bursty and random packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.  This document describes how one can implement the DVB-IPTV AL-FEC protocol by using the 1-D interleaved parity code and Raptor code that have already been specified in separate documents.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
