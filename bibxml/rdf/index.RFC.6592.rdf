        <title>RFC 6592: The Null Packet, C. Pignataro</title>
        <dc:date>2012-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The ever-elusive Null Packet received numerous mentions in documents in the RFC series, but it has never been explicitly defined.  This memo corrects that omission.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
