        <title>RFC 4124: Protocol Extensions for Support of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering, F. Le Faucheur</title>
        <dc:date>2005-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies the protocol extensions for support of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE).  This includes generalization of the semantics of a number of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions already defined for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering in RFC 3630, RFC 3784, and additional IGP extensions beyond those.  This also includes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling beyond those already specified in RFC 3209 for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering.  These extensions address the requirements for DS-TE spelled out in RFC 3564.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
