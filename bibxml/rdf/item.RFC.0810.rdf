        <title>RFC 0810: DoD Internet host table specification, E.J. Feinler, K. Harrenstien, Z. Su, V. White</title>
        <dc:date>1982-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC specifies a new host table format applicable to both ARPANET and Internet needs.  In addition to host name to host address translation and selected protocol information, we have also included network and gateway name to address correspondence, and host operating system information.  This RFC obsoletes the host table described in RFC 608. </description>
