        <title>RFC 7799: Active and Passive Metrics and Methods (with Hybrid Types In-Between), A. Morton</title>
        <dc:date>2016-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Some methods may use a subset of both Active and Passive attributes, and we refer to these as "Hybrid Methods".  This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge. </description>
