        <title>RFC 4828: TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): The Small-Packet (SP) Variant, S. Floyd, E. Kohler</title>
        <dc:date>2007-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Flows using TFRC-SP compete reasonably fairly with large-packet TCP and TFRC flows in environments where large-packet flows and small-packet flows experience similar packet drop rates.  However, in environments where small-packet flows experience lower packet drop rates than large-packet flows (e.g., with Drop-Tail queues in units of bytes), TFRC-SP can receive considerably more than its share of the bandwidth.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
