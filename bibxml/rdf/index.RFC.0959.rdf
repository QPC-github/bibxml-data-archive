        <title>RFC 0959: File Transfer Protocol, J. Postel, J. Reynolds</title>
        <dc:date>1985-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo is the official specification of the File Transfer Protocol    (FTP) for the DARPA Internet community.  The primary intent is to    clarify and correct the documentation of the FTP specification, not to    change the protocol.  The following new optional commands are included    in this edition of the specification:  Change to Parent Directory    (CDUP), Structure Mount (SMNT), Store Unique (STOU), Remove Directory    (RMD), Make Directory (MKD), Print Directory (PWD), and System (SYST).    Note that this specification is compatible with the previous edition. </description>
