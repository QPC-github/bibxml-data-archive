        <title>RFC 5310: IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication, M. Bhatia, V. Manral, T. Li, R. Atkinson, R. White, M. Fanto</title>
        <dc:date>2009-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Although this document has been written specifically for using the Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) construct along with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of cryptographic hash functions, the method described in this document is generic and can be used to extend IS-IS to support any cryptographic hash function in the future.
