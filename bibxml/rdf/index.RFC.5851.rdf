        <title>RFC 5851: Framework and Requirements for an Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Multi-Service Networks, S. Ooghe, N. Voigt, M. Platnic, T. Haag, S. Wadhwa</title>
        <dc:date>2010-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document first identifies a number of use cases for which the Access Node Control Mechanism may be appropriate.  It then presents the requirements for the Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) that must be taken into account during protocol design.  Finally, it describes requirements for the network elements that need to support ANCP and the described use cases.  These requirements should be seen as guidelines rather than as absolute requirements.  RFC 2119 therefore does not apply to the nodal requirements.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published  for informational purposes. </description>
