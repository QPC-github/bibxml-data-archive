        <title>RFC 6017: Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) Features Header Field, K. Meadors</title>
        <dc:date>2010-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>With the maturity of the Electronic Data Interchange - Internet Integration (EDIINT) standards of AS1, AS2, and AS3, applications and additional features are being built upon the basic secure transport functionality.  These features are not necessarily supported by all EDIINT applications and could cause potential problems with implementations.  The EDIINT-Features header field provides a means to resolve these problems and support new functionality.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
