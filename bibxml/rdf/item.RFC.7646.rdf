        <title>RFC 7646: Definition and Use of DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors, P. Ebersman, W. Kumari, C. Griffiths, J. Livingood, R. Weber</title>
        <dc:date>2015-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.  This document defines Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs), which can be used to mitigate DNSSEC validation failures by disabling DNSSEC validation at specified domains. </description>
