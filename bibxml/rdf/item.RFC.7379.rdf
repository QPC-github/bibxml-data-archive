        <title>RFC 7379: Problem Statement and Goals for Active-Active Connection at the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Edge, Y. Li, W. Hao, R. Perlman, J. Hudson, H. Zhai</title>

        <description>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow-level multipathing with rapid failover for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology.  Active-active connection at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus.  This informational document discusses the high-level problems and goals when providing active-active connection at the TRILL edge. </description>
