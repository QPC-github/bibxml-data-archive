        <title>RFC 8775: PIM Designated Router Load Balancing, Y. Cai, H. Ou, S. Vallepalli, M. Mishra, S. Venaas, A. Green</title>

        <description>On a multi-access network, one of the PIM-SM (PIM Sparse Mode) routers is elected as a Designated Router. One of the responsibilities of the Designated Router is to track local multicast listeners and forward data to these listeners if the group is operating in PIM-SM. This document specifies a modification to the PIM-SM protocol that allows more than one of the PIM-SM routers to take on this responsibility so that the forwarding load can be distributed among multiple routers. </description>
