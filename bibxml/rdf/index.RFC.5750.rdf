        <title>RFC 5750: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Certificate Handling, B. Ramsdell, S. Turner</title>
        <dc:date>2010-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v3.2 agents. S/MIME provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing. S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 5280, the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile. S/MIME agents must meet the certificate processing requirements in this document as well as those in RFC 5280.  This document obsoletes RFC 3850.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
