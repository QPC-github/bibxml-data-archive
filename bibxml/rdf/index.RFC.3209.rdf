        <title>RFC 3209: RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels, D. Awduche, L. Berger, D. Gan, T. Li, V. Srinivasan, G. Swallow</title>
        <dc:date>2001-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol), including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs) in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching).  Since the flow along an LSP is completely identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may be treated as tunnels.  A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
