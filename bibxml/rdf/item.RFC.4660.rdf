        <description>This document describes the operations a subscriber performs in order to put filtering rules associated with a subscription to event notification information in place.  The handling, by the subscriber, of responses to subscriptions carrying filtering rules and the handling of notifications with filtering rules applied to them are also described.  Furthermore, the document conveys how the notifier behaves when receiving such filtering rules and how a notification is constructed.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
