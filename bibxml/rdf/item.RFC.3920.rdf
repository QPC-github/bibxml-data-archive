        <title>RFC 3920: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core, P. Saint-Andre</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a protocol for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements in order to exchange structured information in close to real time between any two network endpoints.  While XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for exchanging XML data, it is used mainly for the purpose of building instant messaging and presence applications that meet the requirements of RFC 2779.
