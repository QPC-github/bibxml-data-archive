        <title>RFC 6636: Tuning the Behavior of the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for Routers in Mobile and Wireless Networks, H. Asaeda, H. Liu, Q. Wu</title>
        <dc:date>2012-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) are the protocols used by hosts and multicast routers to exchange their IP multicast group memberships with each other. This document describes ways to achieve IGMPv3 and MLDv2 protocol optimization for mobility and aims to become a guideline for the tuning of IGMPv3/MLDv2 Queries, timers, and counter values.  This  document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
