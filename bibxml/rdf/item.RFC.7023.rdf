        <description>This document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance with the Pseudowire  Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architecture to realize an  end-to-end emulated Ethernet service.  It standardizes the  behavior of Provider Edges (PEs) with respect to Ethernet PW and AC defects. </description>
