        <title>RFC 7408: Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) Model Extension, E. Haleplidis</title>
        <dc:date>2014-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo extends the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) model defined in RFC 5812 and updates that RFC to allow complex data types for metadata, optional default values for data types, and optional access types for structures.  It also fixes an issue with Logical Functional Block (LFB) inheritance and introduces two new features: a new event condition called eventBecomesEqualTo and LFB properties.  The changes introduced in this memo do not alter the protocol and retain backward compatibility with older LFB models. </description>
