        <dc:date>2010-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The document also defines a URN to identify both services and User Agent (UA) applications.  This URN can be used within the SIP header fields defined in this document to identify services, and also within the framework defined for caller preferences and callee capabilities to identify usage of both services and applications between end UAs.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
