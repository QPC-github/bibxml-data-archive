        <title>RFC 3771: The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Intermediate Response Message, R. Harrison, K. Zeilenga</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines and describes the IntermediateResponse message, a general mechanism for defining single-request/multiple-response operations in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The IntermediateResponse message is defined in such a way that the protocol behavior of existing LDAP operations is maintained.  This message is intended to be used in conjunction with the LDAP ExtendedRequest and ExtendedResponse to define new single-request/multiple-response operations or in conjunction with a control when extending existing LDAP operations in a way that requires them to return intermediate response information.
