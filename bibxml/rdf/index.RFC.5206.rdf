        <title>RFC 5206: End-Host Mobility and Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol, P. Nikander, T. Henderson, C. Vogt, J. Arkko</title>
        <dc:date>2008-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.  This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same LOCATOR parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are left for further study.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
