        <description>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a variety of short-term and long-term reception statistics.  The available reporting may include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting.  This document specifies a report computing the bytes discarded from the de-jitter buffer after successful reception. </description>
