        <title>RFC 8833: Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) for WebRTC, M. Thomson</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies two Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) labels for use with Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC).  The "webrtc" label identifies regular WebRTC: a DTLS session that is used to establish keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) or to establish data channels using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) over DTLS.  The "c-webrtc" label describes the same protocol, but the peers also agree to maintain the confidentiality of the media by not sharing it with other applications. </description>
