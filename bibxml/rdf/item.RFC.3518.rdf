        <title>RFC 3518: Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Bridging Control Protocol (BCP), M. Higashiyama, F. Baker, T. Liao</title>
        <dc:date>2003-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP) and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines the NCP for establishing and configuring Remote Bridging for PPP links. This document obsoletes RFC 2878, which was based on the IEEE 802.1D- 1993 MAC Bridge.  This document extends that specification by improving support for bridge control packets.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
