        <title>RFC 4707: Netnews Administration System (NAS), P. Grau, V. Heinau, H. Schlichting, R. Schuettler</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>NAS is usable in coexistence with the current, established process of control messages; an unwanted interference is impossible. Furthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of Usenet in a hierarchical database.  NAS can be used without modification of existing news relay, news server, or news reader software; however, some tasks will be better accomplished with NAS-compliant software.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
