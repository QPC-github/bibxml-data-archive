        <title>RFC 8249: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): MTU Negotiation, M. Zhang, X. Zhang, D. Eastlake 3rd, R. Perlman, S. Chatterjee</title>
        <dc:date>2017-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325 and 7177, that assures that link-state changes can be successfully flooded throughout the campus while being able to take advantage of a campus-wide capability to support jumbo packets.  This document specifies recommended updates to that MTU feature to take advantage, for appropriate link-local packets, of link-local MTUs that exceed the TRILL campus MTU.  In addition, it specifies an efficient algorithm for local MTU testing.  This document updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7780. </description>
