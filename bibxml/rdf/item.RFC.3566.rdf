        <title>RFC 3566: The AES-XCBC-MAC-96 Algorithm and Its Use With IPsec, S. Frankel, H. Herbert</title>
        <dc:date>2003-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash function.  One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a block cipher in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of operation.  The classic CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for messages of a pre-selected fixed length, has been shown to be insecure across messages of varying lengths such as the type found in typical IP datagrams.  This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode with a set of extensions to overcome this limitation.  This new algorithm is named AES-XCBC-MAC-96.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
