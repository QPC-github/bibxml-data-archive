        <title>RFC 6481: A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure, G. Huston, R. Loomans, G. Michaelson</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a profile for the structure of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) distributed repository.  Each individual repository publication point is a directory that contains files that correspond to X.509/PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed objects.  This profile defines the object (file) naming scheme, the contents of repository publication points (directories), and a suggested internal structure of a local repository cache that is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed collection of repository publication points and to facilitate certification path construction.
