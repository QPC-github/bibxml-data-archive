        <title>RFC 6896: SCS: KoanLogic's Secure Cookie Sessions for HTTP, S. Barbato, S. Dorigotti, T. Fossati</title>
        <dc:date>2013-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Secure Cookie Session (SCS) use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from distribution of authorized content via HTTP (e.g., with out-of-band signed URIs) to securing browser sessions with diskless embedded devices (e.g., Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) routers) or web servers with high availability or load- balancing requirements that may want to delegate the handling of the application state to clients instead of using shared storage or forced peering. </description>
