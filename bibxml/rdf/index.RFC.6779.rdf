        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state, performance information, and notifications about NHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor discovery.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
