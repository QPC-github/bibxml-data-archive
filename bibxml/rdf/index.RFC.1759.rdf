        <title>RFC 1759: Printer MIB, R. Smith, F. Wright, T. Hastings, S. Zilles, J. Gyllenskog</title>

        <description>A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input source, produces marks on that media according to some page description or page control language and puts the result in some output destination, possibly with finishing applied. The information needed in the management of the physical printer and the management of a printing job overlap highly and many of the tasks in each management area require the same or similar information.
