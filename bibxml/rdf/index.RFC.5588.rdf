        <dc:date>2009-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a new function for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which allows applications to store delegated (and other) credentials in the implicit GSS-API credential store.  This is needed for GSS-API applications to use delegated credentials as they would use other credentials.   [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
