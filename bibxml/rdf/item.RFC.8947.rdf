        <title>RFC 8947: Link-Layer Address Assignment Mechanism for DHCPv6, B. Volz, T. Mrugalski, C. Bernardos</title>
        <dc:date>2020-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In certain environments, e.g., large-scale virtualization deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner. Such devices may have their link-layer addresses assigned in an automated fashion. With sufficient scale, the likelihood of a collision using random assignment without duplication detection is not acceptable. Therefore, an allocation mechanism is required. This document proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments where preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by a manufacturer) are not possible or are unnecessary. </description>
