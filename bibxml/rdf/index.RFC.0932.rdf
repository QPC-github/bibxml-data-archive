        <title>RFC 0932: Subnetwork addressing scheme, D.D. Clark</title>
        <dc:date>1985-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposes an alternative addressing scheme for subnets which, in    most cases, requires no modification to host software whatsoever.  The    drawbacks of this scheme are that the total number of subnets in any one    network are limited, and that modification is required to all gateways. </description>
