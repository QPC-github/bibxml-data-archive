        <title>RFC 4962: Guidance for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Key Management, R. Housley, B. Aboba</title>
        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides guidance to designers of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) key management protocols.  The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key management protocols.  Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols.  The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication as IETF RFCs.  Further, these guidelines will be useful to other standards development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
