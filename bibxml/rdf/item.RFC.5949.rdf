        <title>RFC 5949: Fast Handovers for Proxy Mobile IPv6, H. Yokota, K. Chowdhury, R. Koodli, B. Patil, F. Xia</title>
        <dc:date>2010-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>When the fast handover is considered in such an environment, several modifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based mobility management.  This document specifies the usage of fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6; RFC 5568) when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as the mobility management protocol.  Necessary extensions are specified for FMIPv6 to support the scenario when the mobile node does not have IP mobility functionality and hence is not involved with either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations.
