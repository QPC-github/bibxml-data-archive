        <title>RFC 7148: Prefix Delegation Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6, X. Zhou, J. Korhonen, C. Williams, S. Gundavelli, CJ. Bernardos</title>
        <dc:date>2014-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification defines extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain IP prefixes for its attached mobile networks using DHCPv6 prefix delegation.  Network-based mobility management support is provided for those delegated IP prefixes just as it is provided for the mobile node's home address.  Even if the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes. </description>
