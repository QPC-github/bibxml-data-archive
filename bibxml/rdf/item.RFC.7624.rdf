        <title>RFC 7624: Confidentiality in the Face of Pervasive Surveillance: A Threat Model and Problem Statement, R. Barnes, B. Schneier, C. Jennings, T. Hardie, B. Trammell, C. Huitema, D. Borkmann</title>

        <description>Since the initial revelations of pervasive surveillance in 2013, several classes of attacks on Internet communications have been discovered.  In this document, we develop a threat model that describes these attacks on Internet confidentiality.  We assume an attacker that is interested in undetected, indiscriminate eavesdropping.  The threat model is based on published, verified attacks. </description>
