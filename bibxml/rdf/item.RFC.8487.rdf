        <title>RFC 8487: Mtrace Version 2: Traceroute Facility for IP Multicast, H. Asaeda, K. Meyer, W. Lee</title>
        <dc:date>2018-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the IP multicast traceroute facility, named Mtrace version 2 (Mtrace2).  Unlike unicast traceroute, Mtrace2 requires special implementations on the part of routers.  This specification describes the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how an Mtrace2 client invokes a Query and receives a Reply. </description>
