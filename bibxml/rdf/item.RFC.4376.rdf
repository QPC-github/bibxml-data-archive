        <title>RFC 4376: Requirements for Floor Control Protocols, P. Koskelainen, J. Ott, H. Schulzrinne, X. Wu</title>
        <dc:date>2006-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment. Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation, and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.  This document defines the requirements for a floor control protocol for multiparty conferences in the context of an existing framework.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
