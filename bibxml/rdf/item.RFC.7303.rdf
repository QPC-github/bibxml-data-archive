        <title>RFC 7303: XML Media Types, H. Thompson, C. Lilley</title>
        <dc:date>2014-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd -- for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/ xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/ types.  This specification also standardizes the '+xml' suffix for naming media types outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME entities. </description>
