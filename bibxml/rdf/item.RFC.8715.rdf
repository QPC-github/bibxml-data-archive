        <title>RFC 8715: IETF Administrative Support Activity 2.0: Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust, J. Arkko</title>
        <dc:date>2020-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>At the time RFC 8714 was published, the changes to the IETF Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an impact on the IETF Trust because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides background on the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update. </description>
