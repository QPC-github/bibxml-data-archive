        <title>RFC 7449: Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Requirements for Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) Routing and Wavelength Assignment, Y. Lee, G. Bernstein, J. Martensson, T. Takeda, T. Tsuritani, O. Gonzalez de Dios</title>

        <description>This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).  Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation.  Requirements for PCEP extensions in support of optical impairments will be addressed in a separate document. </description>
