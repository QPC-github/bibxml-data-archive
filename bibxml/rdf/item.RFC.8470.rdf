        <title>RFC 8470: Using Early Data in HTTP, M. Thomson, M. Nottingham, W. Tarreau</title>
        <dc:date>2018-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Using TLS early data creates an exposure to the possibility of a replay attack.  This document defines mechanisms that allow clients to communicate with servers about HTTP requests that are sent in early data.  Techniques are described that use these mechanisms to mitigate the risk of replay. </description>
