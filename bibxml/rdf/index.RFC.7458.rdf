        <title>RFC 7458: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Attributes for Wi-Fi Integration with the Evolved Packet Core, R. Valmikam, R. Koodli</title>
        <dc:date>2015-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA', protocol is required for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks.  This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such networks.  The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a Mobile Node (MN)) and its network counterpart (such as an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server) in the service provider's infrastructure. </description>
