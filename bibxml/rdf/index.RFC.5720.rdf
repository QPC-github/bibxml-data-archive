        <title>RFC 5720: Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER), F. Templin</title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term "enterprise network" within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an "enterprise" can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.
