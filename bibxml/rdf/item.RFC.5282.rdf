        <title>RFC 5282: Using Authenticated Encryption Algorithms with the Encrypted Payload of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) Protocol, D. Black, D. McGrew</title>
        <dc:date>2008-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The use of two specific authenticated encryption algorithms with the IKEv2 Encrypted Payload is also described; these two algorithms are the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) and AES in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (AES CCM).  Additional documents may describe the use of other authenticated encryption algorithms with the IKEv2 Encrypted Payload.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
