        <title>RFC 0940: Toward an Internet standard scheme for subnetting, </title>
        <dc:date>1985-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the    Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of    little interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing    these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the    Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be    an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices    that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general scheme is    called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the    connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).    This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted    environments in the ARPA-Internet. </description>
