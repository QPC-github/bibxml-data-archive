        <title>RFC 0910: Multimedia mail meeting notes, H.C. Forsdick</title>
        <dc:date>1984-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo is a report on a meeting about the experimental multimedia    mail system (and in a sense a status report on that experiment).  The    meeting was held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July 1984 to    discuss recent progress by groups who are building multimedia mail    systems and to discuss a variety of issues related to the further    development of multimedia systems.  Representatives were present from    BBN, ISI, SRI and Linkabit. </description>
