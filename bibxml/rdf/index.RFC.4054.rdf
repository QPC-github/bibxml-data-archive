        <title>RFC 4054: Impairments and Other Constraints on Optical Layer Routing, J. Strand, A. Chiu</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Optical networking poses a number challenges for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).  Fundamentally, optical technology is an analog rather than digital technology whereby the optical layer is lowest in the transport hierarchy and hence has an intimate relationship with the physical geography of the network. This contribution surveys some of the aspects of optical networks that impact routing and identifies possible GMPLS responses for each: (1) Constraints arising from the design of new software controllable network elements, (2) Constraints in a single all-optical domain without wavelength conversion, (3) Complications arising in more complex networks incorporating both all-optical and opaque architectures, and (4) Impacts of diversity constraints.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
