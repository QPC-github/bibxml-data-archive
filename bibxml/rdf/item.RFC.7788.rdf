        <description>This document describes the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP), an extensible configuration protocol, and a set of requirements for home network devices.  HNCP is described as a profile of and extension to the Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP).  HNCP enables discovery of network borders, automated configuration of addresses, name resolution, service discovery, and the use of any routing protocol that supports routing based on both the source and destination address. </description>
