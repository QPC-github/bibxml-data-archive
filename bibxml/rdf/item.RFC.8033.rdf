        <title>RFC 8033: Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE): A Lightweight Control Scheme to Address the Bufferbloat Problem, R. Pan, P. Natarajan, F. Baker, G. White</title>

        <description>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations.  The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software. </description>
