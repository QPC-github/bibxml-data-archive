        <title>RFC 3843: RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Compression Profile for IP, L-E. Jonsson, G. Pelletier</title>
        <dc:date>2004-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC (RFC 3095) defines a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), IP/UDP, and also a profile for uncompressed packet streams.  However, no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as a missing piece in RFC 3095.  This document defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP, and enhanced to compress IP header chains of arbitrary length.
