        <title>RFC 1056: PCMAIL: A distributed mail system for personal computers, M.L. Lambert</title>
        <dc:date>1988-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo is a discussion of the Pcmail workstation based distributed mail system.  It is identical to the discussion in RFC-993, save that a new, much simpler mail transport protocol is described.  The new transport protocol is the result of continued research into ease of protocol implementation and use issues. </description>
