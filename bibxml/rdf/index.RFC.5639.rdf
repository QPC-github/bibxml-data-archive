        <title>RFC 5639: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool Standard Curves and Curve Generation, M. Lochter, J. Merkle</title>
        <dc:date>2010-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo proposes several elliptic curve domain parameters over finite prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  The domain parameters are consistent with the relevant international standards, and can be used in X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs), for Internet Key Exchange (IKE), Transport Layer Security (TLS), XML signatures, and all applications or protocols based on the cryptographic message syntax (CMS).  This document is  not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
