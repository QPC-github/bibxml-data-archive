        <title>RFC 1075: Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol, D. Waitzman, C. Partridge, S.E. Deering</title>
        <dc:date>1988-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC describes a distance-vector-style routing protocol for routing multicast datagrams through an internet.  It is derived from the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and implements multicasting as described in RFC-1054.  This is an experimental protocol, and its implementation is not recommended at this time. </description>
