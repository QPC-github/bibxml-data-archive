        <title>RFC 5595: The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes, G. Fairhurst</title>
        <dc:date>2009-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340.  It motivates the setting of a Service Code by applications.  Service Codes provide a method to identify the intended service/application to process a DCCP connection request.  This provides improved flexibility in the use and assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing.  The use of a DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services with middleboxes (e.g., network address translators and firewalls).  This document updates the specification provided in RFC 4340.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
