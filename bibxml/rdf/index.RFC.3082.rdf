        <title>RFC 3082: Notification and Subscription for SLP, J. Kempf, J. Goldschmidt</title>
        <dc:date>2001-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides mechanisms whereby service agent clients can advertise and user agent clients can query for services.  The design is very much demand-driven, so that user agents only obtain service information when they specifically ask for it. There exists another class of user agent applications, however, that requires notification when a new service appears or disappears. In the RFC 2608 design, these applications are forced to poll the network to catch changes.  In this document, we describe a protocol for allowing such clients to be notified when a change occurs, removing the need for polling.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
