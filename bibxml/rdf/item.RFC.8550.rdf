        <title>RFC 8550: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 4.0 Certificate Handling, J. Schaad, B. Ramsdell, S. Turner</title>
        <dc:date>2019-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v4.0 agents. S/MIME provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing. S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 5280 ("Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and                                     Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile").  S/MIME agents must meet the certificate-processing requirements in this document as well as those in RFC 5280.  This document obsoletes RFC 5750. </description>
