        <title>RFC 5609: State Machines for the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA), V. Fajardo, Y. Ohba, R. Marin-Lopez</title>
        <dc:date>2009-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines the conceptual state machines for the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA).  The state machines consist of the PANA Client (PaC) state machine and the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) state machine.  The two state machines show how PANA can interface with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) state machines.  The state machines and associated models are informative only.  Implementations may achieve the same results using different methods.  This memo provides information  for the Internet community. </description>
