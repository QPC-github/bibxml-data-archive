        <title>RFC 7804: Salted Challenge Response HTTP Authentication Mechanism, A. Melnikov</title>
        <dc:date>2016-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms. </description>
