        <title>RFC 4661: An Extensible Markup Language (XML)-Based Format for Event Notification Filtering, H. Khartabil, E. Leppanen, M. Lonnfors, J. Costa-Requena</title>

        <description>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to a state of a resource.  The document does not describe a mechanism whereby filtering of event notification information can be achieved.  Filtering is a mechanism for defining the preferred notification information to be delivered and for specifying triggers that cause that information to be delivered.  In order to enable this, a format is needed to enable the subscriber to describe the state changes of a resource that cause notifications to be sent to it and what those notifications are to contain.  This document presents a format in the form of an XML document.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
