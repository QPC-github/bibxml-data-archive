        <title>RFC 4204: Link Management Protocol (LMP), J. Lang</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>For scalability purposes, multiple data links can be combined to form a single traffic engineering (TE) link.  Furthermore, the management of TE links is not restricted to in-band messaging, but instead can be done using out-of-band techniques.  This document specifies a link management protocol (LMP) that runs between a pair of nodes and is used to manage TE links.  Specifically, LMP will be used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify the physical connectivity of the data links, correlate the link property information, suppress downstream alarms, and localize link failures for protection/restoration purposes in multiple kinds of networks.
