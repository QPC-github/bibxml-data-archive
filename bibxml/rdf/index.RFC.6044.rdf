        <title>RFC 6044: Mapping and Interworking of Diversion Information between Diversion and History-Info Headers in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), M. Mohali</title>
        <dc:date>2010-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Since the Diversion header is used in many existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed.  This work is intended to enable the migration from non- standard implementations and deployment toward IETF specification- based implementations and deployment.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
