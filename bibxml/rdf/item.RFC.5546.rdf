        <title>RFC 5546: iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP), C. Daboo</title>
        <dc:date>2009-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) complements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics for group scheduling methods commonly available in current calendaring systems.  These scheduling methods permit two or more calendaring systems to perform transactions such as publishing, scheduling, rescheduling, responding to scheduling requests, negotiating changes, or canceling.
