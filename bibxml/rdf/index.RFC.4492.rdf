        <title>RFC 4492: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS), S. Blake-Wilson, N. Bolyard, V. Gupta, C. Hawk, B. Moeller</title>
        <dc:date>2006-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes new key exchange algorithms based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  In particular, it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as a new authentication mechanism.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
