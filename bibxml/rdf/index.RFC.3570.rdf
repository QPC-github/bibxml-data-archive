        <dc:date>2003-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for use in production networks, it is useful to provide examples of the sequence of events that may occur when two content networks decide to interconnect.  The scenarios presented here seek to provide some concrete examples of what content internetworking is, and also to provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking proposals.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
