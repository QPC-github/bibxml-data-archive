        <title>RFC 7054: Addressing Requirements and Design Considerations for Per-Interface Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs), A. Farrel, H. Endo, R. Winter, Y. Koike, M. Paul</title>

        <description>This document elaborates on important considerations for internal MIP addressing.  More precisely, it describes important restrictions for any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that they can be targeted at MIPs on either incoming or outgoing interfaces and forwarded correctly through the forwarding engine.  Furthermore, the document includes considerations for node implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming and outgoing MIP. </description>
