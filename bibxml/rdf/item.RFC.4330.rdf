        <title>RFC 4330: Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI, D. Mills</title>
        <dc:date>2006-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1769, which describes SNTP Version 3 (SNTPv3), and RFC 2030, which describes SNTPv4.  Its purpose is to correct certain inconsistencies in the previous documents and to clarify header formats and protocol operations for NTPv3 (IPv4) and SNTPv4 (IPv4, IPv6, and OSI), which are also used for SNTP.  A further purpose is to provide guidance for home and business client implementations for routers and other consumer devices to protect the server population from abuse.  A working knowledge of the NTPv3 specification, RFC 1305, is not required for an implementation of SNTP.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
