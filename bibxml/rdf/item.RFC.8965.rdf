        <title>RFC 8965: Applicability of the Babel Routing Protocol, J. Chroboczek</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Babel is a routing protocol based on the distance-vector algorithm augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance and starvation avoidance. This document describes a number of niches where Babel has been found to be useful and that are arguably not adequately served by more mature protocols. </description>
