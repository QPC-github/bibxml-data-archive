        <title>RFC 4881: Low-Latency Handoffs in Mobile IPv4, K. El Malki</title>
        <dc:date>2007-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Mobile IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform IPv4-layer handoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents.  In certain cases, the latency involved in these handoffs can be above the threshold required for the support of delay-sensitive or real-time services.  The aim of this document is to present two methods to achieve low-latency Mobile IPv4 handoffs.  In addition, a combination of these two methods is described.  The described techniques allow greater support for real-time services on a Mobile IPv4 network by minimizing the period of time when a Mobile Node is unable to send or receive IPv4 packets due to the delay in the Mobile IPv4 Registration process.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
