        <title>RFC 5782: DNS Blacklists and Whitelists, J. Levine</title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses or domains.  The DNS has become the de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists and whitelists.  This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS-based blacklists and whitelists, and the protocol used to query them.  This document  is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes. </description>
