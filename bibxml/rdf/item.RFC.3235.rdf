        <dc:date>2002-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses those things that application designers might wish to consider when designing new protocols.  While many common Internet applications will operate cleanly in the presence of Network Address Translators, others suffer from a variety of problems when crossing these devices.  Guidelines are presented herein to help ensure new protocols and applications will, to the extent possible, be compatible with NAT (Network Address Translation).  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
