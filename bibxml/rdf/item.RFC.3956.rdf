        <title>RFC 3956: Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address, P. Savola, B. Haberman</title>
        <dc:date>2004-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines an address allocation policy in which the address of the Rendezvous Point (RP) is encoded in an IPv6 multicast group address.  For Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), this can be seen as a specification of a group-to-RP mapping mechanism.  This allows an easy deployment of scalable inter-domain multicast and simplifies the intra-domain multicast configuration as well.  This memo updates the addressing format presented in RFC 3306.
