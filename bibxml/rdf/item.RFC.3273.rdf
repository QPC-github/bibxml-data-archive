        <title>RFC 3273: Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base for High Capacity Networks, S. Waldbusser</title>
        <dc:date>2002-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing remote network monitoring (RMON) devices for use on high speed networks.  This document contains a MIB Module that defines these new objects and also contains definitions of some updated objects from the RMON-MIB in RFC 2819 and the RMON2-MIB in RFC 2021.  [PROPOSED STANDARD] </description>
