        <description>This document provides a model for the network entities that take part in such signaling, and for the relationship between signaling and the rest of network operation.  We decompose the overall signaling protocol suite into a generic (lower) layer, with separate upper layers for each specific signaling application.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
