        <title>RFC 8309: Service Models Explained, Q. Wu, W. Liu, A. Farrel</title>
        <dc:date>2018-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes service models as used within the IETF and also shows where a service model might fit into a software-defined networking architecture.  Note that service models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed through the interface between the customer and the provider. </description>
