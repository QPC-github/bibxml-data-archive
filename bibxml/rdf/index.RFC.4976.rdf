        <title>RFC 4976: Relay Extensions for the Message Sessions Relay Protocol (MSRP), C. Jennings, R. Mahy, A. B. Roach</title>
        <dc:date>2007-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Two separate models for conveying instant messages have been defined. Page-mode messages stand alone and are not part of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session, whereas session-mode messages are set up as part of a session using SIP.  The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) is a protocol for near real-time, peer-to-peer exchanges of binary content without intermediaries, which is designed to be signaled using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP.  This document introduces the notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP and describes the extensions necessary to use them.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
