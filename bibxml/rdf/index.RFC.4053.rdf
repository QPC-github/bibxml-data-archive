        <title>RFC 4053: Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF, S. Trowbridge, S. Bradner, F. Baker</title>
        <dc:date>2005-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> The IETF expects that liaison statements might come from a variety of organizations, and it may choose to respond to many of those.  The IETF is only obligated to respond if there is an agreed liaison relationship, however.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
