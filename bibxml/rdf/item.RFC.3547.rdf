        <description>This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for group key management to support secure group communications.  The GDOI manages group security associations, which are used by IPSEC and potentially other data security protocols running at the IP or application layers.  These security associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group members.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
