        <title>RFC 0950: Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure, J.C. Mogul, J. Postel</title>
        <dc:date>1985-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which    are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For    administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to    divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a    set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the    use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).    The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully    described.  Important motivation and background information for a    subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a    protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented    it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed. </description>
