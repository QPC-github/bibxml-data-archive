        <title>RFC 2970: Architecture for Integrated Directory Services - Result from TISDAG, L. Daigle, T. Eklof</title>
        <dc:date>2000-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Drawing from experiences with the TISDAG (Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways) project, this document outlines an approach to providing the necessary infrastructure for integrating such widely-scattered servers into a single service, rather than attempting to mandate a single protocol and schema set for all participating servers to use.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
