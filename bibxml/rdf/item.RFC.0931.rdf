        <dc:date>1985-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is the    second draft of this proposal (superseding RFC-912) and incorporates a    more formal description of the syntax for the request and response    dialog, as well as a change to specify the type of user identification    returned. </description>
