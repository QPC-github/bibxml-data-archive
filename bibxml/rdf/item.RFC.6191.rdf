        <title>RFC 6191: Reducing the TIME-WAIT State Using TCP Timestamps, F. Gont</title>
        <dc:date>2011-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an algorithm for processing incoming SYN segments that allows higher connection-establishment rates between any two TCP endpoints when a TCP Timestamps option is present in the incoming SYN segment.  This document only modifies processing of SYN segments received for connections in the TIME-WAIT state; processing in all other states is unchanged.  This memo documents an Internet  Best Current Practice. </description>
