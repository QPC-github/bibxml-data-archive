        <title>RFC 1520: Exchanging Routing Information Across Provider Boundaries in the CIDR Environment, Y. Rekhter, C. Topolcic</title>
        <dc:date>1993-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this document is twofold. First, it describes various alternatives for exchanging inter-domain routing information across domain boundaries, where one of the peering domain is CIDR-capable and another is not.  Second, it addresses the implications of running CIDR- capable inter-domain routing protocols (e.g., BGP-4, IDRP) on intra- domain routing.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
