        <title>RFC 4636: Foreign Agent Error Extension for Mobile IPv4, C. Perkins</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents operating Mobile IP for IPv4.  Currently, a foreign agent cannot supply status information without destroying the ability for a mobile node to verify authentication data supplied by the home agent.  The new extension solves this problem by making a better place for the foreign agent to provide its status information to the mobile node.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
