        <title>RFC 9039: Uniform Resource Names for Device Identifiers, J. Arkko, C. Jennings, Z. Shelby</title>
        <dc:date>2021-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for hardware device identifiers. A general representation of device identity can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage or in equipment inventories. A URN-based representation can be passed along in applications that need the information. </description>
