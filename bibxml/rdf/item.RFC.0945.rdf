        <title>RFC 0945: DoD statement on the NRC report, J. Postel</title>
        <dc:date>1985-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In May 1983 the National Research Council (NRC) was asked jointly by DoD    and NBS to study the issues and recommend a course of action.  The final    report of the NRC committee was published in February 1985 (see    RFC-942). The enclosed letter is from Donald C. Latham (ASDC3I) to DCA    transmitting the NRC report and requesting specific actions relative to    the recommendations of the report.  This RFC reproduces a letter from the    Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and    Intelligence (ASDC3I) to the Director of the Defense Communications Agency    (DCA).  This letter is distributed for information only. </description>
