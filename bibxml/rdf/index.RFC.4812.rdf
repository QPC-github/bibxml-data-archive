        <title>RFC 4812: OSPF Restart Signaling, L. Nguyen, A. Roy, A. Zinin</title>
        <dc:date>2007-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism that allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process.  Note that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.  The mechanism described in this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in RFC 3623, came into existence.  It is implemented/supported by at least one major vendor and is currently deployed in the field.  The purpose of this document is to capture the details of this mechanism for public use.  This mechanism is not an IETF standard.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
