        <title>RFC 6308: Overview of the Internet Multicast Addressing Architecture, P. Savola</title>
        <dc:date>2011-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The lack of up-to-date documentation on IP multicast address allocation and assignment procedures has caused a great deal of confusion.  To clarify the situation, this memo describes the allocation and assignment techniques and mechanisms currently (as of this writing) in use.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
