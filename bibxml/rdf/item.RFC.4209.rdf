        <title>RFC 4209: Link Management Protocol (LMP) for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Optical Line Systems, A. Fredette, J. Lang</title>
        <dc:date>2005-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is defined to manage traffic engineering (TE) links.  In its present form, LMP focuses on peer nodes, i.e., nodes that peer in signaling and/or routing.  This document proposes extensions to LMP to allow it to be used between a peer node and an adjacent optical line system (OLS).  These extensions are intended to satisfy the "Optical Link Interface Requirements" described in a companion document.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
