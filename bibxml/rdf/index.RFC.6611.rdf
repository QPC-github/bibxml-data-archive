        <title>RFC 6611: Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) Bootstrapping for the Integrated Scenario, K. Chowdhury, A. Yegin</title>
        <dc:date>2012-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping can be categorized into two primary scenarios: the split scenario and the integrated scenario.  In the split scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is authorized by a different service authorizer than the network access authorizer.  In the integrated scenario, the mobile node's mobility service is authorized by the same service authorizer as the network access service authorizer.  This document defines a method for home agent information discovery for the integrated scenario.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
