        <description>Hosts in an IP network are identified by IP addresses, and the IP address prefixes of subnets are advertised by routing protocols.  A change in such IP addressing information associated with a host or subnet is known as "renumbering".  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
