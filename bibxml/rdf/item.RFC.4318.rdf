        <title>RFC 4318: Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges with Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, D. Levi, D. Harrington</title>
        <dc:date>2005-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines an SMIv2 MIB module for managing the Rapid Spanning Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t and P802.1w amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.  The objects in this MIB are defined to apply both to transparent bridging and to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
