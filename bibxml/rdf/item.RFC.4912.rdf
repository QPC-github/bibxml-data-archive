        <title>RFC 4912: Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X), S. Legg</title>
        <dc:date>2007-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is a semantically equivalent Extensible Markup Language (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specifications. ASN.X completely avoids the numerous ambiguities inherent in the ASN.1 language; therefore, specifications written in ASN.X are much easier to parse and manage than original ASN.1 specifications.  ASN.X, together with the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), constitutes a schema language for XML documents that offers, through other ASN.1 encoding rules, alternative compact binary encodings for XML instance documents.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
