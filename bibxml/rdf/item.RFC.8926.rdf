        <title>RFC 8926: Geneve: Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation, J. Gross, I. Ganga, T. Sridhar</title>
        <dc:date>2020-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a result of their role in tying together different elements of the system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these components.  Therefore, flexibility is the most important aspect of a tunneling protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of technology. This document describes Geneve, an encapsulation protocol designed to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs. </description>
