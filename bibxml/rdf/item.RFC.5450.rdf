        <title>RFC 5450: Transmission Time Offsets in RTP Streams, D. Singer, H. Desineni</title>
        <dc:date>2009-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a method to inform Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) clients when RTP packets are transmitted at a time other than their 'nominal' transmission time.  It also provides a mechanism to provide improved inter-arrival jitter reports from the clients, that take into account the reported transmission times.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
