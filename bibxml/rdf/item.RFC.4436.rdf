        <title>RFC 4436: Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4), B. Aboba, J. Carlson, S. Cheshire</title>
        <dc:date>2006-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The time required to detect movement between networks and to obtain (or to continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a fraction of the total handover latency in moving between points of attachment.  This document synthesizes, from experience in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP, and IPv4 Link-Local addresses, a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving between points of attachment.
