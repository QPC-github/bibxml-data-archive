        <title>RFC 8156: DHCPv6 Failover Protocol, T. Mrugalski, K. Kinnear</title>
        <dc:date>2017-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DHCPv6 as defined in "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6                        (DHCPv6)" (RFC 3315) does not offer server redundancy.  This document defines a protocol implementation to provide DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for running two servers with the capability for either server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or network partition.  It meets the requirements for DHCPv6 failover detailed in "DHCPv6 Failover Requirements" (RFC 7031). </description>
