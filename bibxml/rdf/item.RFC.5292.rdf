        <title>RFC 5292: Address-Prefix-Based Outbound Route Filter for BGP-4, E. Chen, S. Sangli</title>
        <dc:date>2008-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP, termed "Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to perform address-prefix-based route filtering.  This ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild-card-based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching for address families.
