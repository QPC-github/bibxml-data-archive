        <title>RFC 7416: A Security Threat Analysis for the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPLs), T. Tsao, R. Alexander, M. Dohler, V. Daza, A. Lozano, M. Richardson</title>

        <description>This document presents a security threat analysis for the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPLs).  The development builds upon previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are addressed in relevant applicability statements. </description>
