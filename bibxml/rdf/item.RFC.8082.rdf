        <title>RFC 8082: Using Codec Control Messages in the RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback with Layered Codecs, S. Wenger, J. Lennox, B. Burman, M. Westerlund</title>
        <dc:date>2017-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates RFC 5104 by fixing a shortcoming in the specification language of the Codec Control Message Full Intra Request (FIR) description when using it with layered codecs.  In particular, a decoder refresh point needs to be sent by a media sender when a FIR is received on any layer of the layered bitstream, regardless of whether those layers are being sent in a single or in multiple RTP flows.  The other payload-specific feedback messages defined in RFC 5104 and RFC 4585 (which was updated by RFC 5506) have also been analyzed, and no corresponding shortcomings have been found. </description>
