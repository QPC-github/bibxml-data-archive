        <title>RFC 6763: DNS-Based Service Discovery, S. Cheshire, M. Krochmal</title>
        <dc:date>2013-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured to facilitate service discovery.  Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using standard DNS queries. This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD. </description>
