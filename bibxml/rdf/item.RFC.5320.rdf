        <title>RFC 5320: The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL), F. Templin</title>
        <dc:date>2010-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>For the purpose of this document, subnetworks are defined as virtual topologies that span connected network regions bounded by encapsulating border nodes.  These virtual topologies may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops, and can introduce failure modes due to packet duplication and/or links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs).  This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that accommodates such virtual topologies over diverse underlying link technologies.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol  for the Internet community. </description>
