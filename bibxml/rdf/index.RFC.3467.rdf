        <title>RFC 3467: Role of the Domain Name System (DNS), J. Klensin</title>
        <dc:date>2003-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document reviews the original function and purpose of the domain name system (DNS).  It contrasts that history with some of the purposes for which the DNS has recently been applied and some of the newer demands being placed upon it or suggested for it.  A framework for an alternative to placing these additional stresses on the DNS is then outlined.  This document and that framework are not a proposed solution, only a strong suggestion that the time has come to begin thinking more broadly about the problems we are encountering and possible approaches to solving them.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
