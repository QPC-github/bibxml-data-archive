        <title>RFC 1808: Relative Uniform Resource Locators, R. Fielding</title>
        <dc:date>1995-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In situations where the base URL is well-defined and known to the parser (human or machine), it is useful to be able to embed URL references which inherit that context rather than re-specifying it in every instance.  This document defines the syntax and semantics for such Relative Uniform Resource Locators.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
