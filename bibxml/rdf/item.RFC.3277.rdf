        <title>RFC 3277: Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Transient Blackhole Avoidance, D. McPherson</title>
        <dc:date>2002-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can be employed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) networks in order to decrease the data loss associated with deterministic blackholing of packets during transient network conditions.  The mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS protocol changes and is completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS specification.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
