        <title>RFC 7628: A Set of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanisms for OAuth, W. Mills, T. Showalter, H. Tschofenig</title>

        <description>Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a shared secret with higher entropy, i.e., the token.  Tokens typically provide limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term password. </description>
