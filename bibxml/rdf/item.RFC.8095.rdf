        <title>RFC 8095: Services Provided by IETF Transport Protocols and Congestion Control Mechanisms, G. Fairhurst, B. Trammell, M. Kuehlewind</title>
        <dc:date>2017-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes, surveys, and classifies the protocol mechanisms provided by existing IETF protocols, as background for determining a common set of transport services.  It examines the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Multipath TCP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), UDP-Lite, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport / Asynchronous Layered Coding (FLUTE/ALC) for Reliable Multicast, NACK- Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Datagram TLS (DTLS), and the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), when HTTP is used as a pseudotransport.  This survey provides background for the definition of transport services within the TAPS working group. </description>
