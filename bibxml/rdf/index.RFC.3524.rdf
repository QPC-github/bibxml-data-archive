        <title>RFC 3524: Mapping of Media Streams to Resource Reservation Flows, G. Camarillo, A. Monrad</title>
        <dc:date>2003-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines an extension to the Session Description Protocol (SDP) grouping framework.  It allows requesting a group of media streams to be mapped into a single resource reservation flow.  The SDP syntax needed is defined, as well as a new "semantics" attribute called Single Reservation Flow (SRF).  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
