        <title>RFC 0831: Backup access to the European side of SATNET, R.T. Braden</title>
        <dc:date>1982-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular Internet problem:  a backup path for software maintenance of the European sector of the Internet, for use when SATNET is partitioned.  We propose a mechanism, based upon the Source Routing option of IP, to reach European Internet sites via the VAN Gateway and UCL.  This proposal is not intended as a standard at this time. </description>
