        <title>RFC 2069: An Extension to HTTP : Digest Access Authentication, J. Franks, P. Hallam-Baker, J. Hostetler, P. Leach, A. Luotonen, E. Sink, L. Stewart</title>

        <description>The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes the specification for a Basic Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the network as clear text.  A specification for a different authentication scheme is needed to address this severe limitation.  This document provides specification for such a scheme, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication".  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
