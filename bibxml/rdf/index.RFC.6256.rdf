        <title>RFC 6256: Using Self-Delimiting Numeric Values in Protocols, W. Eddy, E. Davies</title>
        <dc:date>2011-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
