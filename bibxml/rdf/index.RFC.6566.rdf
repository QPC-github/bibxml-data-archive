        <title>RFC 6566: A Framework for the Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs) with Impairments, Y. Lee, G. Bernstein, D. Li, G. Martinelli</title>
        <dc:date>2012-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a framework for applying GMPLS protocols and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to support Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength switched optical networks.  Specifically, this document discusses key computing constraints, scenarios, and architectural processes: routing, wavelength assignment, and impairment validation.  This document does not define optical data plane aspects; impairment parameters; or measurement of, or assessment and qualification of, a route; rather, it describes the architectural and information components for protocol solutions.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
