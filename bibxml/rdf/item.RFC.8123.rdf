        <title>RFC 8123: Requirements for Marking SIP Messages to be Logged, P. Dawes, C. Arunachalam</title>
        <dc:date>2017-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging.  Such a marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular client signaling.  However, such a marking can be carried end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and terminates in different networks. </description>
