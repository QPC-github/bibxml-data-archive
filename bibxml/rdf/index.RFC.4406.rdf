        <title>RFC 4406: Sender ID: Authenticating E-Mail, J. Lyon, M. Wong</title>
        <dc:date>2006-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent using spoofed addresses -- "spoofed" in this case means that the address is used without the permission of the domain owner.  This document describes a family of tests by which SMTP servers can determine whether an e-mail address in a received message was used with the permission of the owner of the domain contained in that e-mail address.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
