        <title>RFC 4709: Mounting Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Servers, J. Reschke</title>
        <dc:date>2006-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a mechanism and a document format that enables WebDAV servers to send "mounting" information to a WebDAV client.  The mechanism is designed to work on any platform and with any combination of browser and WebDAV client, relying solely on the well-understood dispatch of documents through their MIME type.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
