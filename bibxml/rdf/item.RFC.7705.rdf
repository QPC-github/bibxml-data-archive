        <title>RFC 7705: Autonomous System Migration Mechanisms and Their Effects on the BGP AS_PATH Attribute, W. George, S. Amante</title>
        <dc:date>2015-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses some existing commonly used BGP mechanisms for Autonomous System Number (ASN) migration that are not formally part of the BGP4 protocol specification.  It is necessary to document these de facto standards to ensure that they are properly supported in future BGP protocol work. </description>
