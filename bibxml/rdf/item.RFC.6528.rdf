        <title>RFC 6528: Defending against Sequence Number Attacks, F. Gont, S. Bellovin</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path attacker guessing the sequence numbers in use by a target connection are reduced.  This document revises (and formally obsoletes) RFC 1948, and takes the ISN generation algorithm originally proposed in that document to Standards Track, formally updating RFC 793.
