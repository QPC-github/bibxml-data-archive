        <title>RFC 8747: Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs), M. Jones, L. Seitz, G. Selander, S. Erdtman, H. Tschofenig</title>
        <dc:date>2020-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT) (which is defined by RFC 8392) that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as being the holder-of-key. This specification provides equivalent functionality to "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800) but using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CWTs rather than JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). </description>
