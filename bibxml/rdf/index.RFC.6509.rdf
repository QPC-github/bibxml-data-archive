        <title>RFC 6509: MIKEY-SAKKE: Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY), M. Groves</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Multimedia Internet KEYing-Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (MIKEY-SAKKE), a method of key exchange that uses Identity-based Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value and certificateless signatures to provide source authentication.  MIKEY-SAKKE has a number of desirable features, including simplex transmission, scalability, low-latency call setup, and support for secure deferred delivery.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
