        <title>RFC 5055: Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP), T. Freeman, R. Housley, A. Malpani, D. Cooper, W. Polk</title>
        <dc:date>2007-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) allows a client to delegate certification path construction and certification path validation to a server.  The path construction or validation (e.g., making sure that none of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a validation policy, which contains one or more trust anchors.  It allows simplification of client implementations and use of a set of predefined validation policies.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
