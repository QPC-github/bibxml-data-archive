        <description>This memo documents IETF consensus for Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) derived character properties related to the three code points, existing in Unicode 5.2, that changed property values when version 6.0 was released.  The consensus is that no update is needed to RFC 5892 based on the changes made in Unicode 6.0.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
