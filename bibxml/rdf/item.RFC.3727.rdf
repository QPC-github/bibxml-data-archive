        <title>RFC 3727: ASN.1 Module Definition for the LDAP and X.500 Component Matching Rules, S. Legg</title>
        <dc:date>2004-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates the specification of the component matching rules for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 directories (RFC3687) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) definitions of the component matching rules into an appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other specifications may reference the component matching rule definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.
