        <title>RFC 8583: Diameter Load Information Conveyance, B. Campbell, S. Donovan, JJ. Trottin</title>
        <dc:date>2019-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter. This includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send "load" information, even when the node is not overloaded.  The base solution defined in RFC 7683 (Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC)) describes a mechanism meeting most of the requirements but does not currently include the ability to send load information.  This document defines a mechanism for the conveying of Diameter load information. </description>
