        <title>RFC 3182: Identity Representation for RSVP, S. Yadav, R. Yavatkar, R. Pabbati, P. Ford, T. Moore, S. Herzog, R. Hess</title>

        <description>This document describes the representation of identity information in POLICY_DATA object for supporting policy based admission control in the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP).  The goal of identity representation is to allow a process on a system to securely identify the owner and the application of the communicating process (e.g., user id) and convey this information in RSVP messages (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner.  We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP policy element.  We describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements for multicast merged flows.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
