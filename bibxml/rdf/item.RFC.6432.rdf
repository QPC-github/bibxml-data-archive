        <title>RFC 6432: Carrying Q.850 Codes in Reason Header Fields in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Responses, R. Jesske, L. Liess</title>
        <dc:date>2011-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Although the use of the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Reason header field in responses is considered in general in RFC 3326, its use is not specified for any particular response code.  Nonetheless, existing deployments have been using Reason header fields to carry failure-related Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses to INVITE requests that have been gatewayed to Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) systems.  This document normatively describes the use of the Reason header field in carrying Q.850 cause codes in SIP responses.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
