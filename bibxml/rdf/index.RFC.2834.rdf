        <title>RFC 2834: ARP and IP Broadcast over HIPPI-800, J.-M. Pittet</title>
        <dc:date>2000-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to ANSI High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) hardware addresses and for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension of HARP (hardware addresses).  This memo defines a HARP that will interoperate between HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 (also known as Gigabyte System Network, GSN).  This document (when combined with RFC 2067 "IP over HIPPI") obsoletes RFC 1374.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
