        <title>RFC 4174: The IPv4 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Option for the Internet Storage Name Service, C. Monia, J. Tseng, K. Gibbons</title>
        <dc:date>2005-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option to allow Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) clients to discover the location of the iSNS server automatically through the use of DHCP for IPv4.  iSNS provides discovery and management capabilities for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) storage devices in an enterprise-scale IP storage network.  iSNS provides intelligent storage management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a similar capacity to that of a storage area network.
