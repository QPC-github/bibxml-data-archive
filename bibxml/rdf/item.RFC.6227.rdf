        <title>RFC 6227: Design Goals for Scalable Internet Routing, T. Li</title>
        <dc:date>2011-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing architecture is facing challenges in scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain traffic engineering.  The Routing Research Group is investigating an alternate architecture to meet these challenges.  This document consists of a prioritized list of design goals for the target architecture.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
