        <title>RFC 5691: RTP Payload Format for Elementary Streams with MPEG Surround Multi-Channel Audio, F. de Bont, S. Doehla, M. Schmidt, R. Sperschneider</title>
        <dc:date>2009-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes extensions for the RTP payload format defined in RFC 3640 for the transport of MPEG Surround multi-channel audio. Additional Media Type parameters are defined to signal backwards- compatible transmission inside an MPEG-4 Audio elementary stream.  In addition, a layered transmission scheme that doesn't use the MPEG-4 systems framework is presented to transport an MPEG Surround elementary stream via RTP in parallel with an RTP stream containing the downmixed audio data.
