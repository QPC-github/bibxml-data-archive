        <dc:date>2008-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document registers the Enumservice named "vmsg", which is used to facilitate the real-time routing of voice, video, and unified communications to a messaging system.  This vmsg Enumservice registers three Enumservice types: "voicemsg", "videomsg", and "unifmsg".  Each type also registers the subtypes "sip", "sips", "http", and "https", as well as the subtype "tel" for the "voicemsg" type.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
