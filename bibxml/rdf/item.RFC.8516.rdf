        <title>RFC 8516: "Too Many Requests" Response Code for the Constrained Application Protocol, A. Keranen</title>
        <dc:date>2019-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience temporary overload because one or more clients are sending requests to the server at a higher rate than the server is capable or willing to handle.  This document defines a new CoAP response code for a server to indicate that a client should reduce the rate of requests. </description>
