        <title>RFC 4679: DSL Forum Vendor-Specific RADIUS Attributes, V. Mammoliti, G. Zorn, P. Arberg, R. Rennison</title>
        <dc:date>2006-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>These attributes are designed to transport Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) information that is not supported by the standard RADIUS attribute set.  It is expected that this document will be updated if and when the DSL Forum defines additional vendor-specific attributes, since its primary purpose is to provide a reference for DSL equipment vendors wishing to interoperate with other vendors' products.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
