        <title>RFC 3987: Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), M. Duerst, M. Suignard</title>
        <dc:date>2005-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition of URIs.  This was done in order  to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with  existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal with URIs. </description>
