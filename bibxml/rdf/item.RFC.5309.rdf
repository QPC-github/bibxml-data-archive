        <title>RFC 5309: Point-to-Point Operation over LAN in Link State Routing Protocols, N. Shen, A. Zinin</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The two predominant circuit types used by link state routing protocols are point-to-point and broadcast.  It is important to identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and representing the circuit topologically.  This document describes a simple mechanism to treat the broadcast network as a point-to-point connection from the standpoint of IP routing.  This memo provides information for the  Internet community. </description>
