        <title>RFC 6565: OSPFv3 as a Provider Edge to Customer Edge (PE-CE) Routing Protocol, P. Pillay-Esnault, P. Moyer, J. Doyle, E. Ertekin, M. Lundberg</title>
        <dc:date>2012-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers.  The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone.  Support currently exists for both IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs; however, only Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) as PE-CE protocol is specified.  This document extends those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing protocol.  The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to that of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
