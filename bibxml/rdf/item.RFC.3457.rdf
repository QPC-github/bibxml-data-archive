        <title>RFC 3457: Requirements for IPsec Remote Access Scenarios, S. Kelly, S. Ramamoorthi</title>
        <dc:date>2003-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IPsec offers much promise as a secure remote access mechanism.  However, there are a number of differing remote access scenarios, each having some shared and some unique requirements.  A thorough understanding of these requirements is necessary in order to effectively evaluate the suitability of a specific set of mechanisms for any particular remote access scenario.  This document enumerates the requirements for a number of common remote access scenarios.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
