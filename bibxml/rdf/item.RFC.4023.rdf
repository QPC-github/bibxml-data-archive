        <title>RFC 4023: Encapsulating MPLS in IP or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), T. Worster, Y. Rekhter, E. Rosen</title>
        <dc:date>2005-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Various applications of MPLS make use of label stacks with multiple entries.  In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack with an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks that do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers.  This document specifies two IP-based encapsulations: MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation).  Each of these is applicable in some circumstances. [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
