        <title>RFC 7279: An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes, M. Shore, C. Pignataro</title>
        <dc:date>2014-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted a need to describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable and when it is not. </description>
