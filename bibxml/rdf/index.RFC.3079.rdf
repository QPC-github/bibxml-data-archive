        <title>RFC 3079: Deriving Keys for use with Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), G. Zorn</title>
        <dc:date>2001-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the method used to derive initial MPPE session keys from a variety of credential types.  It is expected that this memo will be updated whenever Microsoft defines a new key derivation method for MPPE, since its primary purpose is to provide an open, easily accessible reference for third-parties wishing to interoperate with Microsoft products.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
