        <dc:date>1985-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC reproduces the material from the "front pages" of the National    Research Council report resulting from a study of the DOD Internet    Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in comparison with    the ISO Internet Protocol (ISO-IP) and Transport Protocol level 4    (TP-4).  The point of this RFC is to make the text of the Executive    Summary widely available in a timely way.  The order of presentation has    been altered, and the pagination changed.  This RFC is distributed for    information only.  This RFC does not establish any policy for the DARPA    research community or the DDN operational community. </description>
