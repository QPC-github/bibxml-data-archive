        <title>RFC 1498: On the Naming and Binding of Network Destinations, J. Saltzer</title>
        <dc:date>1993-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This brief paper offers a perspective on the subject of names of destinations in data communication networks. It suggests two ideas: First, it is helpful to distinguish among four different kinds of objects that may be named as the destination of a packet in a network. Second, the operating system concept of binding is a useful way to describe the relations among the four kinds of objects.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard. </description>
