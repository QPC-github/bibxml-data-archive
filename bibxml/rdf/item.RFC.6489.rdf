        <title>RFC 6489: Certification Authority (CA) Key Rollover in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), G. Huston, G. Michaelson, S. Kent</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how a Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) performs a planned rollover of its key pair.  This document also notes the implications of this key rollover procedure for relying parties (RPs).  In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache of the objects that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way in which a CA performs key rollover impacts RPs.  This memo documents an Internet  Best Current Practice. </description>
