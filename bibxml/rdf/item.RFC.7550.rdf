        <title>RFC 7550: Issues and Recommendations with Multiple Stateful DHCPv6 Options, O. Troan, B. Volz, M. Siodelski</title>
        <dc:date>2015-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specification defined two stateful options, IA_NA and IA_TA, but did not anticipate the development of additional stateful options. DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation added the IA_PD option, which is stateful. Applications that use IA_NA and IA_PD together have revealed issues that need to be addressed.  This document updates RFCs 3315 and 3633 to address these issues. </description>
