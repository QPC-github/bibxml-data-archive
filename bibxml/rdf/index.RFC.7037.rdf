        <title>RFC 7037: RADIUS Option for the DHCPv6 Relay Agent, L. Yeh, M. Boucadair</title>
        <dc:date>2013-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange authorization and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay agent and DHCPv6 server.  This architecture assumes that the Network Access Server (NAS) acts as both a DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client.  When receiving messages from the DHCPv6 clients, the NAS consults the RADIUS server and adds the RADIUS response when forwarding the DHCPv6 client's messages to the DHCPv6 server.  The DHCPv6 server then uses that additional information to generate an appropriate response to the DHCPv6 client's requests. </description>
