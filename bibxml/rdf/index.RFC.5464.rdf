        <title>RFC 5464: The IMAP METADATA Extension, C. Daboo</title>
        <dc:date>2009-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The METADATA extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits clients and servers to maintain "annotations" or "metadata" on IMAP servers.  It is possible to have annotations on a per-mailbox basis or on the server as a whole.  For example, this would allow comments about the purpose of a particular mailbox to be "attached" to that mailbox, or a "message of the day" containing server status information to be made available to anyone logging in to the server.
