        <title>RFC 7688: GMPLS OSPF Enhancement for Signal and Network Element Compatibility for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks, Y. Lee, G. Bernstein</title>
        <dc:date>2015-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical or hybrid electro-optical systems such as optical-electronic-optical (OEO) switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters, since such systems can be limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals. </description>
