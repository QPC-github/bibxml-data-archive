        <title>RFC 0922: Broadcasting Internet datagrams in the presence of subnets, J.C. Mogul</title>
        <dc:date>1984-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>We propose simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on local    networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and for how    gateways should handle them. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for    the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements. </description>
