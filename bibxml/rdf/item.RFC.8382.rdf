        <title>RFC 8382: Shared Bottleneck Detection for Coupled Congestion Control for RTP Media, D. Hayes, S. Ferlin, M. Welzl, K. Hiorth</title>
        <dc:date>2018-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a mechanism to detect whether end-to-end data flows share a common bottleneck.  This mechanism relies on summary statistics that are calculated based on continuous measurements and used as input to a grouping algorithm that runs wherever the knowledge is needed. </description>
