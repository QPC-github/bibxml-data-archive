        <title>RFC 2835: IP and ARP over HIPPI-6400 (GSN), J.-M. Pittet</title>
        <dc:date>2000-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document further specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to HIPPI-6400 (High-Performance Parallel Interface) hardware addresses (HARP) and for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension of HARP.  Furthermore, it is the goal of this memo to define a IP and HARP that will allow interoperability for HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 equipment both broadcast and non-broadcast capable networks.
