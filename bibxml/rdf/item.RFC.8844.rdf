        <title>RFC 8844: Unknown Key-Share Attacks on Uses of TLS with the Session Description Protocol (SDP), M. Thomson, E. Rescorla</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP). Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be misled about the identity of a communicating peer.  This document defines mitigation techniques that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy. </description>
