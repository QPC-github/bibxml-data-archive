        <dc:date>2004-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>

This document is based on the printer attributes listed in Appendix E of Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (IPP) (RFC 2911).  A few additional printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB (RFC 1759).  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
