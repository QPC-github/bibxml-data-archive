        <title>RFC 8963: Evaluation of a Sample of RFCs Produced in 2018, C. Huitema</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. Counting web references could complement that. </description>
