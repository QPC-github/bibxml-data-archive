        <title>RFC 5617: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP), E. Allman, J. Fenton, M. Delany, J. Levine</title>
        <dc:date>2009-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication framework for email to permit verification of the source and contents of messages.  This document specifies an adjunct mechanism to aid in assessing messages that do not contain a DKIM signature for the domain used in the author's address.  It defines a record that can advertise whether a domain signs its outgoing mail as well as how other hosts can access that record.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
