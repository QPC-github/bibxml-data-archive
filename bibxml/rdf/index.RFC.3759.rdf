        <title>RFC 3759: RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Terminology and Channel Mapping Examples, L-E. Jonsson</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document aims to clarify terms and concepts presented in RFC 3095.  RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for RObust Header Compression (ROHC).  The standard introduces various concepts which might be difficult to understand and especially to relate correctly to the surrounding environments where header compression may be used.  This document aims at clarifying these aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHC instances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, and ROHC contexts, and how these terms relate to other terms, like network elements and IP interfaces, commonly used, for example, when addressing MIB issues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
