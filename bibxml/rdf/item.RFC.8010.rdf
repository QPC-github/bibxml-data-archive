        <title>RFC 8010: Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport, M. Sweet, I. McDonald</title>
        <dc:date>2017-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document defines the rules for encoding IPP operations, attributes, and values into the Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp".  It also defines the rules for transporting a message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp" over HTTP and/or HTTPS.  The IPP data model and operation semantics are described in "Internet                                      Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" (RFC 8011). </description>
