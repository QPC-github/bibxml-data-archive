        <title>RFC 5878: Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Extensions, M. Brown, R. Housley</title>
        <dc:date>2010-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies authorization extensions to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol.  Extensions are carried in the client and server hello messages to confirm that both parties support the desired authorization data types.  Then, if supported by both the client and the server, authorization information, such as attribute certificates (ACs) or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)  assertions, is exchanged in the supplemental data handshake message. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
