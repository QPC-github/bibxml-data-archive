        <title>RFC 8376: Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) Overview, S. Farrell</title>
        <dc:date>2018-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are wireless technologies with characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth, possibly very small packet and application-layer data sizes, and long battery life operation.  This memo is an informational overview of the set of LPWAN technologies being considered in the IETF and of the gaps that exist between the needs of those technologies and the goal of running IP in LPWANs. </description>
