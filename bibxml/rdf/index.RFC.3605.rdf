        <title>RFC 3605: Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) attribute in Session Description Protocol (SDP), C. Huitema</title>
        <dc:date>2003-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is used to describe the parameters of media streams used in multimedia sessions.  When a session requires multiple ports, SDP assumes that these ports have consecutive numbers.  However, when the session crosses a network address translation device that also uses port mapping, the ordering of ports can be destroyed by the translation.  To handle this, we propose an extension attribute to SDP. </description>
