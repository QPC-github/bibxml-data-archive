        <title>RFC 4110: A Framework for Layer 3 Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs), R. Callon, M. Suzuki</title>
        <dc:date>2005-07-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document provides a framework for Layer 3 Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs).  This framework is intended to aid in the standardization of protocols and mechanisms for support of layer 3 PPVPNs.  It is the intent of this document to produce a coherent description of the significant technical issues that are important in the design of layer 3 PPVPN solutions.  Selection of specific approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs, and detailed protocol specification, are outside of the scope of this framework document.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
