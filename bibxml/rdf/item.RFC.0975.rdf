        <title>RFC 0975: Autonomous confederations, D.L. Mills</title>
        <dc:date>1986-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This RFC proposes enhancements to the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) to    support a simple, multiple-level routing capability while preserving the    robustness features of the current EGP model.  The enhancements    generalize the concept of core system to include multiple communities of    autonomous systems, called autonomous confederations.  Discussion and    suggestions for improvement are requested. </description>
