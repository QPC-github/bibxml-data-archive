        <title>RFC 3723: Securing Block Storage Protocols over IP, B. Aboba, J. Tseng, J. Walker, V. Rangan, F. Travostino</title>
        <dc:date>2004-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document discusses how to secure block storage and storage discovery protocols running over IP (Internet Protocol) using IPsec and IKE (Internet Key Exchange).  Threat models and security protocols are developed for iSCSI (Internet Protocol Small Computer System Interface), iFCP (Internet Fibre Channel Storage Networking) and FCIP (Fibre Channel over TCP/IP), as well as the iSNS (Internet Storage Name Server) and SLPv2 (Service Location Protocol v2) discovery protocols.  Performance issues and resource constraints are analyzed.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
