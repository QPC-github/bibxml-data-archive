        <title>RFC 1029: More fault tolerant approach to address resolution for a Multi-LAN system of Ethernets, G. Parr</title>
        <dc:date>1988-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses an extension to a Bridge Protocol to detect and disclose changes in heighbouring host address parameters in a Multi-Lan system of Ethernets.  The problem is one which is appearing more and more regularly as the interconnected systems grow larger on Campuses and in Commercial Institutions.  This RFC suggests a protocol enhancement for the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
