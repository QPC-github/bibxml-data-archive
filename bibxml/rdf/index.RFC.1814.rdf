        <title>RFC 1814: Unique Addresses are Good, E. Gerich</title>
        <dc:date>1995-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IAB suggests that while RFC 1597 establishes reserved IP address space for the use of private networks which are isolated and will remain isolated from the Internet, any enterprise which anticipates external connectivity to the Internet should apply for a globally unique address from an Internet registry or service provider.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. </description>
