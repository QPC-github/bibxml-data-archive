        <title>RFC 6769: Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA), R. Raszuk, J. Heitz, A. Lo, L. Zhang, X. Xu</title>
        <dc:date>2012-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The VA prefixes that are announced within an AS are not announced to any other AS.  The described functionality is of very low operational complexity, as it proposes a confined BGP speaker solution without any dependency on network-wide configuration or requirement for any form of intra-domain tunneling.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
