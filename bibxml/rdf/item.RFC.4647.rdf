        <title>RFC 4647: Matching of Language Tags, A. Phillips, M. Davis</title>
        <dc:date>2006-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a syntax, called a "language-range", for specifying items in a user's list of language preferences.  It also describes different mechanisms for comparing and matching these to language tags.  Two kinds of matching mechanisms, filtering and lookup, are defined.  Filtering produces a (potentially empty) set of language tags, whereas lookup produces a single language tag. Possible applications include language negotiation or content selection.  This document, in combination with RFC 4646, replaces RFC 3066, which replaced RFC 1766.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
