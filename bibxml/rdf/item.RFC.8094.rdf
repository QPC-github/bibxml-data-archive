        <title>RFC 8094: DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), T. Reddy, D. Wing, P. Patil</title>
        <dc:date>2017-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document proposes the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for DNS, to protect against passive listeners and certain active attacks.  As latency is critical for DNS, this proposal also discusses mechanisms to reduce DTLS round trips and reduce the DTLS handshake size.  The proposed mechanism runs over port 853. </description>
