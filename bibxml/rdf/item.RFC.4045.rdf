        <title>RFC 4045: Extensions to Support Efficient Carrying of Multicast Traffic in Layer-2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), G. Bourdon</title>
        <dc:date>2005-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) provides a method for tunneling PPP packets.
