        <title>RFC 3470: Guidelines for the Use of Extensible Markup Language (XML) within IETF Protocols, S. Hollenbeck, M. Rose, L. Masinter</title>
        <dc:date>2003-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring data.  While it evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) -- a markup language primarily focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved to be a widely-used mechanism for representing structured data. There are a wide variety of Internet protocols being developed; many have need for a representation for structured data relevant to their application.  There has been much interest in the use of XML as a representation method.  This document describes basic XML concepts, analyzes various alternatives in the use of XML, and provides guidelines for the use of XML within IETF standards-track protocols.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
