        <title>RFC 5627: Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), J. Rosenberg</title>
        <dc:date>2009-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance.  A URI that routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a registrar and for communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
