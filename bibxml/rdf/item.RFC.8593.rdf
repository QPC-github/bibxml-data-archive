        <title>RFC 8593: Video Traffic Models for RTP Congestion Control Evaluations, X. Zhu, S. Mena, Z. Sarker</title>
        <dc:date>2019-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes two reference video traffic models for evaluating RTP congestion control algorithms.  The first model statistically characterizes the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on the target video rate.  The second model is trace-driven and emulates the output of actual encoded video frame sizes from a high-resolution test sequence.  Both models are designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and authenticity in modeling the interactions between a live video traffic source and the congestion control module.  Finally, the document describes how both approaches can be combined into a hybrid model. </description>
