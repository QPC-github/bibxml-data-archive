        <description>Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individual users or network operations as a whole.  This document provides a description and a summary of generic threats that affect routing protocols in general.  This work describes threats, including threat sources and capabilities, threat actions, and threat consequences, as well as a breakdown of routing functions that might be attacked separately.
