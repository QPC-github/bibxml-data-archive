        <title>RFC 8481: Clarifications to BGP Origin Validation Based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), R. Bush</title>
        <dc:date>2018-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Deployment of BGP origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is hampered by, among other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration. This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those misimplementations; it thus updates RFC 6811 by clarifying that all prefixes should have their validation state set and that policy must not be applied without operator configuration. </description>
