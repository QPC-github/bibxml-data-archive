        <title>RFC 4476: Attribute Certificate (AC) Policies Extension, C. Francis, D. Pinkas</title>
        <dc:date>2006-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes one certificate extension that explicitly states the Attribute Certificate Policies (ACPs) that apply to a given Attribute Certificate (AC).  The goal of this document is to allow relying parties to perform an additional test when validating an AC, i.e., to assess whether a given AC carrying some attributes can be accepted on the basis of references to one or more specific ACPs.
