        <title>RFC 8989: Additional Criteria for Nominating Committee Eligibility, B. Carpenter, S. Farrell</title>
        <dc:date>2021-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that temporarily updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to participate in the IETF Nominating Committee. It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall petition. The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in face-to-face meetings. The experiment is of fixed duration and will apply to one, or at most two, consecutive Nominating Committee cycles, starting in 2021. This document temporarily varies the rules in RFC 8713. </description>
