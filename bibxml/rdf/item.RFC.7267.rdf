        <title>RFC 7267: Dynamic Placement of Multi-Segment Pseudowires, L. Martini, M. Bocci, F. Balus</title>
        <dc:date>2014-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 5254 describes the service provider requirements for extending the reach of pseudowires (PWs) across multiple Packet Switched Network domains.  A multi-segment PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point-to-point PW.  This document describes extensions to the PW control protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi-segment pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers. This document also updates RFC 6073 by updating the value of the Length field of the PW Switching Point PE Sub-TLV Type 0x06 to 14. </description>
