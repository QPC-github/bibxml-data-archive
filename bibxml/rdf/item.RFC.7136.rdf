        <title>RFC 7136: Significance of IPv6 Interface Identifiers, B. Carpenter, S. Jiang</title>
        <dc:date>2014-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses. Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no meaning and that the entire identifier should be treated as an opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies that those two bits are significant only in the process of deriving interface identifiers from an IEEE link-layer address, and it updates RFC 4291 accordingly. </description>
