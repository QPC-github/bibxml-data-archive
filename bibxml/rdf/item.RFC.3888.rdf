        <description>Customers buying enterprise message systems often ask: Can I track the messages?  Message tracking is the ability to find out the path that a particular message has taken through a messaging system and the current routing status of that message.  This document provides a model of message tracking that can be used for understanding the Internet-wide message infrastructure and to further enhance those capabilities to include message tracking, as well as requirements for proposed message tracking solutions.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
