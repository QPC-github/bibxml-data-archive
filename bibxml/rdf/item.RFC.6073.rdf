        <title>RFC 6073: Segmented Pseudowire, L. Martini, C. Metz, T. Nadeau, M. Bocci, M. Aissaoui</title>
        <dc:date>2011-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to connect pseudowires (PWs) between different Packet Switched Network (PSN) domains or between two or more distinct PW control plane domains, where a control plane domain uses a common control plane protocol or instance of that protocol for a given PW.  The different PW control plane domains may belong to independent autonomous systems, or the PSN technology is heterogeneous, or a PW might need to be aggregated at a specific PSN point.  The PW packet data units are simply switched from one PW to another without changing the PW payload.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
