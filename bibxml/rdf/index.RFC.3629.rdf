        <title>RFC 3629: UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646, F. Yergeau</title>
        <dc:date>2003-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.  The originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8, the object of this memo.  UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values.  This memo obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279. </description>
