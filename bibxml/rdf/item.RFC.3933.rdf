        <title>RFC 3933: A Model for IETF Process Experiments, J. Klensin, S. Dawkins</title>
        <dc:date>2004-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> This document specifies a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a "propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational experience" model rather than those previously attempted.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
