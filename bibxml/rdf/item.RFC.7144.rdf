        <title>RFC 7144: Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) SCSI Features Update, F. Knight, M. Chadalapaka</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto TCP/IP.  The iSCSI protocol as specified in RFC 7143 (and as previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC 5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) version of the SCSI family of protocols.  This document defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5. </description>
