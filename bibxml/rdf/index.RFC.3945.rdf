        <title>RFC 3945: Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture, E. Mannie</title>
        <dc:date>2004-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description> This document describes the architecture of GMPLS.  GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).  The focus of GMPLS is on the control plane of these various layers since each of them can use physically diverse data or forwarding planes.  The intention is to cover both the signaling and the routing part of that control plane.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
