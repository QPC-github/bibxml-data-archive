<abstract><t>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport protocol (ROUTE protocol) is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects, including Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport. Application Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers, for example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment, a WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications.</t><t> The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast transport. Therefore, it can be run over UDP/IP including multicast IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security protocols such as IPSec.</t><t> This document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used by a variety of services for delivery of Application Objects by specifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g. by adding or constraining some features).</t><t> This is not an IETF specification and does not have IETF consensus.</t></abstract>
