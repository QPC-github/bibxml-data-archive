<abstract><t>This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol run between two parties for deriving a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.  SPAKE2+ is an augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party has knowledge of the password.  This method is simple to implement, compatible with any prime order group and is computationally efficient.</t><t> This document was produced outside of the IETF and IRTF, and represents the opinions of the authors.  Publication of this document as an RFC in the Independent Submissions Stream does not imply endorsement of SPAKE2+ by the IETF or IRTF.</t></abstract>
