<abstract><t>The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and set of mechanisms to derive, convey and use an attribute allowing the implementation of fine-grain user group-level and application group- level requirements in the network layer.  APN aims to apply various policies in different nodes along a network path onto a traffic flow altogether, for example, at the headend to steer into corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect corresponding performance measurement data, and at the service function to execute particular policies.  Currently there is still no way to efficiently realize this composite network service provisioning along the path.  This document further clarifies the scope of the APN work and describes the solution gap analysis.</t></abstract>
