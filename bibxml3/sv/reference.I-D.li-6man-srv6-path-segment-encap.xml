<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called &quot;segments&quot;. The SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data plane, called SRv6.  In some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM), an SRv6 path needs to be identified.  An SRv6 Path Segment can be used for identifying an SRv6 path.  This document defines a P-flag in the Segment Routing Header to indicate the appearence of SRv6 Path Segment.</t></abstract>
