<abstract><t>This document changes the review requirements needed to get DNSSEC algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries.  It updates RFC 6014 to include hash algorithms for DS (Delegation Signer) records and NSEC3 (Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence) parameters.  It also updates RFC 5155 and RFC 6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms, and updates RFC 8624 to say that algorithms that are described in RFCs that are not on standards track are only at the &quot;MAY&quot; level of implementation recommendation.  The rationale for these changes is to bring the requirements for DS records and for the hash algorithms used in NSEC3 in line with the requirements for all other DNSSEC algorithms.</t></abstract>
