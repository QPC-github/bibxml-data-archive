<abstract><t>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered replication and forwarding for &quot;Bit Index Explicit Replication&quot; (BIER, RFC8279) packets.  It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER.</t><t> BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for &quot;bit positions&quot; (BP).  They indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate &quot;Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers&quot; (BFER).  A BIER-TE packets BitString therefore indicates the edges of the (loop- free) tree that the packet is forwarded across by BIER-TE.  BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes.  Co- existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible, for example by using separate BIER &quot;sub-domains&quot; (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay, and can therefore operate without depending on an &quot;Interior Gateway Routing protocol&quot; (IGP).</t></abstract>
