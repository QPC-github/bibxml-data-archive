<abstract><t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support some applications' needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the resources and characteristics provided by the underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which can be used to support one or a group of VPN+ services.  In the context of network slicing, a VTN could be instantiated as a network resource partition (NRP).</t><t> This document specifies the BGP-LS mechanisms with necessary extensions to advertise the information of scalable Segment Routing (SR) based NRPs to a centralized network controller.  Each NRP can have a customized topology and a set of network resources allocated from the physical network.  Multiple NRPs may shared the same topology, and multiple NRPs may share the same set of network resources on specific network segments.  This allows flexible combination of network topology and network resource attributes to build a large number of NRPs with a relatively small number of logical topologies.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t></abstract>
