<abstract><t>This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by Tunnel Encap[RFC9012] Path Attribute for egress router to advertise the running status and environment for the directly attached 5G Edge Computing (EC) servers. The AppMetaData can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make path selection not only based on the routing distance but also the running environment of the destinations. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G EC services.</t><t> The extension enables an EC server at one specific location to be more preferred than the others with the same IP address to receive data flows from a specific source (UE).</t></abstract>
