<abstract><t>Information about which entities are authorized to perform what operations on which constituents of other entities is a crucial component of producing an overall system that is secure.  Conveying precise authorization information is especially critical in highly automated systems with large numbers of entities, such as the &quot;Internet of Things&quot;.</t><t> This specification provides a generic information model and format for representing such authorization information, as well as two variants of a specific instantiation of that format for use with REST resources identified by URI path.</t></abstract>
