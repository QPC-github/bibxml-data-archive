<abstract><t>QUIC address migration allows clients to change their IP address while maintaining connection state.  To reduce the ability of an observer to link two IP addresses, clients and servers use new connection IDs when they communicate via different client addresses. This poses a problem for traditional &quot;layer-4&quot; load balancers that route packets via the IP address and port 4-tuple.  This specification provides a standardized means of securely encoding routing information in the server's connection IDs so that a properly configured load balancer can route packets with migrated addresses correctly.  As it proposes a structured connection ID format, it also provides a means of connection IDs self-encoding their length to aid some hardware offloads.</t></abstract>
