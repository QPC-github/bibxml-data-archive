<abstract><t>The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to facilitate the high-quality and persistent identification of information objects.  The label &quot;ark:&quot; marks the start of a core ARK identifier that can be made actionable by prepending the beginning of a URL.  Meant to be usable after today's networking technologies become obsolete, that core should be recognizable in the future as a globally unique ARK independent of the URL hostname, HTTP, etc.  A founding principle of ARKs is that persistence is purely a matter of service and neither inherent in an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming syntax.  The best any identifier can do is lead users to services that support robust reference.  A full-functioning ARK leads the user to the identified object and, with the &quot;?info&quot; inflection appended, returns a metadata record and a commitment statement that is both human- and machine-readable.  Tools exist for minting, binding, and resolving ARKs.</t></abstract>
