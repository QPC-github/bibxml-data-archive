    <description>In order to provide high availability for transport networks, link protection technologies are adopted in the data plane. In present Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) optical transport networks, one of these protection technologies, shared ring protection technologies, such as the 2/4- Fiber Bi-directional Multiplex Section Shared Protection Ring(MS- SPRing), are widely used. The same technologies can also be applied in Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document describes a set of issues to be addressed when applying GMPLS) to support MS-SPRings, and sets out how GMPLS can be applied.</description>
