    <title>"A SYSLOG Capability for NETCONF", Philip Shafer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shafer-netconf-syslog-00.txt</link>
    <description>SYSLOG is the most prevalent mechanism for delivering event notification data off networking devices. NETCONF is intended to provide a standard mechanism for performing configuration operations on networking devices. The two areas will overlap, giving rise to a need for receiving notification data over NETCONF. This document presents a simple mechanism for accessing SYSLOG data over NETCONF, implemented using the existing NETCONF RPC infrastructure.</description>
