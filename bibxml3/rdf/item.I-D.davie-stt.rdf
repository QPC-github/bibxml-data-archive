    <title>"A Stateless Transport Tunneling Protocol for Network Virtualization (STT)", Bruce Davie, Jesse Gross</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-davie-stt-08.txt</link>
    <description>Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling protocols.  This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling), a tunnel encapsulation that enables overlay networks to be built in virtualized networks.  STT is particularly useful when some tunnel endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of the network interface card to improve performance.  This draft documents the protocol and the rationale for its design, and highlights issues that may arise in deployments.</description>
