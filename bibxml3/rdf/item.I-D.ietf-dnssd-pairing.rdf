    <title>"Device Pairing Using Short Authentication Strings", Christian Huitema, Daniel Kaiser</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnssd-pairing-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a device pairing mechanism that establishes a relation between two devices by agreeing on a secret and manually verifying the secret's authenticity using an SAS (short authentication string).  Pairing has to be performed only once per pair of devices, as for a re-discovery at any later point in time, the exchanged secret can be used for mutual authentication.  The proposed pairing method is suited for each application area where human operated devices need to establish a relation that allows configurationless and privacy preserving re-discovery at any later point in time.  Since privacy preserving applications are the main suitors, we especially care about privacy.</description>
