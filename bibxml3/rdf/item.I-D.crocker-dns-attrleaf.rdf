    <title>"DNS Scoped Data Through '_Underscore' Attribute Leaves", dcrocker</title>

    <description>Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name.  Recent additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node name, beginning with an underscore.  The underscore construct is used to define a semantic scope for DNS records that are associated with the parent domain.  This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "underscore names" registry with IANA.</description>
