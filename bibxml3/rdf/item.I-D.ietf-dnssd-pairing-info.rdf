    <title>"Device Pairing Design Issues", Daniel Kaiser, Christian Huitema</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnssd-pairing-info-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses issues and problems occuring in the design of device pairing mechanism.  It presents experience with existing pairing systems and general user interaction requirements to make the case for "short authentication strings".  It then reviews the design of cryptographic algorithms designed to maximise the robustness of the short authentication string mechanisms, as well as implementation considerations such as integration with TLS.</description>
