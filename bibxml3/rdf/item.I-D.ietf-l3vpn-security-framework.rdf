    <description>This draft addresses security aspects pertaining to Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). We first describe the security threats that are relevant in the context of PPVPNs, and the defensive techniques that can be used to combat those threats. We consider security issues deriving both from malicious behavior of anyone and from negligent or incorrect behavior of the providers. We also describe how these security attacks should be detected and reported. We then discuss the possible user requirements in terms of security in a PPVPN service. These user requirements translate into corresponding requirements for the providers. In addition, the provider may have additional requirements to make its network infrastructure secure to a level that can meet the PPVPN customer's expectations. Finally, we define a template that may be used to analyze the security characteristics of a specific PPVPN technology and describe them in a manner consistent with this framework.</description>
