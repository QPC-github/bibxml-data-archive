    <description>RFC 2181 collected eight independent considerations and created a single docuement to address each of them in turn.  Over the following two decades it has become clear that each of these items should be considered and evovolve in its own right, as suggested in RFC 2181. This document extracts the exact text from RFC 2181 and places it into its own track.</description>
