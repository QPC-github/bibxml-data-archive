    <title>"A mini-FRR(Fast Rerouting) mechanism for IP/MPLS network", Shaoling Sun</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-defeng-mpls-mini-fast-rerouting-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document analyzes the weakness of current fast rerouting mechanisms in IP network[1] and MPLS enabled network [2]describes a simple fast rerouting mechanism for IP/MPLS network, and with these points in mind, proposes the simple fast reroute mechanisms based on the intrinsic characteristics of IP network and MPLS network, and illustrates the principles of these mechanisms in node protection and link/path protection.</description>
