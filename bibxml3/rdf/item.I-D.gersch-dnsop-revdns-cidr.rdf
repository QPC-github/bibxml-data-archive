    <title>"Reverse DNS Naming Convention for CIDR Address Blocks", Joe Gersch, Dan Massey, Eric Osterweil, Cathie Olschanowsky</title>

    <description>This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address blocks into the reverse DNS namespace.  The reverse DNS naming method is commonly used to specify a complete IP address.  This document describes how to encode an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address block such as 129.82.128.0/17.  By defining a common naming convention, one can associate information with a prefix.  The convention builds on past work in RFC 1101 that associates network names with prefixes. However, this previous work pre-dated the introduction of CIDR and has several critical ambiguities.  This convention corrects the ambiguities and enables new applications ranging from routing information to geolocation.</description>
