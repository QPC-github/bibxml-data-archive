    <title>"An Efficient Loop Detection Algorithm for SIP Proxies", Byron Campen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-campen-sipping-stack-loop-detect-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a loop-detection algorithm with a cumulative O(n) complexity (O(1) average complexity for each proxy) and average O(log n) state-space, where n is the number of proxies that the message passes through. Also, the backwards-compatibility and security of this algorithm are discussed. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working group list at 'sipping@ietf.org'.</description>
