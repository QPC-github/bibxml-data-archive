    <title>"RRCP A Receiver-Driven and Router-Feedback Congestion Control Protocol for ICN", Mingwei Xu, Chunmei Xia</title>

    <description>Network requirements have evolved from data communications between two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The current Internet employs an address-centric network communication model, which is efficient for communications between hosts, but not efficient for communications between a host and a network. Given this fact, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has become a hot spot to meet the new requirement.  In ICN there exists a congestion problem which hasn't been well solved. We provide a new congestion control protocol, RRCP, since the congestion control protocols in IP networks are not suitable for ICN transport.  RRCP, with XCP and ICN transport characteristics, advances a receiver-driven and router- feedback mechanism.  RRCP can stay efficient, fair and stable via the validation of simulation.</description>
