    <description>This document shares knowledge and insights regarding applying machine learning techniques on wireless sensor networks.  It firstly introduces advantages and difficulties in adopting machine learning techniques on wireless sensor networks.  Though dynamicity and unpredictability of wireless networks make it difficult to train the model with various possible scenarios, it has strong ability in terms of flexibility.  This document also overviews several works that applied machine learning techniques on diverse research areas including networking, communications and lossy environment.  The ultimate purpose of this document is to discuss a proper research direction aiming the realization of a system that detects, predicts and recovers from abnormal situations on wireless sensor networks.</description>
