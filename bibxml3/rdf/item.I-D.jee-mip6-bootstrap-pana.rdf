    <title>"Diameter Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping Application using PANA", Junghoon Jee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jee-mip6-bootstrap-pana-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support the Mobile IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication and authorization phase based on PANA. PANA is used as a protocol for network authentication between mobile nodes and access networks. During the PANA authentication phase, the mobile node's initial configuration information like its home address, home agent address and IKEv2/IKEv1 pre-shared keying material is piggybacked to the PANA messages cryptographically protected by the PANA SA. The Diameter and PANA message formats to support the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in the integrated bootstrapping scenario are defined.</description>
