    <description>This document defines the requirements for an autonomic control loop, describes different types of control loops, and explains how control loops are used in an Autonomic System. Control loops are used to enable Autonomic Network Management systems to adapt the behavior of the systems that they manage to respond to changes in user needs, business goals, and/or environmental conditions.</description>
