    <description>On-path network performance measurements methods currently deployed contribute to the ossification of the Internet because they are expensive to deploy and to maintain. This draft motivates the exposure of QUIC header fields for on-path network measurements and their specification in the QUIC core protocol as a solution to avoid on-path network performance measurements to ossify the IP stack in the future.</description>
