    <description>A Path Computation Element can compute traffic engineering paths (TE paths) through a network that are subject to various constraints. Currently, TE paths are label switched paths (LSPs) which are set up using the RSVP-TE signaling protocol.  However, other TE path setup methods are possible within the PCE architecture.  This document proposes an extension to PCEP to allow support for different path setup methods over a given PCEP session.</description>
