    <title>"Location and Discovery of Subsets of Resources", Lican Huang</title>

    <description>This file is a proposal for location and discovery of filter resources selected by search-conditions. The peers,which are virtually grouped, construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical tree overlay network. With cached addresses of peers, the overload of traffic in tree structure can be avoided. The resources are classified into hierarchical domains, and registered into the peers which are located in the same domain virtual groups as the resources'.  This proposal supports flexible queries by a SQL-like query statement.</description>
