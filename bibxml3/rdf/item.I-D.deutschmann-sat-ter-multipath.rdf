        <description>Multipath communication enables the combination of low data rate, low latency terrestrial links and high data rate, high latency links (e.g., geostationary satellite links) to provide a full-fledged Internet access.  However, the combination of such heterogeneous links is challenging from a technical point of view.  This document describes a possible solution, i.e. an architecture and scheduling mechanism.  The applicability of this approach to encrypted transport protocols (e.g., Multipath QUIC) is also discussed.</description>
