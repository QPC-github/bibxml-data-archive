    <description>[RFC8280] has identified and documented important principles, such as Data Minimization, End-to-End, and Interoperability in order to enable access to fundamental Human Rights.  While (partial) implementations of these concepts are already available, many current applications lack Privacy support that the average user can easily navigate.  This document covers analysis of threats to privacy and security and derives requirements from this threat analysis.</description>
