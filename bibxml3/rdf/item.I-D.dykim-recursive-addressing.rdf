    <description>This document describes network architecture based on recursive addressing.  The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a site address drawn from a global number space while each node is named by a node address drawn from a number space local to each site. Routing among sites depends solely on site addresses while that within each site on node addresses.  Flat routing to render inherent mobility as well as mapped routing to additionally cope with table size are proposed.  The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well as body area networks.</description>
