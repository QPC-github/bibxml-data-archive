    <description>This document describes an architectural work that competes with the IP Fast Re-Route (IPFRR) solution which aims to minimize the network down time in the event of equipments failure.  The work provides a layered framework based upon which applications such as the domain- wide fast convergence may be achieved through the transport layer fast delivery of failure notifications.</description>
