    <description>Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability. The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi- layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies.  Expires November 2008  [page 1]  draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-reqs-11.txt  May 2008  In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is referred to in this document as a Multi-Region Network (MRN). When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either a single or multiple regions, this document uses the term, Multi-Layer Network (MLN). This document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements.</description>
