    <title>"Current Hostname Practice Considered Harmful", Christian Huitema, Dave Thaler</title>

    <description>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from network to hot spot is the Internet equivalent of walking around with a name tag affixed to your lapel.  The practice can significantly compromise your privacy, and should stop.  There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all.  This document studies another possible remedy, which is to replace the static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.  This idea obviously needs more work.</description>
