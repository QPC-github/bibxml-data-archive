        <description>Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) is deprecated.  Accordingly, IKEv1 has been moved to Historic status.  A number of old algorithms that are associated with IKEv1, and not widely implemented for IKEv2 are deprecated as well.  IANA is instructed to close all IKEv1 registries.</description>
