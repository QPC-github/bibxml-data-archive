    <description>The problems of modern datacenters are rooted in virtualized host scaling. Virtualization implies VM mobility, which may be intra- datacenter or inter-datacenter. Mobility may cross administrative boundaries, such as across private-public domains. A public datacenter may be multi-tenant, extending several private networks into the public domain. Running these massively scaled, virtualized, multi-tenant datacenters poses some unique networking and operational challenges. This document describes these challenges.</description>
