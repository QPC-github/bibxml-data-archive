    <description>This document describes a passive method to perform packet loss, delay and jitter measurements on live traffic.  This method is based on Alternate Marking (Coloring) technique.  A report on the operational experiment done at Telecom Italia is explained in order to give an example and show the method applicability.  This technique can be applied in various situations as detailed in this document. The previous IETF drafts about this technique were: [I-D.cociglio-mboned-multicast-pm] and [I-D.tempia-opsawg-p3m].</description>
