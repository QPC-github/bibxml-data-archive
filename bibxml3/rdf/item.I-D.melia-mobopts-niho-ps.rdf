    <description>This is a first document describing the rational about network support for decision making and execution of handovers. Starting from existing technologies and considering new trends from mobile operators, we draw potential deployment scenarios and derive a set of associated functionalities. These functionalities and associated assumptions are listed in the document. Application areas for network initiated handovers are then illustrated specifying a set of goals and non-goals to be addressed in a future version.</description>
