    <title>"Discovery of CoAP servers across subnets", Anders Brandt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-brandt-coap-subnet-discovery-00.txt</link>
    <description>The document describes the process of discovering CoAP servers distributed in multiple subnets in a non-specified topology.  CoAP Discovery Gateways are used to discover one subnet from another. CoAP Discovery Gateways may provide caching to enable discovery of sleeping nodes in LLN environments.  The solution scales to large installations since discovery is handled by the client in an incremental fashion.</description>
