    <title>"Live Media and Metadata Ingest Protocol", Rufail Mekuria, Sam Zhang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mekuria-mmediaingest-01.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet draft presents a best industry practice for ingesting encoded live media to media processing entities. Two profiles of the media ingest are defined covering the most common use cases. The first profile facilates active media processing and is based on the fragmented MPEG-4 format. The second profile enables efficient ingest of media streaming presentations based on established streaming protocols by also adding a manifest besides the fragmented MPEG-4 stream. Details on carriage of metadata markers, timed text, subtitles and encryption specific metadata are also included.</description>
