    <title>"A TCP Authentication Option Extension for Payload Encryption", Joseph Touch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-touch-tcp-ao-encrypt-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension to the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) to encrypt the TCP segment payload in addition to providing TCP-AO's authentication of the payload, TCP header, and IP pseudoheader. This extension augments how the packet contents and headers are processed and which keys are derived, and adds a capability for in-band coordination of unauthenticated Diffie- Hellman key exchange at connection establishment. The extension preserves key rollover coordination and protection of long-lived connections.</description>
