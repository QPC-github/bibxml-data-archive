    <title>"Subscription/Notification for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)", Peng Xun, Spencer Dawkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dawkins-ldapext-subnot-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to support subscription and notification mechanism.  An LDAP client can subscribe to data of interest available from an LDAP server and receive notifications from the LDAP server when this data is updated. By this means, an LDAP client can become aware of changes to data of interest in a timely manner.</description>
