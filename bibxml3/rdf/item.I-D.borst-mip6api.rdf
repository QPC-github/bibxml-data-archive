    <description>By design, Mobile IPv6 does not provide movement information to higher layers or applications. However, new breeds of location-sensitive applications and technologies would benefit from having access to such information. This document outlines how the knowledge of mobility can be usefully harnessed by applications which reside in a mobile node as well as a correspondent node. It then defines an application-level API to fulfill those needs.</description>
