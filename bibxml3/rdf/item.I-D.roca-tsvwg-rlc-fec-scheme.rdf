    <title>"The Sliding Window Random Linear Code (RLC) Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) Scheme for FECFRAME", Vincent Roca</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roca-tsvwg-rlc-fec-scheme-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a fully-specified FEC scheme for the Sliding Window Random Linear Codes (RLC) over GF(2^^m), where m equals 1 (binary case), 4 or 8, that can be used to protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by FECFRAME extended to sliding window codes.  These sliding window FEC codes rely on an encoding window that slides over the source symbols, generating new repair symbols whenever needed.  Compared to block FEC codes, these sliding window FEC codes offer key advantages with real-time flows in terms of reduced FEC-related latency while often providing improved erasure recovery capabilities.</description>
