    <title>"PIM neighbor reduction for transit LAN's.", IJsbrand Wijnands, Yiqun Cai</title>

    <description>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly connected to it on startup.  Networks that are LANs or behave like a LAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how many routers are attached to it.  If such a LAN is also a transit network (no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIM procedures don't apply.  This proposal describes a procedure to reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.</description>
