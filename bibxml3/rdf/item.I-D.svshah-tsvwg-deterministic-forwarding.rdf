    <description>This document defines a Differentiated Services Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) Group called Deterministic Forwarding (DF).  The document describes the purpose and semantics of this PHB.  It also describes creation and forwarding treatment of the service class.  The document also describes how the code-point can be mapped into one of the aggregated Diffserv service classes [RFC5127].</description>
