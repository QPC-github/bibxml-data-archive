    <description>This document describes the scenarios, simulation and suggestions for the "Centrally Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR)" architecture, which integrates the merit of traditional distributed protocols (IGP/BGP), and the power of centrally control technologies (PCE/SDN) to provide one feasible traffic engineering solution in various complex scenarios for the service provider.  Traditional MPLS-TE solution is mainly used in static network planning scenario and is difficult to meet the QoS assurance requirements in real-time traffic network. With the emerge of SDN concept and related technologies, it is possible to simplify the complexity of distributed control protocol, utilize the global view of network condition, give more efficient solution for traffic engineering in various complex scenarios.</description>
