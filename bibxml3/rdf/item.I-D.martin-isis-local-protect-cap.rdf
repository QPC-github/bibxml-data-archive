    <title>"ISIS Extensions to support U-turn Alternates for IP/LDP Fast-Reroute", Alia  Atlas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-isis-local-protect-cap-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies additional information that can inserted in IS-IS LSPs to convey link capabilities that may be useful in certain applications. In particular, an IS may convey that zero or more of its links are explicit marked and/or implicit U-turn recipient capable, which may be described as capable of identifying traffic as U-turn traffic and redirecting the traffic to a suitable alternate. The immediate applicability for these two link capabilities is in support of local protection, provided by a U-turn alternate, in the event of a link and/or node failure while the IS-IS area is reconverging onto a new topology.</description>
