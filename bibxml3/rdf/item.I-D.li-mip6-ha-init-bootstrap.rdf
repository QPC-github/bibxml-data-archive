    <description>This document defined a Home Agent initiated Bootstrap solution as a complementarity to current Bootstrap solutions. In home agent reliability problem, current bootstrap solution is not appropriate because sometimes mobile node would be infeasible to initiate the bootstrap procedure. However, a Home Agent initiated bootstrap solution would be suitable in this case.</description>
