    <title>"Federated Multi-Tenant Service Architecture for an Internet of Things", (Unknown), Herb Wildfeuer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-burgess-promise-iot-arch-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes architectural recommendations for a unified concept of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, based on tried and tested principles from infrastructure science.  We describe a functional service architecture that may be applied in the manner of a platform, from the smallest scale to the largest scale, using vendor agnostic principles.  The current draft is rooted in the principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary cooperation.</description>
