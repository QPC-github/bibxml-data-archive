    <title>"Method to specify optimal specificaiton of service ports for flow bindings", Robert Jaksa</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jaksa-monami6-flowserv-01.txt</link>
    <description>This method introduces a specification in the Mobile IPv6 MONAMI6 work that allow nodes to bind a particular flow based on the service port to a care-of address. This method is different and more flexible than a current solution in the Internet community in that multiple ranges of ports and individual specific ports not in any defined range may be specified within a single flow identification message. This is an idea that may be adopted or incorporated into currently proposed MONAMI6 flow redirection proposals.</description>
