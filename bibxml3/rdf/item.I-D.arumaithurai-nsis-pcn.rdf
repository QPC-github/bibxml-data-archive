    <title>"NSIS PCN-QoSM: A Quality of Service Model for Pre-Congestion Notification  (PCN)", Mayutan Arumaithurai</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-arumaithurai-nsis-pcn-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM), for networks that support the use of the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.  Ths is a technique to perform admission control in a Diffserv network by measuring the congestion level in a domain.  New flows are admitted only if the current congestion level is below the allowed threshold.  When the controlled load in a domain exceeds a certain threshold, the egress prompts the ingress to pre-empt certain flows.  This proposal is based on the proposal made by B.Briscoe et al., for the extension of RSVP to support the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.</description>
