    <title>"Security Mechanism Agreement for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Jari Arkko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niemi-rfc3329bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines new functionality for negotiating the security mechanisms used between a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent and its next-hop SIP entity. This new functionality supplements the existing methods of choosing security mechanisms between SIP entities. Note that this internet-draft is simply a clean RFC 3329 in I-D format, and doesn't yet contain any changes compared to the original.</description>
