    <title>"End-to-end Extension for PCN Encoding", Michael Menth, Jozef Babiarz, T  Moncaster</title>

    <description>This document proposes an encoding of PCN marks based on the ECN field of the Voice-Admit DSCP.  It has global meaning and ECN semantics are not applied to that field.  The PCN codepoints are the same as those for packet-specific dual marking (PSDM) within a single PCN domain, but the general concept can also be applied to other encodings requiring only a single PCN-enabled DSCP.</description>
