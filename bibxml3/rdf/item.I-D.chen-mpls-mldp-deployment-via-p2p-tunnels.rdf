    <title>"Deploying mLDP Through P2P LSP Tunnels", Emily Chen, Quintin Zhao</title>

    <description>The existing specification for Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) functionality assumes that a pair of LDP speakers which support the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected, or they can reach each other through targeted LDP session and transparent tunnel(s).  However, the real deployment may not satisfy these assumptions, especially in the case where the targeted LDP session and the transparent tunnel(s) have to be pre-established.  This document provides an automatic solution for finding the nearest upstream node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from the current node to the root node, and triggering the targeted LDP session and transparent tunnel(s) when needed.</description>
