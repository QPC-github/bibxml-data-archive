    <description>This document specifies the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol--Tracker Protocol (PPSP-TP), an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such as initial offer/request of participation in multimedia content streaming, content information, peer lists and reports of activity and status.  The specification outlines the architecture of the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows, message processing instructions, message formats, formal syntax and semantics.  The PPSP Tracker Protocol enables cooperating peers to form content streaming overlay networks to support near real-time Structured Media content (audio, video, associated text/metadata) delivery, such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable) and multi- view (3D), in live, time-shifted and on-demand modes.</description>
