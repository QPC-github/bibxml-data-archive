    <description>The Domain Name System (DNS) makes use of a hierarchical naming scheme.  The validity of a particular name in the DNS is governed by protocol, operational and policy considerations.  The IETF has identified particular domain names to have special considerations associated with their use.  These domain names have been identified in various documents in the RFC series.  This document describes the creation of an IANA registry to catalogue such domain names and provides direction about how this registry should be maintained.  This document does not identify any new domain name as having special considerations associated with its use.</description>
