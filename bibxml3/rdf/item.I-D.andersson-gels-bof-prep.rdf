    <title>"Use of the Gnerealized Multi-Protocol Label Switching control plane for  point-to-point Ethernet Label Switching", Loa Andersson, Dimitri Papadimitriou</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-andersson-gels-bof-prep-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes starting a work within the IETF to apply the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane to Ethernet Label Switching and to make extensions to the GMPLS control plane protocols as necessary for this application. This will be done based on the protocols developed by the MPLS and CCAMP working groups in the IETF. Ethernet Label Switching will use the data plane encodings as specified by the IEEE 802 standards. This document intends to gather the information necessary to have a "GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching" BoF in Vancouver.</description>
