    <description>This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low- power and lossy networks.  The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated Address using an Elliptic Curve Cryptography public key, register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default router and periodically refresh the registration.  Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks.  Cryptographically generated address and digital signature are calculated using elliptic curve cryptography public key of the node.</description>
