    <description>This document presents the basic network objectives for the behavior of shared mesh protection (SMP) not based on control-plane support. This is an expansion of the basic requirements presented in the MPLS Transport Profile Requirements (RFC5654) and MPLS Transport Profile Survivability Framework (RFC6372) documents.  This document should be used as a basis for the definition of the mechanism that would be used to implement SMP for MPLS-TP data paths, in networks that do not employ a control plane for their operation.</description>
