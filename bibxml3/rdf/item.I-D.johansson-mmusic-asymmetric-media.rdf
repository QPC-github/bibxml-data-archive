    <title>"Setup of Asymmetric Media with SDP", Ingemar Johansson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-johansson-mmusic-asymmetric-media-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes an extension to the SDP Capability Negotiation framework for the setup of asymmetric sessions.  One example of an asymmetric session is a conversational video session between a handset with a small screen (high-resolution camera) and a home- entertainment set-top box connected to a wide-screen TV.  Another example is tightly coupled conferences with different number of in and outgoing streams for each client.</description>
