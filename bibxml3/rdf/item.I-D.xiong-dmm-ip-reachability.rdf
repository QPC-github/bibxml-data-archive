    <description>In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address to communicate with different hosts.  When a new correspondent node (CN) initials an IP session with MN, the CN needs to find and select one of the MN's IP addresses to provide best performance (e.g. with low delay) for the IP session.  This draft analyses the existing mechanisms for IP reachability in a distributed mobility management environment, and identifies the key procedures or enhancements to support the routing-optimized IP reachability in a distributed mobility management environment.</description>
