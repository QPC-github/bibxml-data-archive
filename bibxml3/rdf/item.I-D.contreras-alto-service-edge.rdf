        <description>Service providers are starting to deploy and interconnect computing capabilities across the network for hosting network functions and applications.  In distributed computing environments, both computing and topological information are necessary in order to determine the more convenient infrastructure where to deploy such a service or application.  This document proposes an initial approach towards the use of ALTO to provide such information and assist the selection of appropriate deployment locations for services and applications.</description>
