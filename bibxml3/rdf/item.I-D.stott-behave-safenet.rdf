    <title>"SAFENeT: Server-based Architecture For Enterprise NAT and Firewall  Transversal", Richard Townsend</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stott-behave-safenet-00.txt</link>
    <description>One of the main challenges hindering the acceptance of VoIP is a standards-based solution for traversing middleboxes such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and FireWall (FW) boxes. This Internet- Draft presents SAFENeT, a protocol that is intended to operate in an enterprise environment and that allows the accommodation of real-time services by the call server, internal to the enterprise network, to communicate with the NAT/FW to enable the transversal of real-time services including VoIP. This document describes the SAFENeT architecture and protocol and shows how it overcomes the problems caused by NATs/FWs. The SAFENeT architecture also enables security features such as data confidentiality and digital integrity to be used for the VoIP traffic traversing the NAT/FW.</description>
