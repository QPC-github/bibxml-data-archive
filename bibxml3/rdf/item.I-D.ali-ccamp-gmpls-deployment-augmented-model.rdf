    <description>One of the biggest challenges faced by GMPLS technology is “how it can be deployed” in a manner least impacting to existing IP/ MPLS networks. GMPLS architecture document lists [RFC3945] three different scenarios in which GMPLS technology can be deployed: overlay, augmented and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem of migration from MPLS to GMPLS networks using the integrated model. This draft addresses the same problem space for augmented model and illustrates the applicability of augmented model in deploying GMPLS technology in existing IP/ MPLS networks.</description>
