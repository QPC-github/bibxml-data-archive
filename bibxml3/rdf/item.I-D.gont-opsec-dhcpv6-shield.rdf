    <title>"DHCPv6-Shield: Protecting Against Rogue DHCPv6 Servers", Fernando Gont, Will Liu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gont-opsec-dhcpv6-shield-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected to a broadcast network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  The aforementioned mechanism is based on DHCPv6 packet-filtering at the layer-2 device on which the packets are received.  The aforementioned mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'), and hence it is desirable that similar functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.</description>
