    <title>"MPLS Benchmarking Methodology", Aamer Akhter, Rajiv Asati</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-akhter-bmwg-mpls-meth-04.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to the benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this benchmarking will be limited to various types of packet-forwarding and delay measurements. It builds upon the tenets set forth in  RFC2544 [RFC2544], RFC1242 [RFC1242] and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts.  This document seeks to extend these efforts to the MPLS paradigm.</description>
