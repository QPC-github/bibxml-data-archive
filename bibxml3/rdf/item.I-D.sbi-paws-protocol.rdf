    <title>"Protocol for Communication between White Space Device and White Space Database", Donald Joslyn, Robin Roberts</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sbi-paws-protocol-00.pdf</link>
    <description>This document defines an application protocol for WSDB services provided to TV Band Devices (TVBDs). The protocol complies with FCC Rules/Requirements [FCC 10-174] and in the context of operating an FCC certified database, it also complies with requirements defined by IETF PAWS [IETF-PAWS-03]. We believe this protocol can be easily extended to include the remaining requirements not already satisfied from the IETF PAWS requirements.</description>
