        <description>With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchains and decentralized ledger technology (DLT) networksorks for virtual asset management, there is a need for these networks to have interoperability to support applications and services built atop these networks.  An interoperability architecture for DLT networks is therefore needed in order to permit the secure flow of digital assets different DLT networks, satisfying the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency and durability.  The architecture must recognize that there are different DLT networks and that the interior constructs in these networks maybe incompatible with one another. This document proposes an interoperability architecture based on DLT Gateways, which are points of interconnection between networks. Among others, the gateways implement one or more protocols for the transfer (or exchange) digital assets between DLT networks.  A gateway belonging to a DLT network peers with another gateway belonging to a different DLT network to perform the asset transfer between the two networks.</description>
