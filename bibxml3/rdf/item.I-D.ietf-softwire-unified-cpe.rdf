    <title>"Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire CPE: A DHCPv6-based Prioritization Mechanism", Mohamed Boucadair, Ian Farrer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-softwire-unified-cpe-08.txt</link>
    <description>In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4 service continuity.  A number of differing functional approaches have been developed for this, each having their own specific characteristics.  As these approaches share a similar functional architecture and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo specifies a DHCPv6 option whereby a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services by providing a prioritization mechanism.</description>
