    <title>"QUIC: A UDP-Based Secure and Reliable Transport for HTTP/2", Ryan Hamilton, Janardhan Iyengar, Ian Swett, Alyssa Wilk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tsvwg-quic-protocol-02.txt</link>
    <description>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for HTTP/2 semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application protocol, QUIC builds on decades of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive as a modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC provides multiplexing and flow control equivalent to HTTP/2, security equivalent to TLS, and connection semantics, reliability, and congestion control equivalent to TCP.</description>
