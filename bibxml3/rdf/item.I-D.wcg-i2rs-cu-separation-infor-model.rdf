    <description>To improve network resource utilization and reduce the operation expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation conception is raised [I-D.gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture].  This document describes the information model for the interface between Control- Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.  This information model may involve both control channel interface and configuration channel interface.  The interface for control channel allows the Control- Plane to send several flow tables to the User-Plane, such as user's information table, user's interface table, and user's QoS table, etc. And it also allows the User-Plane to report the resources and statistics information to the Control-Plane.  The interface for configuration channel is in charge of the version negotiation of protocols between the Control-Plane and User-Plane, the configuration for devices of Control-Plane and User-Plane, and the reports of User- Plane's capabilities, etc.  The information model defined in this document enables defining a standardized data model.  Such a data model can be used to define an interface to the CU separation BNG.</description>
