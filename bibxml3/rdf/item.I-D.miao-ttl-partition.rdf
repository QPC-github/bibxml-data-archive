    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-miao-ttl-partition-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes a TTL-number space ''partition'' mechanism to shield the access control/management plane of a service provider's (SP) core network from customer traffic. Provider edge routers limit the TTL to a preset maximum value on_user_data packet that enters core network, and the core network router drops packet with a TTL as small as or smaller than preset value when the packet destination address is the router itself. Since attack packets from a customer site cannot reach the control plane or application of routers in the SP core network, the control plane of the core network is secured against the class of attacks originating outside the core network.</description>
