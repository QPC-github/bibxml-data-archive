    <title>"FPANA: combining PANA and FMIPv6 for fast authentication at handover", Yoshihiko Kainuma</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hiko-pana-fpana-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a fast authentication protocol called FPANA. A combination of PANA (for node authentication) and FMIP (for fast handover), it offers fast node authentication upon intra-domain handover of a mobile node. Since FPANA makes use of context transfer of the PANA session from the previous access router to the new access router by the HI message of FMIPv6, the PANA session can be set between the mobile node and the new access router prior to the mobile node moving to the new access router. Thus, the mobile node can continue authenticated communication upon intra-domain fast handover.</description>
