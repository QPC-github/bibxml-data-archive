    <description>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation about the Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol.  It explains the motivation for including a ConEx marking at the IP layer: to expose information about congestion to network nodes.  Although such information may have a number of uses, this document focuses on how the information communicated by the ConEx marking can serve as the basis for significantly more efficient and effective traffic management than what exists on the Internet today.</description>
