    <title>"Deprecating Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers", Ole Troan, Brian Carpenter</title>

    <description>Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4)" IPv6 transition mechanism defined in RFC 3056 has shown that when used in its anycast mode, the mechanism is unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the Internet.  This document therefore requests that RFC 3068, "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers", be made obsolete and moved to historic status.  It also obsoletes RFC 6732 "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels".  It recommends that future products should not support 6to4 anycast and that existing deployments should be reviewed.  This complements the guidelines in RFC 6343.</description>
