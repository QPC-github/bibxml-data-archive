    <description>DNS queries sometimes experience problems with end to end connectivity at times and places where HTTPS flows freely.  HTTPS provides the most practical mechanism for reliable end to end communication.  Its use of TLS provides integrity and confidentiality guarantees and its use of HTTP allows it to interoperate with proxies, firewalls, and authentication systems where required for transit.  This document describes how to run DNS service over HTTP using https:// URIs.
