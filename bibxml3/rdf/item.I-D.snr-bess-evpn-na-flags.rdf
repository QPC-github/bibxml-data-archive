    <description>The MAC/IP Advertisement route specified in [RFC7432] can optionally carry IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure. However, if the Neighbor information is learnt via EVPN, the PE would not know if a particular IPv6->MAC pair belongs to a host, a router or a host with an anycast address as this information is not carried in the MAC/IP route advertisements. This document proposes an OPTIONAL advertisement of the Flags defined in [RFC4861] along with the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes, so that an EVPN PE implementing a proxy-ND function can reply to Neighbor Solicitations with the correct Flag information in Neighbor Advertisements.</description>
