    <title>"CoAP Minimum Request Interval", Bert Greevenbosch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-greevenbosch-core-minimum-request-interval-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an "Minimum-Request-Interval" option for CoAP, which can be used to negotiate the minimum time between two subsequent requests within a single client and server pair.  It can be used for flow and congestion control, reducing the consumption of server and network resources when needed.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</description>
