    <title>"Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)", Dino Farinacci, Vince Fuller, David Meyer, Darrel Lewis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-lisp-24.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes a network layer based protocol that enables separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure.  LISP can be incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers traffic engineering, multi-homing, and mobility benefits to early adopters, even when there are relatively few LISP-capable sites.  Design and development of LISP was largely motivated by the problem statement produced by the October 2006 IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop.</description>
