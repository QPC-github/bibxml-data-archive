    <title>"ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF Protocols", Yoav Nir, Adam Langley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nir-cfrg-rfc7539bis-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm.  RFC 7539, the predecessor of this document, was meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide.  It was a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).  This document merges the errata filed against RFC 7539 and adds a little text to the Security Considerations section.</description>
