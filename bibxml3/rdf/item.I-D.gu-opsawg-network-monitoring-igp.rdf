        <description>To evolve towards automated network OAM (Operations, administration and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a fundamental necessity.  This document proposes network monitoring for IGP to facilitate troubleshooting by collecting the IGP monitoring data and reporting it to the network monitoring server in real-time. In this document, the operations of network monitoring for ISIS are described, and the corresponding network monitoring message types and message formats are defined.</description>
