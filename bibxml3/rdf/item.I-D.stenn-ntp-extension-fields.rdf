    <title>"Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) Extension Fields", Harlan Stenn, David Mills</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stenn-ntp-extension-fields-09.txt</link>
    <description>Network Time Protocol version 4 (NTPv4) defines the optional usage of extension fields.  An extension field, as defined in RFC 5905 [RFC5905] and RFC 5906 [RFC5906], resides after the end of the NTP header and supplies optional capabilities or information that cannot be conveyed in the basic NTP packet.  This document updates RFC 5905 [RFC5905] by clarifying some points regarding NTP extension fields and their usage with legacy Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and removes wasteful requirements added by RCF 7822 [RFC7822].  This proposal deprecates RFC 7822 [RFC7822].
