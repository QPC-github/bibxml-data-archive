    <description>SCHC compression mechanism for LPWAN network enables IPv6 on devices connected to a constrained network (LPWAN).  They can communicate with a CoAP server located anywhere in the Internet.  LPWAN network characteristics limits the number of exchanges and may impose a long RTT.  The CoAP server must be aware of these properties to manage correctly requests.  The Time Scale option allows a device to inform a CoAP server of the duration the message ID value should be kept in memory to manage correctly message duplication.</description>
