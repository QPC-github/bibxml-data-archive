    <description>The Kerberos protocol is today one of the most widely deployed authentication protocols in the Internet. In order for a Kerberos deployment to operate in a scalable manner, different Kerberos realms must interoperate in such a way that cross-realm operations can be performed efficiently and securely.  This document provides background information regarding large scale Kerberos deployments in the industrial sector, with the aim of identifying issues in the current Kerberos cross-realm authentication model as defined in RFC4120.  As industrial automation is moving towards wider adoption of Internet standards, the Kerberos authentication protocol represents one of the best alternatives for ensuring the confidentiality and the integrity of communications in control networks while meeting performance and security requirements.  However, the use of Kerberos cross-realm operations in large scale industrial systems may introduce issues that could cause performance and reliability problems. This document describes some examples of actual large scale industrial systems, and lists requirements and restriction regarding authentication operations in such environments.  The current document also identifies a number of requirements derived from the industrial automation field. Although they are found in the field of industrial automation, these requirements are general enough and are applicable to the problem of Kerberos cross-realm operations.  Conventions used in this document  The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms and concepts described in the Kerberos Version 5 [RFC4120].</description>
