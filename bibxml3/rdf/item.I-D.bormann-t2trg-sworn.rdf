        <description>Normally off devices (RFC7228) would need to expend considerable energy resources to be reachable at all times.  Instead, MAC layer mechanisms are often employed that allow the last hop router of the device to "wake" the device via radio when needed.  Activating these devices even for a short time still does expend energy and thus should be available to authorized correspondents only. Traditionally, this has been achieved by heavy firewalling, allowing only authorized hosts to reach the device at all.  This may be too inflexible for an Internet of Things.  The present report describes how to use a combination of currently standardized technologies to securely effect this authorization.  We also discuss how the general approach of the original SWORN protocol can be extended to cover additional use cases and implementation environments.</description>
