    <title>"RRG constraints due to the need for widespread voluntary adoption", Robin Whittle</title>

    <description>This ID will contain a version of my attempt to list the constraints the RRG faces in choosing a scalable routing solution due to the need for widespread voluntary adoption.  This ID is to support and document the IRTF Routing Research Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010.  It is not a formal product of the RRG.  To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.</description>
