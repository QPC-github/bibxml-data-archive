    <description>The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented by allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. To deliver email which uses UTF-8 in email headers through EAI non- compliant environment converting (i.e downgrading) or encapsulation mechanism is required. Some UTF-8 email may sign email headers or email header fields. This document describes mechanism for encapsulation when converting can not be used because of signed email headers. Encapsulation may also be used to forward EAI email through EAI non-compliant environment that way that original EAI email can be recovered.</description>
