    <description>Definition and operation of variant domain names are differ from zone administrators, and there is no generic rules, therefore, in general, it is hard to guess variant labels for end users and / or applications.  Meanwhile, zone administrators are understanding all variant labels list because they generate variant labels and activate them according to rules they defined.  Thus, if there is a mechanism that end users and / or applications can obtain variant labels list from zone administrators, then it would be useful.  The Variant Labels Resource Record (VL RR) provides such variant labels list for that purpose.</description>
