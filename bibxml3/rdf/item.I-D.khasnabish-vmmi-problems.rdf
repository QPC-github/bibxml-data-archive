    <description>In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to the migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual Network Elements (VNEs).  VM migration scheme across IP subnets is needed to implement virtual computing resources sharing across multiple network administrative domains.  Many technologies are involved in the VM migration across DCs.  These technologies are classified and discussed according to their different locations in the inter-DC and intra-DC network.  For the seamless online migration in various scenarios, many problems need to be resolved in the control plane.  The VM migration process should be adapted to these aspects.  We also describe the limitations of various types of virtual local area(VLAN) networking technologies and virtual private networking (VPN) technologies that are traditionally expected to support such migration, mobility, and interconnections.</description>
