    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-future-02.txt</link>
    <description>This draft explores several possible remedies for a set of issues that have been identified with the Session Initiation Protocol's non- INVITE transaction. These proposed solutions are in rough form and have not yet accumulated working group consensus. They range from minor extensions to protocol behavior to fundamentally changing the non-INVITE transaction model.</description>
