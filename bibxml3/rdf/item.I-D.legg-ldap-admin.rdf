    <title>"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Administrative  Model", Steven Legg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-legg-ldap-admin-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document adapts the X.500 directory administrative model for use by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The administrative model partitions the Directory Information Tree (DIT) for various aspects of directory data administration, e.g., subschema, access control, and collective attributes.  The generic framework that applies to every aspect of administration is described in this document.  The definitions that apply for a specific aspect of administration, e.g., access control administration, are described in other documents.</description>
