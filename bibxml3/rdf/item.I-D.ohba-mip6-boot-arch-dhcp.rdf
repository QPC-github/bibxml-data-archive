    <title>"Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping Architecture Using DHCP", Yoshihiro Ohba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ohba-mip6-boot-arch-dhcp-00.txt</link>
    <description>A mobile node needs home address, home agent address and security association with home agent to register with the home agent. The process of obtaining this information is called bootstrapping. This document describes a bootstrapping architecture in which there is some dependency between AAA for network access and AAA for mobility service and DHCP in the visited network is used for carrying Mobile IPv6 bootstrap information to the mobile node. The architecture is based on an assumption that the mobile node uses network access credentials as the seed information without a need to pre-configure any Mobile IPv6 service parameters.</description>
