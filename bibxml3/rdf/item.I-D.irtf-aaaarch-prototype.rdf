    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-aaaarch-prototype-02.txt</link>
    <description>In this document a prototype of an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) server is presented. The prototype is build in accordance with the RFCs 2903, 2904 and 2905. As the AAA concept is a multi-tier concept we have chosen for JAVA Enterprise Beans (J2EE) to build the prototype. New techniques and protocols supported by the J2EE platform are discussed. Web service standards like SOAP are explored. A general architecture of an AAA server is outlined in Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) component architecture.</description>
