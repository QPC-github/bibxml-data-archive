    <description>Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient and reliable flooding of information to its peers.  However the current flooding scopes are limited to either area wide scope or domain wide scope.  There are existing use cases where support of other flooding scopes are desirable.  This document defines new Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which provide support for new flooding scopes as well as additional space for advertising information targeted for the currently supported flooding scopes.  The protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards compatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed with care.</description>
