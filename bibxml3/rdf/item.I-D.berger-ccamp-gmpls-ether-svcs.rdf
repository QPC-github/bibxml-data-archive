    <description>This document describes a method for controlling two specific types of Ethernet switching via Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).  This document supports the types of switching required to implied by the Ethernet services that have been defined in the context of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) G.8011.  Specifically, switching in support of Ethernet private line service and Ethernet virtual private line service.  Support for MEF and ITU defined parameters are also covered.  Some of the extensions defined in this document are generic in nature and not specific to Ethernet.Contents</description>
