    <description>This document describes the specification of Xcast6 (Explicit Multi- unicast (Xcast) for IPv6), a new multicast scheme with complementary scaling properties: Xcast supports a very large number of small multicast sessions.  Xcast achieves this by explicitly encoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead of using a multicast group address.  The difference from the experimental specification which is described in [5058] is that this version eliminates Hop-by-Hop header which sometimes suffers hardware router.</description>
