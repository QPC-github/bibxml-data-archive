    <title>"Geographic extensions for HTTP transactions", Andrew Daviel, Felix Kaegi, Martin Kofahl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daviel-http-geo-header-05.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a method of adding simple geographic position or region information to HTTP transactions using extension headers.  It allows location-based services on the World Wide Web, without the additional overhead of geographic query requests and possibly graphical input.  Extension headers transmit predefined or detected position information to reflect a location that the requesting agent is interested in.  This information may be used by a server to present appropriate position-dependent responses, such as search engine results or weather maps.</description>
