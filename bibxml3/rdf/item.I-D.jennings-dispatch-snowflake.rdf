    <title>"Snowflake - A Lighweight, Asymmetric, Flexible, Receiver Driven Connectivity Establishment", Cullen Jennings, Suhas Nandakumar</title>

    <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (RFC5245) defines protocol machinery for two peers to discover each other and establish connectivity in order to send and receive Media Streams.  This draft raises some issues inherent in the assumptions with ICE and proposes a lightweight receiver driven protocol for asymmetric connectivity establishment.</description>
