    <description>In industrial field/backhaul networks, joint real-time scheduling method is important to make end-to-end flows meet their deadline. This document proposes four joint scheduling methods, and they involve four scenarios: time-slotted industrial backhaul network, regarding industrial backhaul network as a black box system, ignoring delay of industrial backhaul and establishing latency model of industrial backhaul network.</description>
