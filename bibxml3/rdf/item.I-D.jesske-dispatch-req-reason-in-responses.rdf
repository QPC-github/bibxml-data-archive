    <title>"Requirements for the use of the Reason header filed in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) responses", Roland Jesske, Laura Liess</title>

    <description>Although the use of the Reason header field in responses is considered in RFC3326, doing so is not specified for any existing response code.  Nonetheless, the Reason header field has been widely used in responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for failure responses to INVITEs that have been gatewayed to PSTN systems.  This document specifies and formally permits the use of the Reason header field in SIP responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for this and other purposes.</description>
