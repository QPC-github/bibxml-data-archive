    <title>"Use of Internationalized Email Addresses in EPP protocol", Dmitry Belyavsky, James Gould</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-belyavskiy-epp-eai-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses in the EPP protocol.  The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being developed before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email Addresses (EAI), does not support such email addressed.  This document describes an EPP extension that allows EAI addresses to be used with an EPP object mapping like the EPP contact mapping.  TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document is edited in the dedicated github repo (https://github.com/beldmit/eppeai).  Please send your submissions via GitHub.</description>
