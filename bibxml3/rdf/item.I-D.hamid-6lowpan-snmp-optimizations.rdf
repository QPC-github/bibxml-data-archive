    <description>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely deployed application protocol for network management and in particular network monitoring.  This document describe the applicability of SNMP to constrained devices, e.g., nodes in Low-power and Lossy Networks.  We discuss SNMP implementation techniques and we provide deployment considerations.  Our discussion also covers the applicability of MIB modules to constrained devices.</description>
