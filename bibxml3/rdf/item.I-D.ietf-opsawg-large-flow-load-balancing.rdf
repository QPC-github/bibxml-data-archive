    <description>Demands on networking infrastructure are growing exponentially due to bandwidth hungry applications such as rich media applications and inter-data center communications. In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in wired networks that extensively use link aggregation groups and equal cost multi-paths as techniques for bandwidth scaling. This draft explores some of the mechanisms useful for achieving this.</description>
