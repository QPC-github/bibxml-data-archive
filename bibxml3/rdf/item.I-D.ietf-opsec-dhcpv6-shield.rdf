    <description>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting hosts connected to a switched network against rogue DHCPv6 servers.  It is based on DHCPv6 packet-filtering at the layer-2 device at which the packets are received.  A similar mechanism has been widely deployed in IPv4 networks ('DHCP snooping'), and hence it is desirable that similar functionality be provided for IPv6 networks.  This document specifies a Best Current Practice for the implementation of DHCPv6 Shield.</description>
