    <title>"A Routing Request Extension for the HELD Protocol", James Winterbottom, Hannes Tschofenig, Laura Liess</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ecrit-held-routing-05.txt</link>
    <description>For cases where location servers have access to emergency routing information they are able to return routing information with the location information if the location request includes a request for the desired routing information.  This document specifies an extension to the HELD protocol that updates RFC5985, to support this funciton.  Allowing location and routing information to be acquired in a single request response exchange updates RFC6881, as current location acquisition and route determination procedures are separate operations.</description>
