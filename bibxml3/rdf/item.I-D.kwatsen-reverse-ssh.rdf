    <description>This memo presents a technique for a SSH (Secure Shell) server to initiate the underlying TCP connection to the SSH client.  This role reversal is necessary in cases where the SSH client would otherwise be unable to initiate an SSH connection to the SSH server, such as a device "calling home" on its first boot.</description>
