    <title>"Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6", Fernando Gont, Suresh Krishnan, Thomas Narten, Richard Draves</title>

    <description>Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface identifier.  This document describes an extension that causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time.  Changing the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond to the same node.</description>
