    <title>"A Management Request Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Joshua Littlefield</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-littlefield-sipping-mgmt-event-01.txt</link>
    <description>In many environments, firewall, NAT and IP addressing issues make remote management of devices containing SIP user agents difficult. This document defines a SIP event package for notifying a user agent that it should initiate a session with a management entity for management operations. This type of "call-home" management avoids the need to maintain persistent TCP connections, or generate additional STUN traffic, with the management entity. This event package is intended not to tunnel management protocols or otherwise provide management itself, but instead to provide a means for signaling a SIP UA that a management session is desired.</description>
