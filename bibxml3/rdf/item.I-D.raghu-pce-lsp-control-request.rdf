    <description>The stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions provide stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for a model where a Path Computation Client (PCC) delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to a stateful PCE. There are use-cases in which a stateful PCE may wish to request and obtain control of one or more LSPs from a PCC.  This document describes a simple extension to stateful PCEP to achieve such an objective.</description>
