    <description>The maxage-vary-cookie HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows an origin server to instruct caches to serve a stale response if the Date header field-value received with the response is greater than a specified date-valued request cookie.  It can be used to implement a simple view consistency mechanism for read/write applications while extending freshness lifetimes, reducing latency, bandwidth usage, and origin server load in some situations.</description>
