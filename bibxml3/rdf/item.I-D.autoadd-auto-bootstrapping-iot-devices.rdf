    <description>IoT devices are fast getting embedded into our lives, and when put together they have the potential to generate a precise and detailed history of our lives and store them forever.  Their networking and communicational power can be unleashed for malicious and sabotage purposes, by a motivated attacker sitting in the far corner of the world.  Attacks on Industrial IoT systems can cause greater disasters.  It is therefore essential to inculcate the security aspect, right from design to development to operations.  The first operation of an IoT device is to bootstrap itself, and due importance should be placed to ensure that this operation is carried out securely and with due diligence.  However, it's easier said than done, and this paper outlines several approaches for secure automated bootstrapping and also proposes a new method, which is compared against the existing mechanisms for several qualitative factors.</description>
