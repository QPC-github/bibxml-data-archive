    <title>"Efficient XML Interchange Capability for NETCONF", Robert Varga</title>

    <description>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices via exchange of XML messages in textual representation.  Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is a W3C-recommended binary representation of XML Information Set, which is more efficient from both CPU and bandwidth utilization perspective.  This document defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows peers to agree to exchange protocol messages using EXI encoding.</description>
