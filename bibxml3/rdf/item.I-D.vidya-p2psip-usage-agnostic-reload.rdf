    <title>"Usage Agnostic Overlay Operation in RELOAD", Vidya Narayanan</title>

    <description>RELOAD [1] defines an overlay framework for providing peer-to-peer connectivity and storage/retreival primitives for applications. Applications or usages are expected to reside on top of such an overlay.  In general, this is a good design that allows multiple applications to use the same overlay framework.  In such a design, however, there are some decisions to be made in terms of what is an overlay function and what must be defined by a usage.  These decisions should generally be based on whether the particular function is expecting an operation or guarantee from the overlay nodes in general or from a particular usage only.  This type of separation is especially crucial to avoid needing flag days for upgrading nodes in order to accommodate a newer usage version for performing the overlay operation.</description>
