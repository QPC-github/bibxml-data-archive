    <title>"Multicast Extensions for LDP", IJsbrand Wijnands</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wijnands-mpls-ldp-mcast-ext-00.txt</link>
    <description>Forwarding multicast packets efficiently over an MPLS core requires Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) or Multi-Point-to-Multi-Point (MP2MP) LSP's between one or more Ingress routers and one or more Egress routers. For efficient forwarding core LSRs need to replicate labeled multicast packets where the branches of the P2MP/MP2MP tree diverge. This draft specifies LDP extensions that enable it to build P2MP/MP2MP LSPs in a receiver initiated manner.</description>
