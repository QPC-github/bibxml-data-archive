    <title>"Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for  Route Exclusions", Eiji Oki, Adrian Farrel</title>

    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. When a Path Computation Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC to specify as constraints to the path computation abstract nodes, resources, and Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) that are to be explicitly excluded from routes. Such constraints are termed route exclusions. The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs. This document presents PCEP extensions for route exclusions.</description>
