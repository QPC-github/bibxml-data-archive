    <description>Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are proposed in order to secure the neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks.  This document defines lightweight and secure version of the neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks.  The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated Address, register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default router and periodically refresh the registration.  Cryptographically generated address and digital signatures are calculated using elliptic curve cryptography, so that the cryptographic operations are suitable for low power devices.</description>
