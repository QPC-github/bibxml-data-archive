    <title>"Use Cases for an Interface to BGP Protocol", Keyur Patel, Russ White, Susan Hares</title>

    <description>A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and analyzed through some form of Command Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol state and debugging of the protocol.  Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces provides an alternate way to control and diagnose the operation of the BGP protocol.  I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation, analyzing or collecting the protocol data.  This document describes set of use cases for which I2RS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of interfaces to the BGP protocol.</description>
