    <description>This document describes the mechanism to achieve multi-domain service forwarding for NSH. The proposed mechanism adopts a horizontal deployment structure, which divides a multi-domain SFC into several segmental SFCs in the control plane and each domain creates its own SFP independently in data plane. A label is proposed to identify different cross-domain flows at the classifier by extending the metadata of the NSH encapsulation.</description>
