    <title>"Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) - a Simplified Mesh-Softwire Model", Remi Despres</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-despres-softwire-sam-01.txt</link>
    <description>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to statelessly establish tunnels, point-to-multipoint, for packets of an address family that traverse domains whose routing is in another address family (mesh softwires).  It extends tunneling principles of [6rd] to other address-family combination than IPv6 across IPv4 domains.  It thus introduces, for a variety of use cases, a simpler mesh-softwire model than that of [RFC5565].  Among SAM use cases, some are solutions to previously unsolved problems: native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, with optimized paths; multihoming with independent CPEs and provider-aggregatable prefixes; public IPv4 addresses across IPv6-only domains with optimized paths; static sharing of IPv4 addresses, without impact on routing information bases.</description>
