    <description>This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for providing a Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire (PW) over MPLS Packet Switched Networks. The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of Point- to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential applications, Point-to-Multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast Service).</description>
