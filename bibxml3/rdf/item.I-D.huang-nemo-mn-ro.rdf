    <title>"Route Optimization for Mobile Nodes in Mobile Network", Zheng Huang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huang-nemo-mn-ro-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6 mobile network to perform route optimization. The route optimization is possible because mobile router provides a care-of address for mobile nodes in mobile network which we call Virtual Care-of Address (VCoA). The VCoA uses the network prefix of the access network. Mobile nodes register VCoA as its own care-of address with home agent and correspondent nodes. With little modification to mobile nodes and correspondent nodes, mobile router deals with the packets forwarding between them.</description>
