    <title>"Using Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanisms in Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL): The GS2 Mechanism Family", Simon Josefsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-josefsson-kitten-gs2bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/ GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding.  This is an update of RFC 5801 that relaxes the requirement for channel binding support and mutual authentication in the underlying GSS-API mechanism.</description>
