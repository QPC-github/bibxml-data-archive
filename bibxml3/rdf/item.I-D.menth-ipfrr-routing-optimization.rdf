    <title>"Routing Optimization with IP Fast Reroute", Michael Menth, Matthias Hartmann, David Hock</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-menth-ipfrr-routing-optimization-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization of not-via addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs [RFC5286] in IP networks.  The optimization is done only by tuning IP link costs.  Optimization goals for both IP FRR techniques is the maximum link utilization in the failure-free scenario and for a set of failure scenarios such as all single link (and node) failures as well as the failure coverage by LFAs.  For LFAs, the failure coverage is another optimization goal.</description>
