    <description>The purpose of this draft is for discussion in the CLUE working group.  It proposes adding an audio rendering tag to the CLUE framework [I-D.ietf-clue-framework], which makes it possible for the consumer to correctly render audio with respect to video in a multistream video conference.  The solution proposed is in partial response to CLUE Task #10, Does Framework provide sufficient info for receiver?</description>
