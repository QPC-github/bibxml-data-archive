    <description>This document proposes a solution for information distribution in autonomic networks. Information distribution is categorized into two different modes: 1) instantaneous distribution; 2) publication for retrieval. In the former case, the information is sent, propagates and is disposed of after reception. In the latter case, information needs to be stored in the network.  The capabilities to distribute information are basic and fundamental needs for an autonomous network (cf. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference- model]). This document describes typical use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI, such that rich information distribution can be natively supported. The document proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes and suggests an implementation based on GRASP extensions as a protocol on the wire.</description>
