    <title>"SIIT-DC: Dual Translation Mode", Tore Anderson, S.J.M. Steffann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Centre Environments architecture (SIIT-DC), which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6, and/or Network Address Translation to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC environment.  This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay.  The application and/or node is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency.  The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc.</description>
