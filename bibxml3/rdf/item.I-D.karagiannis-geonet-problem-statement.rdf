    <description>This document describes the need of intertwining of IP networking with geographical addressing. As used today, IP routing and addressing are completely unaware of geographic parameters such as coordinates or postal addresses. Possible applications of future Internet-wide geo-networking mechanisms include, but are not limited to, dissemination of IP packets to geographical areas, or precise tracking of package positions during a shipping process, with more use-cases under discussion.</description>
