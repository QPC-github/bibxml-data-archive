        <description>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of creating peer-to-peer connections.  To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer connection, the endpoint's local IP addresses are included in this candidate collection.  However, these addresses are typically private and, as such, their disclosure has privacy implications.  This document describes a privacy-preserving way to share local IP addresses with other endpoints by concealing the addresses with dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.</description>
