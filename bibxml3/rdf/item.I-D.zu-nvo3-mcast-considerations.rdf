    <description>The framework of supporting applications specific multicast traffic in a network using Network Virtualization using Overlays over Layer 3 (NVO3) has been discussed. The various mechanisms and considerations that can be used for delivering those application specific multicast traffic in networks that use NVO3 have been considered.
