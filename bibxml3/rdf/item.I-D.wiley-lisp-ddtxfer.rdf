    <description>This draft describes a protocol for transferring a LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT) between DDT nodes and for notifying DDT nodes that the database has changed.  In the absence of a formally defined protocol the LISP-DDT database is transferred using files containing device configuration commands.  This protocol provides for transferring a complete database or the deltas between two versions of the database.  This document does not describe the use of DDT as part of the LISP mapping service.</description>
