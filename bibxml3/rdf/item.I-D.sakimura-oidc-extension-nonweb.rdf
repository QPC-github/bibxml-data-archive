    <title>"Access Token as per Client Password for Non-Web Protocols", Nat Sakimura, Boku Kihara, Kazuki Shimizu</title>

    <description>This specification describes the usage of the access token as a per client "password" for non-web clients that utilizes password based authentication, and the mechanism to issue such access tokens. Since the access token is used as the password for the client, the existing client application can be used as-is without any change, which is a considerable advantage for the deployment.</description>
