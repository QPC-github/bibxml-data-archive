    <title>"Using HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 With IPsec", Scott Kelly, Sheila Frankel</title>

    <description>This specification describes the use of HMAC in conjunction with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms in IPsec. These algorithms may be used as the basis for data origin authentication and integrity verification mechanisms for the AH, ESP, IKE and IKEv2 protocols, and also as Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs) for IKE and IKEv2. Truncated output lengths are specified for the authentication-related variants, with the corresponding algorithms designated as HMAC-SHA-256-128, HMAC-SHA-384-192, and HMAC-SHA-512-256. The PRF variants are not truncated, and are called HMAC-SHA-PRF-256, HMAC-SHA-PRF-384, and HMAC-SHA-PRF-512.</description>
