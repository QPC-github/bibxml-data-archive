    <title>"STRINT Workshop Position Paper: Levels of Opportunistic Privacy Protection for Messaging-Oriented Architectures", Dave Crocker, Pete Resnick</title>

    <description>Given a concern for pervasive monitoring, messaging information needing protection includes primary payload, descriptive meta-data, and traffic-related analysis.  Complete protection against pervasive monitoring (PM), for traffic through complex handling sequences, has not yet been achieved reliably in real-world operation. Consequently, it is reasonable to consider a range of mechanisms, for protecting differing amounts of information and against monitoring of different kinds.  Although channel-based encryption can be helpful, it is not sufficient.  This paper considers pursuing different levels of end-to-end protection, referencing examples of component mechanisms that already have encouraging field experience.</description>
