    <title>"Didirectional Port Control for PCP", Gang Chen, Hui Deng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-pcp-bidirection-mapping-00.txt</link>
    <description>The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCP could not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage port mapping status for communicating remote peers.  The bi-directional port control mode will eliminate risks of connections interruption caused by remote peer pinhole timeout.</description>
