    <description>This document defines an extension block that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [2] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [4].  This Metadata Extension Block is designed to be used to carry metadata that forwarding nodes can use to make routing and other decisions regarding the bundle.  This block is defined to enable the actual metadata that is inserted into the block to have any content and format, providing the format has been documented as a metadata ontology. Specific metadata ontologies may be defined in additional documents.</description>
