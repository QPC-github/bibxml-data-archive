    <description>Requirements for providing the End to End(E2E) performance assurance are emerging within the service provider networks.  While there are various technology solutions, there is no single solution that can fulfill these requirements for a native IP network.  In particular, there is a need for a universal (E2E) solution that can cover both intra- and inter-domain scenarios.  One feasible E2E traffic engineering solution is the addition of central control in a native IP network.  This document describes various complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the Path Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network.  This solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control technology, providing traffic engineering for native IP networks in a manner that applies equally to intra- and inter-domain scenarios.</description>
