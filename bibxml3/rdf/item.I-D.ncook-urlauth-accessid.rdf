    <title>"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URL Access Identifier Extension", Neil Cook</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ncook-urlauth-accessid-02.txt</link>
    <description>The existing IMAP URL specification (RFC 5092) lists several &lt;access> identifiers and &lt;access> identifier prefixes, that can be used to restrict access to URLAUTH-generated URLs.  However, these identifiers do not provide facilities for new services such as streaming.  This document proposes a set of new &lt;access> identifiers as well as an IANA mechanism to register new &lt;access> identifiers for future applications.  This document updates RFC 5092.</description>
