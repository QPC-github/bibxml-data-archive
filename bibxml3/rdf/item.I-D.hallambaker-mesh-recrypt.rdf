    <description>independent  A messaging infrastructure providing full end-to end security is presented.  Unlike existing approaches such as S/MIME and OpenPGP, Mesh/Recrypt uses proxy re-encryption to preserve full end-to-end security with individual user and device keys in situations such as the user having multiple decryption devices and messages being set to mailing lists.  This document shows the use of Mesh/Recrypt to address the principle use cases Mesh/Recrypt is designed to address.  These include asynchronous messaging such as mail and controlled documents and synchronous messaging applications such as chat, voice and video.
