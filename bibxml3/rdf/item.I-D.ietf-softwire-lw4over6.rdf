    <description>Dual-Stack Lite (RFC 6333) describes an architecture for transporting IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) function from the centralized DS-Lite tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client located in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  This removes the requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the tunnel concentrator and reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per-subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are allocated to the CPEs.</description>
