    <title>"Guidelines for Extending the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)", Joerg Ott, Colin  Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ott-avt-rtcp-guidelines-01.txt</link>
    <description>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used along with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a control channel between media senders and receivers.  This allows constructing a feedback loop to enable application adaptivity and monitoring, among other uses.  The basic reporting mechanisms offered by RTCP are generic, yet quite powerful and suffice to cover a range of uses.  This document provides guidelines on extending RTCP if those basic mechanisms prove insufficient.</description>
