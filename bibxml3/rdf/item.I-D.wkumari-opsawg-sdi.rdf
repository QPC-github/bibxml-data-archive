    <description>Deploying a new network device often requires that an employee physically travel to a datacenter to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared datacenters with "smart-hands" type support.  In many cases, this could be avoided if there were a standard, secure way to initially provision the devices.  This document extends existing auto-install / Zero-Touch Provisioning mechanisms to make the process more secure.
