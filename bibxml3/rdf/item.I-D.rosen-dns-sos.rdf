    <description>Location of a caller is essential to processing an emergency call. Location is needed to correctly route the call, and to correctly dispatch help to the right place. Location can be specified in geographic (latitude, longitude) or civic (country, province, locality) forms. This document proposes a DNS-based mechanism to lookup emergency calling URIs and related emergency information from a known civic location in a specific form. Other companion documents propose a non DNS-based approach to determine civic location from geographic location, and describe how to discover a civic location in the appropriate local form(s) for this application.</description>
