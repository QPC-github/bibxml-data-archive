    <title>"Operational Structure and Organization of YANG Models", Anees Shaikh, Rob Shakir, Kevin D'Souza, Luyuan Fang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-openconfig-netmod-model-structure-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a comprehensive structure that defines how individual models may be composed to configure and operate network infrastructure and services.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG model rooted at a device, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive.</description>
