    <title>"A Usage for Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe)", Alexander Knauf, Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch</title>

    <description>This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access to RELOAD Resources.  Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic primitive for enabling various coordination and notification schemes among distributed peers.  Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained within an access list.  A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers to write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate. This specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a variable name which is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous processes are required.</description>
