        <description>Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and functions so that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or customers.  Network slices need to co-exist on the same network while ensuring slice elasticity in terms of network resource allocation. The Differentiated Service (Diffserv) model allows for carrying multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying on compliant domains and nodes to provide forwarding treatment (scheduling and drop policy) on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv code point.  This document adopts a similar approach to Diffserv and proposes a scalable approach to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS networks.  The solution does not mandate Diffserv to be enabled in the network to provide a specific forwarding treatment, but can co-exist with and complement it when enabled.</description>
