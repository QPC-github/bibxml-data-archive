    <description>This document proposes a method called Most Sharable Wavelength per Segment (MSWS) to support shared-mesh restoration for wavelength switched optical networks (WSON). The proposed method can perform efficient wavelength sharing in a distributed fashion. It uses the signaling extensions for WSON which is previously proposed in the document "Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks" (draft-bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling-01) and no other protocol extensions of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) routing and signaling are needed.</description>
