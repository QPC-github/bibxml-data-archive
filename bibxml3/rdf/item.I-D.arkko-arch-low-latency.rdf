    <title>"Low Latency Applications and the Internet Architecture", Jari Arkko, Jeff Tantsura</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-arkko-arch-low-latency-02.txt</link>
    <description>Some recent Internet technology developments relate to improvements in communications latency.  For instance, improvements in radio communications or the recent work in IETF transport, security, and web protocols.  There are also potential applications where latency would play a more significant role than it has traditionally been in the Internet communications.  Modern networking systems offer many tools for building low-latency networks, from highly optimised individual protocol components to software controlled, virtualised and tailored network functions.  This memo views the developments from a system viewpoint, and considers the potential future stresses that the strive for low-latency support for applications may bring.</description>
