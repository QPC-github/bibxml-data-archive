    <description>TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment. This document introduces Faster Restart, an optional mechanism for safely improving the behavior of interactive flows that use TFRC. Faster Restart is proposed for use with TFRC and with TFRC-SP, the Small Packet variant of TFRC.  We present Faster Restart in general terms as a congestion control mechanism, and further discuss Faster Restart for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control IDs 3 and 4.</description>
