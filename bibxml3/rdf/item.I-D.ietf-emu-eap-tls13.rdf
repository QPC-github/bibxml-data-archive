        <title>"Using EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS 1.3)", John Mattsson, Mohit Sethi</title>

        <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.  This document specifies the use of EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) with TLS 1.3 while remaining backwards compatible with existing implementations of EAP-TLS.  TLS 1.3 provides significantly improved security and privacy, and reduced latency when compared to earlier versions of TLS.  EAP-TLS with TLS 1.3 (EAP-TLS 1.3) further improves security and privacy by always providing forward secrecy, never disclosing the peer identity, and by mandating use of revocation checking, when compared to EAP-TLS with earlier versions of TLS.  This document also provides guidance on authentication, authorization, and resumption for EAP-TLS in general (regardless of the underlying TLS version used).  This document updates RFC 5216.</description>
