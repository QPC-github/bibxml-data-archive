    <title>"Experimental observation of RPL: routing protocol overhead and asymmetric links", Henry-Joseph Audeoud, Martin Heusse</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-audeoudh-rpl-asymmetric-links-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document summarizes our observations of the behavior of RPL on a testbed composed of tens of IEEE 802.15.4 nodes.  Our first observation is that the continuous task of estimating the link metric to all candidate neighbors causes a significant background load. This traffic is persistent, even in a stable network where DIO transmissions are eventually widely spaced.  Next, this document focuses on the case of the presence of an asymmetric link, due to either a muted or a deaf node.  In these circumstances, the standard RPL mechanisms may well generate hundreds of routing messages per node and per hour.</description>
