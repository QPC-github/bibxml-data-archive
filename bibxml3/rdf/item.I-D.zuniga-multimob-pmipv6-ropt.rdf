    <description>The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP multicasting in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224]. In this document, some enhancements are proposed to the base solution. These enhancements include the use of a multicast tree mobility anchor as the topological anchor point for multicast traffic, as well as a direct routing option where the MAG can provide access to multicast content in the local network. These enhancements provide benefits such as reducing multicast traffic replication and supporting different PMIPv6 deployments scenarios.</description>
