    <description>With the related applications of wireless sensor networks getting into our lives quickly, the research of WSN is growing more and more necessary.  The most significant problem which threatens the successful deployment of sensor systems is privacy, there are many protocols providing the security of news content for the WSNs. However, due to the open feature of sensor networks, context information is still in an exposed state, which makes the network be vulnerable to traffic analysis attack and hop by hop tracing back packet attack.  Thus location privacy protection programs have been proposed.  In this paper, we analyze and compare the existing major schemes comprehensively, meanwhile illustrate their theoretical models, principles and the advantages and disadvantages in detail.</description>
