    <description>This document provides a guide for IPv6 deployment in Internet Exchange Points (IXP).  It includes information about the switching fabric configuration, the addressing plan options and general organizational tasks to be performed.  IXP are mainly a layer 2 device (the switching fabric) and in many case the best recommendations state that IPv6 traffic and management should not be handled differently than in IPv4.</description>
