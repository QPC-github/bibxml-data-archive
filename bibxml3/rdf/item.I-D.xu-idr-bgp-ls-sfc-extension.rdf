    <description>The Segment Routing mechanism can be leveraged to realize the service path layer functionality of the Service Function Chaining (i.e, steering traffic through the service function path).  The link-state IGPs (i.e., IS-IS and OSPF) have been extended to advertise service information including services and the corrresponding service segment identifiers.  For the purpose of building service function paths which span across IGP areas, or even across ASes, this draft defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family to carry service information including services and the corrresponding service segment identifiers.</description>
