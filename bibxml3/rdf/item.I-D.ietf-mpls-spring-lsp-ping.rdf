    <description>A Segment Routing architecture leverages source routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to use of a Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with a Segment Routing header.  The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification and fault isolation for an LSP within a Segment Routing architecture. This document illustrates the problem and defines extensions to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP Prefix and Adjacency SIDs with an MPLS data plane.</description>
