    <title>"IP Flow Information Exchange (IPFIX) Testing", Carsten Schmoll, Paul Aitken</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schmoll-ipfix-testing-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a list of tests which implementers of IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) compliant systems are encouraged to perform on their IPFIX system. This document has been created to help implementers test the functionality of their IPFIX exporter and/or collector component. The goal of these tests is to ensure that all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gain a level of confidence in the system which allows the implementer to perform interoperabilty or plug tests with other IPFIX systems.</description>
