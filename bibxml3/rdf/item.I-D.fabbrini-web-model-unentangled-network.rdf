    <title>"A Web Model where Content Is Stored in a File's Source: The Unentangled Network", Michele Fabbrini</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fabbrini-web-model-unentangled-network-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an experimental model of web whose main characteristic is that the content is stored in a file's source and accessed through a common text browser from the command line under Linux Os.  This work also aims to evaluate the implications of such a network in relation, among other aspects, to security and tracking.</description>
