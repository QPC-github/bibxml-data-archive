    <title>"PCC-PCE Communication Requirements for Point to Multipoint Multiprotocol  Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)", Seisho Yasukawa, Adrian Farrel</title>

    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing protocols have been made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The use of PCE in MPLS networks is already established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimes complex to compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs.  Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". This document complements the generic requirements and presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements for point-to-multipoint MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering.</description>
