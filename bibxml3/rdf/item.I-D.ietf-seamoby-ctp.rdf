    <description>This document presents a context transfer protocol that enables authorized context transfers. Context transfers allow better support for node based mobility so that the applications running on mobile nodes can operate with minimal disruption. Key objectives are to reduce latency, packet losses and avoiding re-initiation of signaling to and from the mobile node.</description>
