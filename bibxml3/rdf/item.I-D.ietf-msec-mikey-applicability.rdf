    <title>"On the applicability of various MIKEY modes and extensions", Steffen Fries, Dragan Ignjatic</title>

    <description>Multimedia Internet Keying - MIKEY - is a key management protocol that can be used for real-time applications.  In particular, it has been defined focusing on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol.  MIKEY itself is standardized within RFC3830 and defines four key distribution methods.  Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol.  As MIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base protocol arose, especially in terms of additional key distribution methods, but also in terms of payload enhancements.  This document provides an overview about the MIKEY base document in general as well as the existing extensions for MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process of definition.  It is intended as additional source of information for developers or architects to provide more insight in use case scenarios and motivations as well as advantages and disadvantages for the different key distribution schemes.  The use cases discussed in this document are strongly related to dedicated SIP call scenarios providing challenges for key management in general among them media before SDP answer, forking, and shared key conferencing.</description>
