    <title>"Secure Password Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Dan Harkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-harkins-tls-dragonfly-04.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support certificate-less, secure authentication using only a simple, low-entropy, password.  The exchange is called TLS-PWD.  The ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange protocol, named "dragonfly", that is resistant to off-line dictionary attack.</description>
