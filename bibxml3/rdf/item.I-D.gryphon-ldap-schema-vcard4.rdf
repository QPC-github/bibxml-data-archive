    <title>"LDAP Schema for vCard v4.0", Stephen (Sly) Gryphon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gryphon-ldap-schema-vcard4-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document works to harmonize the vCard directory information card and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) standards by extending both standards to support a common directory card entity.  Additional LDAP attributes and object classes, and additional properties for vCard are defined. A standard mapping process between the two designed to support vCard's goal of being a transport format between directories (not just LDAP) is defined.</description>
