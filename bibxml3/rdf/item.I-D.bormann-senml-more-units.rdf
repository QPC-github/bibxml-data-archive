    <description>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the indication of units for a quantity represented.  This short document registers a number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for Units in SenML.  It also defines a registry for secondary units that cannot be in SenML's main registry as they are derived by linear transformation from units already in that registry.</description>
