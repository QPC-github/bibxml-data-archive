    <description>This document shows some experimental results on SPIT on commercial VoIP services, in which a SIP UA has not been secured by SIP security protocol such as TLS. Although many service providers have been applying the HTTP digest scheme to authenticate a SIP UA, they often do not apply SIP signaling protection against potential threats between the SIP UA and the SIP proxy. This cause vulnerabilities to the VoIP services like SPIT. The aim of this memo is to inform the service providers of SPIT threats by showing some experimental results of SPIT on current VoIP networks.</description>
