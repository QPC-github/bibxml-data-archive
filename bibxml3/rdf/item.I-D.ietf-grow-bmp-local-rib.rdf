        <description>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to local Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by adding access to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as defined in RFC 4271.  The Loc-RIB contains the routes that have been selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision Process.</description>
