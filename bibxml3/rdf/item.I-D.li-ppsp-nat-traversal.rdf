    <description>This document discusses the necessity and solutions of PPSP NAT traversal.  Two NAT traversal solutions based are described in this document: PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE solution.  PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE solutions both use ICE.  PPSP-ICE solution uses PPSP messages to convey ICE parameters, while RELOAD-ICE solution proposes to form a RELOAD overlay with PPSP peers and use RELOAD messages to exchange ICE parameters.  Extensions to PPSP are also proposed to support these solutions.</description>
