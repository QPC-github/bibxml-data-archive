    <title>"Default Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes", Richard Draves, Dave  Thaler</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipv6-router-selection-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an optional extension to Router Advertisement messages for communicating default router preferences and more-specific routes from routers to hosts. This improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate router, especially when the host is multi-homed and the routers are on different links. The preference values and specific routes advertised to hosts require administrative configuration; they are not automatically derived from routing tables.</description>
