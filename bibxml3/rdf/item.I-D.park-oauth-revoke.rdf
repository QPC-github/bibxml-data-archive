    <title>"The OAuth 2.0 Risk notification and Token Revocation from Resource Server", ddukki86@ssu.ac.kr, Minho Park, Souhwan Jung</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-park-oauth-revoke-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes the revocation of an access token in the case that a client uses the access token illegally or maliciously. Contrast to the existing revocation defined in RFC7009, the proposed revocation is initiated by a resource server when the abnormal behaviors of a client such as too many DB queries are detected. The revocation process after revocation initiation is based on RFC7009.</description>
