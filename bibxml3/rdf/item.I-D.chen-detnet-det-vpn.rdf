    <description>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) services are expected to be integrated with VPN technologies.  Such deployment scenarios include mobile backhauls and TSN islands inter-connections.  This document describes an overall VPN framework that provides deterministic transport services (called deterministic VPN), specifies corresponding control and data plane protocols that are required to support the framework, and initially summarizes potential extensions of existing protocols to enable deterministic VPNs.</description>
