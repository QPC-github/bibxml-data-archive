    <title>"Motivation for a Multi-Flow Real-time Transport Protocol", Sathya Narayanan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-narayanan-mrtp-motivation-00.txt</link>
    <description>We proposed a new multi-flow real time protocol (MRTP) in our earlier internet-draft [1] for carrying real-time data through multiple paths between the source and the destination. There are a various advantages in multipath data transport as demonstrated by [2][3] [5][8]. MRTP would provide an end-to-end transport services over multiple flows and paths to real time data. In this draft we discuss the motivation for needing such a standardized protocol to encourage further discussion on the requirement for a multi-path transport protocol.</description>
