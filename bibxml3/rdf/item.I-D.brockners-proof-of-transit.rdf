    <description>Several technologies such as Traffic Engineering (TE), Service Function Chaining (SFC), and policy based routing are used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined path.  This document defines mechanisms to securely prove that traffic transited said defined path.  These mechanisms allow to securely verify whether, within a given path, all packets traversed all the nodes that they are supposed to visit.</description>
