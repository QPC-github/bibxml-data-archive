    <title>"DHCPv6/SLAAC Interaction Implementation Guidance", Bing Liu, Ron Bonica</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-6man-dhcpv6-slaac-implementation-guide-00.txt</link>
    <description>ND and DHCPv6 protocols could have some interaction on address provisioning with the A, M, and O flags defined in ND protocol. But the relevant standard definitions of the flags contain ambiguity, so that current implementations in operating systems have varied on interpreting the flags. The variation might impact real network operations, so this document aims to provide some guidance on what should be the proper implementation on the interaction behavior.</description>
