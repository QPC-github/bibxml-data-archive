    <description>This document describes a set of scenarios in which complications to identify which policy to apply for a host are encountered.  This problem is abstracted as "host identification".  Describing these scenarios allows to identify what is common and then would help during the solution design phase.  The document does not include any solution-specific discussion.</description>
