    <description>This document provides a single reference point for requirements for Relying Party (RP) software for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  It cites requirements that appear in several RPKI RFCs, making it easier for implementers to become aware of these requirements that are segmented with orthogonal functionalities.</description>
