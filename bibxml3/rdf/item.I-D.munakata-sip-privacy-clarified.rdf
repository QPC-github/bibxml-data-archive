    <description>This document defines the privacy mechanisms for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Specifically, guidelines are provided for the creation of messages that do not divulge personal identity information. A "privacy service" logical role for intermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements that user agents cannot satisfy themselves. Finally, means are presented by which a user can request particular functions from a privacy service.</description>
