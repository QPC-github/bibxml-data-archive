        <description>In Situ Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for monitoring network performance and for detecting traffic bottlenecks and anomalies.  This is achieved by incorporating IOAM data into in- flight data packets.  This document introduces the concept of use case-driven IOAM profiles.  An IOAM profile defines a use case or a set of use cases for IOAM, and an associated set of rules that restrict the scope and features of the IOAM specification, thereby limiting it to a subset of the full functionality.  The motivation for defining profiles is to limit the scope of IOAM features, allowing simpler implementation, verification, and interoperability testing in the context of specific use cases that do not require the full functionality of IOAM.</description>
