    <title>"Delay Limits for Real-Time Services", Mirko Suznjevic, Jose Saldana</title>

    <description>Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the Quality of Experience (QoE) of network services.  This document surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated by the users of services with delay constraints.  Some recommendations already exist for e.g.  VoIP, but emerging services as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements.  Different papers in the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a summary of the latency limits for each service is provided.</description>
