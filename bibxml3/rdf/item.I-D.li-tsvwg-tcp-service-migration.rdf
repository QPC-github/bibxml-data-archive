    <description>This document describes a new transport protocol TSMP, which seeks to support data transfer for the emerging usage paradigm of "single user, multiple device" in a TCP compatible manner.  Through its novel proxy-based design, TSMP is able to retain the current client and server protocol operations of the legacy TCP protocol and TCP-based applications while placing new functions at the proxy.</description>
