    <title>"Requirements for Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA)", Hormuzd Khosravi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-khosravi-nea-requirements-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the interface (protocol) requirements between the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) conceptual architecture. NEA provides owners of networks (e.g. an enterprise offering remote access) a mechanism to learn the operational state or posture of a system requesting network access and then apply this knowledge to the network admission decision. In this case, operational posture refers to information about the configuration and use of hardware and software capabilities available or running on the system. This information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking (or have out of date) security protective mechanisms (e.g. anti-virus, firewall.) In order to provide context for the requirements, a conceptual architecture and terminology is introduced. This architecture is provided for informational purposes but is based on the models used by NAC[9], NAP[10] and TNC[8].</description>
