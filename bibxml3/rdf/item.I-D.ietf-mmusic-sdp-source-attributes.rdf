    <title>"Source-Specific Media Attributes in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Jonathan Lennox, Joerg Ott, Thomas Schierl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-source-attributes-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Session Description Protocol provides mechanisms to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to describe individual media sources within a media stream.  This document defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, identified by their Synchronization Source Identifiers (SSRCs), in SDP, associate attributes with these sources, and express relationships among sources.  It also defines several source-level attributes which can be used to describe properties of media sources.</description>
