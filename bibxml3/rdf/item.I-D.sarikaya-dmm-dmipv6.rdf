    <description>As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach is needed to Mobile IPv6.  This document defines a distributed mobility management protocol.  Protocol is based on Mobile IPv6 and its extensions for multiple care of address registration, flow mobility and dual stack mobile IPv6 with minimum extensions.  Control and data plane separation is achieved by separating Home Agent functionalities into the control and data planes.</description>
