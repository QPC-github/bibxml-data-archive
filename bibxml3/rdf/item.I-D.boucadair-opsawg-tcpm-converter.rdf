    <title>"RADIUS Extensions for 0-RTT TCP Converters", Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet</title>

    <description>Because of the lack of important TCP extensions, e.g., Multipath TCP support at the server side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called Transport Converters.  For example, network-assisted Multipath TCP deployment models are designed to facilitate the adoption of Multipath TCP for the establishment of multi-path communications without making any assumption about the support of Multipath TCP by the remote servers.  Transport Converters located in the network are responsible for establishing multi-path communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking advantage of Multipath TCP capabilities to achieve different goals that include (but are not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication paths), and traffic offload management.  This document specifies a new Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry the IP addresses that will be returned to authorized users to reach one or multiple Converters.</description>
