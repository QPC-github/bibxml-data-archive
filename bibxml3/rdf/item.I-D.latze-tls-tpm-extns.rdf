    <description>Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) become more and more widespread in modern desktop and laptop computers and provide secure storage and cryptographic functions.  As one nice feature of TPMs is that they can be identified uniquely, they provide a good base for device authentication in protocols like TLS.  This document specifies a TLS extension that allows to use TPM certified keys with TLS in order to allow for a secure and comfortable device authentication in TLS.</description>
