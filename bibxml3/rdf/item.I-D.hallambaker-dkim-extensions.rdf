    <description>Optional extensions for DKIM are described.  A DKIM Policy statement is defined for the policy 'this zone never sends mail'.  The NULL Key Algorithm is defined to simplify management of large zones where most mail is signed but with important exceptions.  The X509 key record extension allows the location from which an X.509v3 certificate for the key specified in the record may be obtained.</description>
