    <title>"Recommendations for the Remediation of Bots in ISP Networks", Jason Livingood, Nirmal Mody, Michael O'Reirdan</title>

    <description>This document contains recommendations on how Internet Service Providers can manage the effects of computers used by their subscribers, which have been infected with malicious bots, via various remediation techniques.  Internet users with infected computers are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data, as well as increased susceptibility to online fraud.  Such computers can also become an inadvertent participant in or component of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network, as well as be used as a part of a distributed denial of service attack.  Mitigating the effects of and remediating the installations of malicious bots will make it more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime on the Internet in general and/or on a particular Internet Service Provider's network.</description>
