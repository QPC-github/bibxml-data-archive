    <title>"Architectural Implications of Locator/ID Separation", Dave Meyer, Darrel  Lewis</title>

    <description>Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily on the control plane protocols concerned with finding Identifier-to-Locator    mappings. However, experience gained with a trial deployment of a system designed to implement Locator/ID Separation has revealed two general classes of problems which must be resolved after the mapping is found: The Locator Path Liveness Problem and the State Synchronization Problem.  These problems have implications for the data plane as well as the control plane.</description>
