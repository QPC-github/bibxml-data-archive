    <description>Draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies procedures that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE- initiated LSPs in the active stateful PCE model. However, this specification focuses on MPLS networks, and does not cover remote instantiation of paths in GMPLS-controlled networks. This document complements [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] by addressing the requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.</description>
