    <title>"Home Network Prefix Renumbering in PMIPv6", Zhiwei Yan, Jong-Hyouk Lee, XiaoDong Lee</title>

    <description>In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial attachment and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP. During the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to keep ongoing communications associated with the HoA.  However, the current PMIPv6 specification does not specify related operations when an HNP renumbering has happened (e.g. due to change of service provider, change of site topology, etc.).  In this document, a solution to support the HNP renumbering is proposed, as an optional extension of the PMIPv6 specification.</description>
