    <title>"Civic Location Format Extension for Utility and Lamp Post Numbers", Robins George, Henning Schulzrinne, Brian Rosen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-george-geopriv-lamp-post-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension to civic location format and adds two new CAtypes: PN (pole number) and MP (milepost).  Pole Numbers are used on poles such as lamp posts or utility poles, and can be used in some circumstances as location information.  Mileposts are numeric values measured from an end of a trail, road, railway line or other feature.</description>
