    <description>Wavelength Switched Optical Network will extend GMPLS protocols to to manage wavelength across DWDM optical networks.  In many situations the control plane needs to know additional information regarding wavelengths.  The current proposal identify a way to carry some property information along with wavelength information.  Control plane can leverage the knowledge of such properties during its operations.</description>
