    <description>This document gives some basic operational guidelines for an IPv6 site renumbering event. This document considers an renumbering event as several basic operational stages as numbering, adding a new prefix, and deprecating old prefix(es) and guidelines are given according to each stage. Besides the general guidelines, this document also gives some considerations on some specific operations such as ND/DHCPv6 collaboration, DHCPv6 reconfiguration, secure dynamic DNS update and multicast.</description>
