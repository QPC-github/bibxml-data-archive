    <description>Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on environments covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.) and IP/MPLS Packet switched networks. However, there is minimal documentation on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label Switched Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document provides a framework for GMPLS in support of L2 LSPs in several network environments, in particular, Ethernet.</description>
