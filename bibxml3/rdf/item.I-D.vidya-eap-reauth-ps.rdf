    <title>"Problem Statement on EAP Efficient Re-authentication and Key Management", Vidya Narayanan, Lakshminath Dondeti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vidya-eap-reauth-ps-00.txt</link>
    <description>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748 [1] is a generic framework for network access authentication, in which a peer engages in a full EAP conversation each time. A full EAP conversation involves several roundtrips between the peer and the authentication server in the home domain, and that is not acceptable for fast roaming. In this document, we explain the requirements for low-latency EAP re-authentication and associated key management.</description>
