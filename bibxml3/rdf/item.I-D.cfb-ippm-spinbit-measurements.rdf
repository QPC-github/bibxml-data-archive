    <description>This document introduces an additional single bit signal to enhance the spin bit [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin] performance in presence of network impairments and application limited flow.  In addition, it defines two new explicit per-flow transport-layer signals for hybrid measurement of connection loss rate.  The former is a spin-bit dependent signal and uses a single bit.  The latter is a standalone solution based on a two bits loss signal and on alternate marking RFC 8321 [RFC8321].</description>
