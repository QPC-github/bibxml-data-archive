    <title>"A Novel Framework for Inter-area MPLS Optimal Routing", Peng He, Gregor  Bochmann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-he-ccamp-optimal-routing-00.txt</link>
    <description>We propose a novel framework for inter-area MPLS optimal routing. The key to our proposal lies in deploying an overlaid star optical network in the OSPF backbone area and introducing the concept of "virtual area border routers" (v-ABRs). Compared with other proposals, our framework can provide globally optimized inter-area routing and has very good compatibility to existing traditional IP/MPLS routers.</description>
