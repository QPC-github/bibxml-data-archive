    <title>"Standard Configuration of DiffServ Service Classes", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-tsvwg-rfc4594-update-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes service classes configured with DiffServ and identifies how they are used and how to construct them using Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs), and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms.  There is no intrinsic requirement that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class, but for consistent behavior under the same network conditions, configuring networks as described here is appropriate.</description>
