    <title>"GOST R 34.12-2015: Block Cipher "Magma"", Vasily Dolmatov, Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dolmatov-magma-06.txt</link>
    <description>In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits (referred to as "Kyznyechik" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the block cipher with block length of n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits, which is also referred to as "Magma".  The algorithm is an updated version of an older block cipher with block length of n=64 bits described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830).  This document is intended to be a source of information about the updated version of the 64-bit cipher.  It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications by providing information for developers and users of GOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and decryption.</description>
