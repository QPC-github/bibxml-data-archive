    <title>"Media API Requirements for Real-Time Interoperation of Web User Agents", Martin Thomson, Bernard Aboba</title>

    <description>Direct, real-time communications between web user agents (browsers) requires two points of standardization.  The first describes the on- the-wire protocol that is used.  The second is the API that controls and configures what gets put on the wire and how.  The capabilities of the protocol determines the nature of the API.  This document outlines how the constraints imposed upon the API by the protocol.</description>
