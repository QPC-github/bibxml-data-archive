    <title>"Methodology for Benchmarking Network-layer Traffic Control Mechanisms", Richard Watts, Scott Poretsky</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-bmwg-dsmmeth-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of devices that implement traffic control based on classification such as diff-serv code point (DSCP) criteria. The methodology is to be applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate the performance of the traffic control mechanisms. The methodology permits the specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration commands to vary between DUTs. The methodology provides procedures using existing Terminology to benchmark DUT performance traffic control mechanisms applied to physical and logical interfaces using DSCP as the classification criteria. This includes scenarios where Forwarding Congestion occurs due to interface congestion.</description>
