    <title>"MIKEY-SAKKE: Sakai-Kasahara Key Exchange in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)", Michael Groves</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-groves-mikey-sakke-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes MIKEY-SAKKE, a method of key exchange designed for use in IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) [3GPP.33.328] Media Plane Security, but with potential for wider applicability.  The MIKEY-SAKKE mode uses Identifier-based Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value and certificate-less signatures to provide source authentication.  MIKEY-SAKKE has a number of desirable features, including simplex transmission, scalability, low-latency call setup and support for secure deferred delivery.</description>
