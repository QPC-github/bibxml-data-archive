    <description>This document specifies a network-based localized mobility management (NETLMM) protocol which enables mobile nodes remaining reachable while moving across different access routers in a certain access network zone called Edge Mobility Domain (EMD). This protocol requires no extra host stack support and no complex security and signaling interactions between mobile node and the access network. Especially, by utilizing the neighbor Access Router (AR) information, NETLMM can achieve very fast and smooth handover performance to fit the requirements of most real-time and interactive multimedia applications.</description>
