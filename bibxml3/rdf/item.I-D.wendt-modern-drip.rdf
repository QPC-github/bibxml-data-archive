    <title>"Distributed Registry Protocol (DRiP)", Chris Wendt, Harsha Bellur</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wendt-modern-drip-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a protocol for allowing a distributed set of nodes to synchronize a set of information in real-time with minimal amount of delay.  This is useful for registry types of information like identity and telephone numbers with associated routing and ownership information and could be extended to support other distributed real-time information updates as well.</description>
