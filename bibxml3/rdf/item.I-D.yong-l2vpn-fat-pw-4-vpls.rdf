    <description>A pseudowire (PW) is used in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solutions to form any-to-any connections and provide service demuliplexing among Provider Edge routers (PEs), and is normally transported over one single network path. Flow-aware PW enable a PW to take advantage of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or Link Aggregation Groups (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). PW packets with a flow label can be transported over multi-paths. This method can apply to the PWs in a VPLS service.  This document describes how VPLS solutions utilize a PW with a flow label, and defines protocol extension for the provisioning of such PWs.</description>
