    <title>"Optional Advanced Deployment Scenarios for ILNP", R. Atkinson, SN Bhatti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-rrg-ilnp-adv-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an Architectural description and the Concept of Operations of some optional advanced deployment scenarios for the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP), which is an evolutionary enhancement to IP. None of the functions described here is required for the use or deployment of ILNP. Instead, it offers descriptions of engineering and deployment options that might provide either enhanced capability or convenience in administration or management of ILNP-based systems.</description>
