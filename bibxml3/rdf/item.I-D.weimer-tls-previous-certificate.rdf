    <title>"TLS Extension For Indicating A Previously-Seen Server Certificate Chain", Florian Weimer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-weimer-tls-previous-certificate-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a TLS extension which enables a TLS client to send to a TLS server a certificate chain which the client has previously received from the same server.  Server operators are expected to use this information to detect use of fraudulent certificates on the Internet.</description>
