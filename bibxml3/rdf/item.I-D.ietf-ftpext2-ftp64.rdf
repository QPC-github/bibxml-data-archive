    <description>The File transfer protocol(FTP) has a long histroy,, but still being widely used.  The first concept of FTP was described RFC 114, and then was specified in RFC 354.  FTP can work in IPv4 environment and then was extended to IPv6.  RFC 2428 defines IPv6 extensions of FTP. In the IPv6-IPv4 translation scenario, considerations should be applied to FTP client, server and translation box to ensure FTP protocol work properly.  This document discusses the details for FTP to work in IPv4-IPv6 transitiion scenario.  This document gives recommendation regarding how IPv6 FTP client should behave in 6to4 scenario.</description>
