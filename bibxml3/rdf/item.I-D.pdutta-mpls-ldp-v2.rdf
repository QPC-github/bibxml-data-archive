    <description>The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is a protocol defined for distributing labels for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and its procedures are defined in [RFC5036] .  LDP has been one of the most deployed MPLS signaling protocols.  [RFC5036] defines LDP version 1 and this document introduces LDP version 2 to full-fill various operational needs when LDP is deployed for IPV6 networks.  LDP version 1 procedures can support IPV6 Label Switch Path (LSP) setup and this document enhances those procedures in Version 2.</description>
