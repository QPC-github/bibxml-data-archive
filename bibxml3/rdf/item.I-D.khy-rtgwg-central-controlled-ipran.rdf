    <title>"Use Cases and Architecture of Central Controlled IP RAN", Katherine Zhao, Jiehui Hu, So Ning</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-khy-rtgwg-central-controlled-ipran-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces the requirements and use cases for IP RAN (Radio Access Networks). To support the requirements, the document provides an architecture with centralized control plane as well as separation of control plane and data plane.  The document also describes techniques for IP RAN network initialization and construction; interfacing to management plane and third party applications.  This document can be used as a guideline for central controlled IP RAN design and development.</description>
