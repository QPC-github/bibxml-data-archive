    <description>The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible. This memo details the IETF policies on rights in Contributions to the IETF. It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.  This memo obsoletes RFC 3978 and 4748 and, with BCP 79 and RFC xxx (rfc editor - replace with the RFC # of -outgoing), replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026.</description>
