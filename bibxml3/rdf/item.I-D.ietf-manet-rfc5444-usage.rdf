    <title>"Rules for Designing Protocols Using the RFC 5444 Generalized Packet/ Message Format", Thomas Clausen, Christopher Dearlove, Ulrich Herberg, Henning Rogge</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-manet-rfc5444-usage-07.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 5444 specifies a generalized MANET packet/message format and describes an intended use for multiplexed MANET routing protocol messages that is mandated to use on the port or protocol specified by RFC 5498.  This document updates RFC 5444 by providing rules and recommendations for how the multiplexer operates and how protocols can use the packet/message format.  In particular, the mandatory rules prohibit a number of uses that have been suggested in various proposals, and which would have led to interoperability problems, to the impediment of protocol extension development, and to an inability to use optional generic parsers.</description>
