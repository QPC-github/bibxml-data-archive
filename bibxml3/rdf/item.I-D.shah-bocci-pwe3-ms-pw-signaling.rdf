    <description>The pseudowire switching [6] draft describes how a Pseudowire can span across multiple PSN domains. This multi-segment PW (MS-PW) threads through one or more PEs that are not the endpoints of the PW and are called switching PE (S-PE). The switching PE at each hop is configured a-priori with two single hops PW information that enables it to conduct splicing between the two. The configuration of such information at each S-PE for possibly thousands of MS-PWs is cumbersome. We describe a mechanism whereby a S-PE can identify and process the PW control signaling with the information present in the signaling message in a manner that eliminates the requirement to configure PW splicing information. In this mechanism source PE inserts information about the destination PE and the PW endpoint that is recognized by the receiving PE to identify his role as a switching PE and engage in propagating the PW signal towards the destination PE.</description>
