    <title>"Avoiding Equal Cost Multipath Treatment in MPLS Networks", George Swallow</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mpls-ecmp-bcp-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior of currently deployed MPLS networks. This document makes best practice recommendations for anyone defining an application to run over an MPLS network that wishes to avoid the reordering that can result from transmission of different packets from the same flow over multiple different equal cost paths.</description>
