    <title>"Semantic Versioning and Structure for IETF Specifications", Benoit Claise, Richard Barnes, Joe Clarke</title>

    <description>In the Internet engineering ecosystem, there is increasingly a need for specifications that evolve over time, and which are encoded directly in structured formats (e.g., YANG models).  Internet-Drafts are a poor fit for working groups that want to produce structured specifications, and publishing versions of an evolving specification as RFC makes it difficult to track the specification over time.  This document outlines recommendations for how working groups can provide consistent, meaningful versions for specifications over time and work directly on structured documents while still fitting within established IETF processes.</description>
