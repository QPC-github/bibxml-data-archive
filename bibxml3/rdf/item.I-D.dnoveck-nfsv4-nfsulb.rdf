    <title>"Transport-generic Network File System (NFS) Upper Layer Bindings To RPC- Over-RDMA", David Noveck</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dnoveck-nfsv4-nfsulb-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies Upper Layer Bindings to allow use of RPC- over-RDMA by protocols related to the Network File System (NFS). Such bindings are required when using RPC-over-RDMA, in order to enable use of Direct Data Placement and for a number of other reasons.  These bindings are structured to be applicable to all known version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport, including optional extensions.  All versions of NFS are addressed.</description>
