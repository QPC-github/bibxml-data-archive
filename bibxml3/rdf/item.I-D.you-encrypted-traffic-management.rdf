    <title>"The Effect of Encrypted Traffic on the QoS Mechanisms in Cellular Networks", Jianjie You, Chunshan Xiong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-you-encrypted-traffic-management-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a detailed description of the QoS mechanisms of the 3GPP network and why encrypted IP traffic makes current QoS management mechanisms almost useless.  Finally, we propose some ideas to solve this conflict to allow QoS mechanisms to be applied to encrypted IP traffic whilst maintaining the confidentiality of the IP traffic.</description>
