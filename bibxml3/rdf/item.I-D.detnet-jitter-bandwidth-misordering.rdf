    <description>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can provide data transmission with end-to-end bounded latency and extremely low packet loss for user's services.  In order to better control and manage deterministic network services.  It is necessary to measure and monitor DetNet QoS information.  As introduced in [I-D.chen-detnet-loss-delay], packet loss rates and end-to-end delay can be measured by using passive Performance Measurement (PM) in MPLS-based DetNet encapsulation.  This document implement three new QoS related attribute to support passive Performance Measurement for DetNet service.</description>
