    <title>"Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for DNSSEC", Paul Wouters, Ondrej Sury</title>

    <description>The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non- existence.  To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This document defines the current algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC.  This document obsoletes RFC-6944.</description>
