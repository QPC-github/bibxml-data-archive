    <title>"Security requirements for the Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE)  protocol", Haitham Cruickshank</title>

    <description>The MPEG-2 standard defined by ISO 13818-1 [ISO-MPEG2] supports a range of transmission methods for a range of services. This document provides a threat analysis and derives the security requirements when using the Transport Stream, TS, to support an Internet network-layer using Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) [RFC4326]. The document also provides the motivation for link-level security for a ULE Stream. A ULE Stream may be used to send IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets, and other Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to an arbitrarily large number of Receivers supporting unicast and/or multicast transmission.</description>
