    <title>"Validation of Neighbor Discovery Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA) and Target Link-layer Address (TLLA) options", Fernando Gont, Ron Bonica, Will</title>

    <description>This memo documents two scenarios in which an on-link attacker emits a crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packet that poisons its victim's neighbor cache.  In the first scenario, the attacker causes a victim to map a local IPv6 address to a local router's own link- layer address.  In the second scenario, the attacker causes the victim to map a unicast IP address to a link layer broadcast address. In both scenarios, the attacker can exploit the poisoned neighbor cache to perform a subsequent forwording-loop attack, thus potentially causing a Denial of Service.  Finally, this memo specifies simple validations that the recipient of an ND message can execute in order to protect itself against the above-mentioned threats.</description>
