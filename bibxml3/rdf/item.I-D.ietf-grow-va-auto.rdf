    <description>Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va] requires configuration of a static "VP-List" on all routers.  The VP-List allows routers to know which prefixes may or may not be FIB- installed.  This draft specified an optional method of determining this that requires far less configuration.  Specifically, it requires the configuration of a "VP-Range" in ASBRs connected to transit and peer ISPs.  A Non-transitive Extended Communities Attribute is used to convey to other routers that a given route can be FIB-suppressed.</description>
