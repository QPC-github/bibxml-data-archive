    <title>"V5 Level two and three Over IP", Quoc Chinh Nguyen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-q-chinh-n-sigtran-ipv523-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes the use TCP/IP as the transport protocol for V5. The migration from the current trunk 2048 kbps physical to an IP based transport will reduce the cost associated with dedicated trunk based link. Also, the current signaling End-to-End will be unchanged to make the transition seamless as possible.</description>
