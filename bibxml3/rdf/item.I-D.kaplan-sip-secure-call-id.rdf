    <title>"A Secure Call-ID for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan</title>

    <description>Many SIP devices generate Call-ID values which contain their system IP Address, due to examples and normative text in RFC 3261.  This  Kaplan  Expires September 1, 2009  [page 1]  SIP Secure Call-ID  March 2009  has led to some middleboxes, such as SBC's, to change the Call-ID for security reasons.  This draft updates RFC 3261 to require SIP User Agents to generate benign Call-IDs, in such a manner that they can be detected as secure and not need to be changed.</description>
