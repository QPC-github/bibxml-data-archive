    <description>The document describes an IPv6 header compression format for transmission of IPv6 packets in 6LoWPAN networks. Specifications of the compression format rely on specific contexts for which the implementation of fragmentation and defragmentation/reassembly is not recommended. Specifications include frameworks for compressing and decompressing header as well as compression and decompression of source and destination addresses. This document complements "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams in 6LoWPAN Networks", [draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-07].</description>
