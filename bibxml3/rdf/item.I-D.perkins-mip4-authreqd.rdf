    <description>Some implementations of Mobile IP home agents have been observed to supply zero authentication data when sending a Registration Reply to the mobile node that contains rejection code 131 (Mobile Node Failed Authentication).  This creates a vulnerability whereby a mobile node could be denied service from its home agent, and thus lose connectivity to the Internet even though mobile node and home agent were otherwise functioning properly.</description>
