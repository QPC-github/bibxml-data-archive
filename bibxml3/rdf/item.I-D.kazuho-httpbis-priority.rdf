    <title>"Extensible Prioritization Scheme for HTTP", Kazuho Oku, Lucas Pardue</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kazuho-httpbis-priority-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses. This scheme expresses the priority of each HTTP response using absolute values, rather than as a relative relationship between a group of HTTP responses.  This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing the responses.  These share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility.</description>
