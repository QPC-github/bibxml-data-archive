    <description>The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations which implemented parts of PvD architecture document.  One implementation was done from scratch (PvD-manager) while another is a part of an existing component (NetworkManager).  The implementation of server component was also done but only in IPv6 router.  DHCP was ignored due to IPR claims.</description>
