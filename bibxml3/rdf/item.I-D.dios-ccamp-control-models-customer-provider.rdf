    <title>"Terminology and Models for Control of Traffic Engineered Networks with Client-Server Relationship", Oscar Gonzalez de Dios, Julien Meuric, Daniele Ceccarelli</title>

    <description>Different kinds of relationships can be established among interconnected Traffic Engineered Networks.  In particular, this document focuses on the case where there is a client-server relation between the network domains.  The domain interconnection is a policy and administrative boundary.  This informational document collects current terminology and provides a taxonomy for the posible control plane based operation models.  Each control model defines, on the one hand, the level of information that the domain acting as client receives by control plane means from the domain acting as server and, on the other hand, the control model will determine what can be requested from the client domain to the server domain.</description>
