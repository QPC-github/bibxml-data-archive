    <description>IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) OAM facilities. CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV (type, length, value) structured information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA Considerations for the assignment of values from these blocks.
