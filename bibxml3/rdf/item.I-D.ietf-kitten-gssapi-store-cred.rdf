    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-kitten-gssapi-store-cred-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new function for the GSS-API which allows applications to store delegated (and other) credentials in the implicit GSS-API credential store.  This is needed for GSS-API applications to use delegated credentials as they would use other credentials.</description>
