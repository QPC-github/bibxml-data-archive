    <title>"PANA Mobility Optimizations with Session Keys Context (SKC)", Dan Forsberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-forsberg-pana-skc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This specification describes an extension to the PANA protocol that enables usage of a AAA Proxy acting as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for multiple local PANA Authentication Agents. The AAA Proxy acts as the contact point towards the AAA home server (single SA) and a AAA server and KDC towards the PAAs. This document assumes that the local network has multiple PAAs. To avoid signalling between PAAs and the KDC, a Session Key Context is also defined which permits to the KDC to proactively provide a set of keys to a PAA. Session Keys can then be fetched using CXTP.</description>
