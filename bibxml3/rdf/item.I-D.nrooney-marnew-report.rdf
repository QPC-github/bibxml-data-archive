    <title>"IAB Workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW) Report", Natasha Rooney</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nrooney-marnew-report-03.txt</link>
    <description>The MarNEW workshop aimed to discuss solutions for badnwidth optimisation on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted content which is not indicative of the security needs of today's internet users.  The workshop gathered IETF attendees, IAB members and various organisations involved in the telecommunications industry including original equipment manufacturers and mobile network operators.  The group discussed the current internet encryption trends and deployment issues identified within the IETF, and the privacy needs of users which should be adhered.  Solutions designed around sharing data from the network to the endpoints and vice versa were then discussed as well as analysing whether the current issues experienced on the transport layer are also playing a role here.  Content providers and CDNs gave an honest view of their experiences delivery content with mobile network operators.  Finally, technical responses to regulation was discussed to help the regulated industries relay the issues of impossible to implement or bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators.  A group of suggested solutions were devised which will be discussed in various IETF groups moving forward.</description>
