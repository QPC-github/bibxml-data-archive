    <description>This document defines an HTTP header that allows the partitioning of a single origin (as defined in RFC 6454) into multiple origins, so that the same origin policy applies among them.  The header introduced in this document allows a portal to specify that resources that appear to be from the same origin should, in fact, be treated as though they are from different origins, by extending the 3-tuple of the origin to a 4-tuple.  A compliant user agent is expected to apply the same-origin policy according to the 4-tuple rather than the 3-tuple.</description>
