    <description>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS), and dynamic provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning, and covers control plane addressing, routing, path computation, signaling, traffic engineering,, and path recovery.  MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs and provides for compatibility with MPLS.  The control plane for Pseudowires (PWs) is also covered by this document.  Management plane functions such as manual configuration and the initiation of LSP setup are out of scope of this document.</description>
