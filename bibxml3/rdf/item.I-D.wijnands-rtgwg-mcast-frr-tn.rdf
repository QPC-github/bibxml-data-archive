    <description>This draft proposes dataplane triggered Tree Notifications to support multicast fast reroute for PIM and mLDP.  These Tree Notifications are initiated by a node detecting the failure to a Repair Node downstream.  A Repair Node is a node that has a pre-built backup path that can circumvent the failure.  Using this mechanism, a Repair Node has the ability to learn about non-local failures quickly without having to wait for the IGP to convergence.  This draft also covers an optional method to avoid bandwidth usage on the pre-built backup path.</description>
