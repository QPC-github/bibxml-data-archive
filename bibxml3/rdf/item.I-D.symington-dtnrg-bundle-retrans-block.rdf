    <title>"Delay-Tolerant Networking Retransmission Block", Susan Symington</title>

    <description>This document defines an optional extension block, called a Retransmission Block, that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [2] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [4].  The Retransmission Block (RB) is designed to be inserted by a custodian when re-forwarding a bundle, so as to mark the bundle as a legitimate custody-based retransmission rather than an unauthorized bundle duplicate.  By providing a way for nodes that receive the re- forwarded bundle to distinguish it from an unauthorized duplicate, the RB enables those nodes whose local security policies do not permit them to forward replayed bundles to detect and delete unauthorized bundle replays but forward authorized custody-based bundle retransmissions.  This document defines the format and processing of this new Retransmission Block.</description>
