    <description>This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP.  The emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LP-WAN) present a particular set of constraints, which places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense networks, delay- tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks.  The main objectives of LP-WAN signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of technology-independence (L2-independence).  This document describes the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as the main signaling protocol for LP-WAN, over which minimal messages are exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as authentication, authorization, and management.  The use of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to different LP-WAN technologies.</description>
