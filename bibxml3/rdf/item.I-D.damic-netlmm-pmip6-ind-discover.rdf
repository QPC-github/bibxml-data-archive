    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol that enabes mobility management for an IP host as it moves across different points of attachment within the mobility domain.  An IP host whose mobility is being managed by the network is unaware of the access networks capability to do mobility management on its behalf using Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host is informed of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support, as well as how to actively discover such capability in the network that host attaches to.  The ability of the host to discover or be aware of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support in the access network enables better decision making in terms of the network selection and attach procedure as well as the choice of mobility management.</description>
