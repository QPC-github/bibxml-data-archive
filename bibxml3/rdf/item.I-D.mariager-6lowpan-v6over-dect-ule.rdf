    <description>DECT Ultra Low Energy is a low power air interface technology that is defined by the DECT Forum and specified by ETSI.  The DECT air interface technology has been used world-wide in communication devices for more than 15 years, primarily carrying voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for data centric services.  The DECT Ultra Low Energy is a recent addition to the DECT interface primarily intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as sensor devices, smart meters, home automation etc.  As the DECT Ultra Low Energy interface inherits many of the capabilities from DECT, it benefits from long range, interference free operation, world wide reserved frequency band, low silicon prices and maturity.  There is an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE such as for Internet of Things applications.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported over DECT ULE using 6LoWPAN techniques.</description>
