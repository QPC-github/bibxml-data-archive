    <title>"DNA Solution: Link Identifier based approach", Syam Madanapalli, JinHyeock  Choi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jinchoi-dna-protocol2-01.txt</link>
    <description>DNA solution consists of 1)link identity detection with a single RA and 2)quick RA acquisition. This draft presents the first component based on Link Identifier. It describes a way for link identity detection with prefix based Link Identifier, 'linkid prefix'. While this document doesn't include the second component, any quick RA acquisition scheme will work with the proposal. The draft is the result of DNA DT discussion.</description>
