    <title>"Signature Authentication in IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Joel Snyder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kivinen-ipsecme-signature-auth-07.txt</link>
    <description>The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve groups, and there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group.  This document generalizes IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature method supported by the PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism, and is not limited to ECDSA, but can also be used with other signature algorithms.</description>
