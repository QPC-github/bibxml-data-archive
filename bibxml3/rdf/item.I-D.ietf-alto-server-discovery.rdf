    <description>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers.  This document specifies a procedure for resource consumer initiated ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is embedded in the resource consumer.</description>
