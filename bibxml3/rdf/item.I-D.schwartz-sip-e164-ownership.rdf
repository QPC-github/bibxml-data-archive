    <description>When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then problems occur with E.164 number ownership.  Additionally, there are security challenges when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate and authorize the calling party.  Without addressing these two aspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent.  This document aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, not investigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIP Identity").  Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.</description>
