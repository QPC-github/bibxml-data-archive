    <description>Digital signatures are used to sign messages, X.509 certificates and CRLs.  This document updates the "Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List Profile" (RFC3279) and describes the conventions for using the SHAKE function family in Internet X.509 certificates and revocation lists as one-way hash functions with the RSA Probabilistic signature and ECDSA signature algorithms.  The conventions for the associated subject public keys are also described.</description>
