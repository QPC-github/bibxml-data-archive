    <description>This document describes a generic architecture for the service automation management (SAM) which can be used to deploy service across networks models specified in IETF.  It describes the basic architecture, the components, and interfaces used for service automation control and configuration.  However, this document does not propose protocols or extensions to existing protocols but shows how service requests from customer applications can be realized in the way more programmable and agile manner and mapped to the corresponding protocols and network elements.</description>
