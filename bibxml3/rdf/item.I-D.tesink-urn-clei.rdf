    <title>"A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for the CLEI Code", Kaj Tesink</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tesink-urn-clei-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace [RFC3406] that is managed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc., as the maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213 [T1.213], for the assignment of the CLEI Code, for usage within messages standardized by ANSI. The CLEI code is a globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent code assigned by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment suppliers. The CLEI code identifies communications equipment by specifying product type and features. There is a one-to-one relationship between a CLEI Code and supplier’s Product ID (Manufacturer's name, part number along with it's version number).</description>
