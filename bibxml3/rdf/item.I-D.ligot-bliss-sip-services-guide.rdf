    <title>"Providing guidance for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services", Arnaud  Ligot, Thomas Froment</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ligot-bliss-sip-services-guide-02.txt</link>
    <description>Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and services requires to use numerous specifications.  Today, for each service in the scope of BLISS, one can already find references to many possible specifications which do not cover the same things. Some of them are primitive operations, requirements or call flow examples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not be compared at the same level.  Very often, architecture hypothesis are hidden behind the same service name, either assuming that an intermediary; like an application server, has an active role in the service, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end model where only endpoint implementations are involved.  The goal of this document is not to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but to give an overview of every standard specification related to these services, centralizing and categorizing them as input to the working group.</description>
