        <title>"The OPAQUE Asymmetric PAKE Protocol", Daniel Bourdrez, Hugo Krawczyk, Kevin Lewi, Christopher Wood</title>

        <description>This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise. In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to hide the password from the server, even during password registration. This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol and one instantiation based on 3DH.</description>
