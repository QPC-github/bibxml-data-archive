    <title>"IPv4 Extension Headers and UDP Encapsulated Extension Headers", Tom Herbert</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-herbert-ipv4-udpencap-eh-01.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines extension headers for IPv4 and a method to encapsulate extension headers in UDP to facilitate transmission over the Internet, as well as a definition of an IPv4 flow label. The goal is to provide a uniform and feasible method of extensibility that is shared between IPv4 and IPv6.</description>
