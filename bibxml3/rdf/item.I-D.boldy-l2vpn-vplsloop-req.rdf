    <title>"VPLS External Loop Detection and Protection Requirements", Richard Boldy</title>

    <description>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) implementations, as defined in [RFC4761] and [RFC4762], are highly susceptible to layer-2 loops external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such loops impact performance and can have a detrimental affect on all VPLS traffic throughout the entire instance under certain conditions.  Current Layer-2 loop detection and protection mechanisms do not function effectively here.  This document describes the requirements for a protocol function to offer VPLS service providers a mechanism for detecting such layer-2 loops and facilitating configurable actions without the need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other VPLS PEs or customer sourced frames.</description>
