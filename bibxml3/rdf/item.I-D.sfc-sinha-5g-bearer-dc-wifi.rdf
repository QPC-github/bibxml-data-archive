    <description>This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be developed for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of user's data in a scenario of dual-connectivity for non-3GPP access outlinig the poor wifi coverage issues. This document also outlines the faster user data mechanism accompanying non-3GPP access of 5G user device via split bearer in case of a poor coverage.</description>
