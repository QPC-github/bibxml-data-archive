    <description>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput in MPLS networks.  This document describes how these mechanisms can be used for performance measurement of delay and loss in Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.</description>
