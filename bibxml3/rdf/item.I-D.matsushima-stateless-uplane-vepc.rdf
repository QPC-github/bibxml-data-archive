    <title>"Stateless user-plane architecture for virtualized EPC (vEPC)", Satoru Matsushima, Ryuji Wakikawa</title>

    <description>We envision a new mobile architecture for the future Evolved Packet Core (EPC).  The new architecture is designed to support the virtualization scheme called NFV (Network Function Virtualization). In our architecture, the user plane of EPC is decoupled from the control-plane and uses routing information to forward packets of mobile nodes.  Although the EPC control plane will run on hypervisor, our proposal does not modify the signaling of the EPC control plane. The benefits of our architecture are 1) scalability, 2) flexibility and 3) Manageability.  How to run the EPC control plane on NFV is out of our focus in this document.</description>
