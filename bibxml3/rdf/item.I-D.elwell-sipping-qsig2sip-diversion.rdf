    <title>"Interworking between SIP and QSIG for call diversion", John Elwell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-sipping-qsig2sip-diversion-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known as enterprise networks) for calls that undergo diversion. SIP is an Internet application-layer control (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of Ecma Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.</description>
