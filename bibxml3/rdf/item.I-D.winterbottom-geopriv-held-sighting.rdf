    <description>A Geopriv sighting protocol is described that is used for retrieving location information from a server within an access network. The protocol includes options for retrieving location information either by-value or by-reference. The protocol supports mobile and nomadic devices through Location URIs and location update URIs, which enables generation of location information at the Device. The protocol is an application-layer protocol that is independent of session-layer; an HTTP, web services binding is specified.</description>
