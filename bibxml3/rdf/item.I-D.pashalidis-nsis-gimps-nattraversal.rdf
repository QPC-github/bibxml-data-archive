    <title>"GIST NAT Traversal", Andreas Pashalidis, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pashalidis-nsis-gimps-nattraversal-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a number of mechanisms for the implementation of the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol [1] on different types of Network Address Translator (NAT). The focus of these mechanisms is the interaction of GIST with the address translation function of the NAT, and their purpose is to enable GIST hosts that are located on either side of the NAT to correctly interpret signalling messages with respect to the data traffic they refer to. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to people that implement GIST and NSLPs on both NAT and non-NAT nodes.</description>
