    <title>"ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP", Philip Zimmermann, Alan Johnston, Jon Callas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zimmermann-avt-zrtp-22.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines ZRTP, a protocol for media path Diffie-Hellman exchange to agree on a session key and parameters for establishing unicast Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sessions for VoIP applications.  The ZRTP protocol is media path keying because it is multiplexed on the same port as RTP and does not require support in the signaling protocol.  ZRTP does not assume a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or require the complexity of certificates in end devices.  For the media session, ZRTP provides confidentiality, protection against man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, and, in cases where the signaling protocol provides end-to-end integrity protection, authentication.  ZRTP can utilize a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute to provide discovery and authentication through the signaling channel.  To provide best effort SRTP, ZRTP utilizes normal RTP/AVP profiles.  ZRTP secures media sessions which include a voice media stream, and can also secure media sessions which do not include voice by using an optional digital signature.</description>
