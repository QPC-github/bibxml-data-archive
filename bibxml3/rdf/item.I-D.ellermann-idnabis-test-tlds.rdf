    <title>"Reserved Top Level DNS Names", Frank Ellermann, Donald Eastlake 3rd</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ellermann-idnabis-test-tlds-12.txt</link>
    <description>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, a few top level domain names are reserved for use in private testing, as examples in documentation, and the like.  In addition, a few second level domain names reserved for use as examples are documented.  This memo replaces RFC 2606 reserving 21 additional TLDs.</description>
