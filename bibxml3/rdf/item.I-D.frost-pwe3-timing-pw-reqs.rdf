    <title>"Requirements for Pseudo Wires carrying Timing and Synchronization", Tim  Frost</title>

    <description>This document describes the requirements for the transmission of network timing and synchronization across packet-switched networks using pseudo-wires. Such services enable the function of real-time, synchronous applications across the asynchronous packet switched network. In particular, it complements the emulation of TDM bit streams over the packet switched network.</description>
