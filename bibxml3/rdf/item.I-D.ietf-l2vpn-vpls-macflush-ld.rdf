    <title>"MAC Flush Loop Detection in VPLS", Paul Kwok, Pranjal Dutta</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-l2vpn-vpls-macflush-ld-03.txt</link>
    <description>MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change.  Failure of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of control plane in the PE-rs nodes.  This document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.</description>
