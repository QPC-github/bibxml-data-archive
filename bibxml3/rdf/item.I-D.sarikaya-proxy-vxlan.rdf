    <title>"Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network over IEEE 802.1Qbg", Behcet Sarikaya, Frank Xia</title>

    <description>In data centers there is interest in offloading network functions to the switches in order to keep the server focused on computation not networking.  IEEE 802.1Qbg or Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator (VEPA) at the hypervisor simply forces each VM frame sent out to the external switch regardless of destination.  In this case, the eXtensible Local Area Network operation or proxying at a higher level switch is needed.  Communication functions of the eXtensible Local Area Network are moved above to the Top of Rack switches.  Top of Rack switch encapsulates the packets and directs them to their destination.  Packets from the eXtensible Local Area Network servers are decapsulated before sending it to the destination proxy servers.</description>
