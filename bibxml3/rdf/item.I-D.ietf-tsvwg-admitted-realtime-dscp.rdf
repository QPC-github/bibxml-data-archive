    <description>This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for a class of real-time traffic.  This class conforms to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior.  It is also admitted using a CAC procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission. This differs from a real-time traffic class conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior but not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse capacity admission.
