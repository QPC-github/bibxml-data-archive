    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the DYMO routing process.  The DYMO-MIB also reports state information, performance information, and notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state, performance and notification information is useful to management operators troubleshooting DYMO routing problems.</description>
