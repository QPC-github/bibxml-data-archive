    <description>This document describes a simplified algorithm for performing computational comparisons.  The design goal is to achieve an approach that uses the smallest amount of logic.  Necessary secondary goals include an approach that is language agnostic, fast, extensible, and more predictable than other similar algorithms.</description>
