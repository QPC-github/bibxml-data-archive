    <title>"Analysis of the Core-Edge Separation architectures considered by the RRG in 2010", Robin Whittle</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-whittle-rrg-ces-00.txt</link>
    <description>This ID will contain my analysis of the Core-Edge Separation architecture (CEE) scalable routing proposals considered by the RRG in 2010, as well as some other CES architectures.  This ID is to support and document the IRTF Routing Research Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010.  It is not a formal product of the RRG.  To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.</description>
