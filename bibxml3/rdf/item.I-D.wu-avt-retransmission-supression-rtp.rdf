    <title>"RTCP Extension for Feedback Suppression Indication", Wenson Wu, Frank Xia, Roni Even</title>

    <description>In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in RFC 4585, a media source or middlebox may experience transient overload if some event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at once.  This feedback implosion can be mitigated if the device suffering from overload can send a third party loss report message to the receivers to inhibit further feedback.  This memo defines RTCP extensions for third party loss report, to suppress NACK and FIR feedback requests.  It also defines associated SDP signalling.</description>
