    <description>The Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2) protocol does not have a mechanism for a node to repel transit traffic if it is on the shortest path.  This document defines a bit (Host-bit) that enables a router to advertise that it is a non-transit router.  It also describes the changes needed to support the H-bit in the domain.  In addition, this document updates RFC 6987 to advertise type-2 External and Not-So-Stubby-Area (NSSA) Link State Advertisements (LSAs) with a high cost in order to repel traffic effectively.</description>
