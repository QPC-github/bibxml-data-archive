    <description>There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts of hosts in the data center.  These issues include the prevalent use of IP Multicast within the Data Center.  Its important to understand how IP Multicast is being deployed in the Data Center to be able to understand the surrounding issues with doing so.  This document provides a quick survey of uses of multicast in the data center and should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to large amounts of multicast in the data center.</description>
