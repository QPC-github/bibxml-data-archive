        <title>"Identity Module for TLS Version 1.3", Pascal Urien</title>

        <description>TLS 1.3 will be deployed in the Internet of Things ecosystem. In many IoT frameworks, TLS or DTLS protocols, based on pre-shared key (PSK), are used for device authentication. So PSK tamper resistance, is a critical market request, in order to prevent hijacking issues. If DH exchange is used with certificate bound to DH ephemeral public key, there is also a benefit to protect its signature procedure. The TLS identity module (im) MAY be based on secure element; it realizes some HKDF operations bound to PSK, and cryptographic signature if certificates are used. Secure Element form factor could be standalone chip, or embedded in SoC like eSIM.</description>
