    <title>"Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations", Niels ten Oever, Corinne Cath</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-hrpc-research-14.txt</link>
    <description>This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973].  If you want to apply this work to your own, you can directly go to Section 6.  The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines and how they were developed.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.  This informational document has consensus for publication from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol Considerations Research Group.  It is the first milestone in a longer term research effort and has been reviewed both by the research group and by individuals from outside the research group.  Many of the topics discussed are still under discussion in the research group and will be subjects of continuing research.</description>
