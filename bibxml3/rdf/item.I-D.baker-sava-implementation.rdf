    <description>This note describes how Source Address Validation might be applied in an IPv6 environment.  Local systems should be able to ensure that their peers are using the IPv6 source addresses that the routing system uses to deliver data to them.  Remote systems should be able to ensure that traffic they forward has reasonable source addresses.</description>
