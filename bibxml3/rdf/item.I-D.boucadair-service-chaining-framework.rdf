    <description>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions) for the delivery of added value services.  This document defines a framework to enforce Service Function Chaining (SFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.  The proposed framework allows for Differentiated Forwarding (DiffForward): packets are initially classified and marked at the entry point of an SFC-enabled domain, and are then forwarded on a per SF Map Index basis.</description>
