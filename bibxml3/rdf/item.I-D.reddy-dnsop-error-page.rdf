        <description>When a DNS server filters a query, the response to such query conveys no detailed explanation that elaborates why that query was blocked, leading thus to end-user confusion.  A solution to this problem is needed in order to enhance the user experience.  This document defines a method to return an URI that explains the reason why a DNS query was filtered by a DNS server.</description>
