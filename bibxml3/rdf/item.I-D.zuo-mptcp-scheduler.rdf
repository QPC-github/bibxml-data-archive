    <description>Scheduling schemes play a key role in the performance of multipath transport protocols. A path-aware scheduling scheme for latency- sensitive applications is proposed, which always schedules data in the path with the lowest One-Way Latency (OWL). The OWLs of all paths are obtained by employing the redundant transmission periodically.</description>
