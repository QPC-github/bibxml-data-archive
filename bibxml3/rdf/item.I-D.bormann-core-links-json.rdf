    <description>Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  Outside of constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627).  This specification defines a common format for representing Web links in JSON format.</description>
