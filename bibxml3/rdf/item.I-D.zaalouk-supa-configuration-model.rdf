    <description>Currently new services create new opportunities for both network providers and service providers. Shared Unified Policy Automation (SUPA) can provide application-based policies and means to model and program the abstract view of network infrastructure and service function interdependencies in order to support and feed network management and controlling. Such network management and controlling services that provide the required configuration and application programming interfaces may need a set of specified YANG models to achieve the aforementioned goal. This document defines a YANG data model for SUPA configuration.</description>
