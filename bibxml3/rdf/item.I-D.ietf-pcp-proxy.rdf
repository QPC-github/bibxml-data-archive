    <description>This document specifies a new PCP functional element denoted as a PCP Proxy.  The PCP Proxy relays PCP requests received from PCP clients to upstream PCP server(s).  A typical deployment usage of this function is to help establish successful PCP communications for PCP clients that can not be configured with the address of a PCP server located more than one hop away.</description>
