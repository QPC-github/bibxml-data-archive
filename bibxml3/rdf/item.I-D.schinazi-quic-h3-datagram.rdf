    <title>"Using QUIC Datagrams with HTTP/3", David Schinazi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schinazi-quic-h3-datagram-05.txt</link>
    <description>The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging the security and congestion-control properties of QUIC.  However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex application contexts.  This document defines how to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is HTTP/3 by adding an identifier at the start of the frame payload.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list (quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org)) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft-h3-datagram.</description>
