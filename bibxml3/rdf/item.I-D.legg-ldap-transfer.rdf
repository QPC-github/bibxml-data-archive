    <title>"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Transfer Encoding Options", Steven Legg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-legg-ldap-transfer-06.txt</link>
    <description>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type).  A syntax definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax are normally represented when transferred in LDAP operations.  This representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This document introduces a new category of attribute options, called transfer encoding options, that can be used to specify that the associated attribute values are encoded according to one of these other methods.</description>
