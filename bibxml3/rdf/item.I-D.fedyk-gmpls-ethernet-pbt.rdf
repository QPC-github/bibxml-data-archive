    <description>Carrier Grade Ethernet transport solutions require the capability of flexible service provisioning and fast protection switching. Currently, Ethernet is being extended in IEEE to meet the scalability needs of transport networks. The IETF specified GMPLS to control transport networks. To enable integration of Ethernet based transport solutions the extension of GMPLS control plane for Ethernet is of value. This memo describes how a GMPLS control plane may be applied to Provider Backbone Transport (PBT) and how GMPLS can be used to configure VLAN-aware Ethernet switches in order to establish Ethernet P2P and P2MP MAC switched paths and P2P/P2MP VID based trees. This document assumes any standard changes to IEEE data planes will be undertaken only in the IEEE.</description>
