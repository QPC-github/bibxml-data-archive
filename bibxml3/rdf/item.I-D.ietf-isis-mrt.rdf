    <title>"Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT)", Zhenbin Li, Nan Wu, Quintin Zhao, Alia Atlas, Chris Bowers, Jeff Tantsura</title>

    <description>This document describes extensions to IS-IS to support the distributed computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT).  Example uses of MRT include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global protection or live-live for multicast traffic.  The extensions indicate what MRT profile(s) each router supports.  Different MRT profiles can be defined to support different uses and to allow transition of capabilities.  An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible links, due to administrative policy.  This document also defines the Controlled Convergence sub-TLV, which is useful for MRT FRR as well as other applications.</description>
