    <title>"Requirements and Framework for Unified MPLS Sub-Network Interconnection", David Allan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-allan-unified-mpls-ic-req-frmwk-00.txt</link>
    <description>The definition of a transport profile for MPLS means that MPLS network architectures will emerge that combines both managed and control plane driven MPLS sub-networks and requires interconnection of same to achieve a unified MPLS architecture.  This document generalizes the problem of sub-network interconnect, discusses issues in general and suggests ways forward.</description>
