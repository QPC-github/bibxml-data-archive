    <description>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource- constrained nodes and networks such as sensor nodes in a low-power lossy network (LLN).  Yet to implement this Internet protocol on Class 1 devices (as per RFC 7228, ~ 10 KiB of RAM and ~ 100 KiB of ROM) also lightweight implementation techniques are necessary.  This document provides lessons learned from implementing CoAP for tiny, battery-operated networked embedded systems.  In particular, it provides guidance on correct implementation of the CoAP specification RFC 7252, memory optimizations, and customized protocol parameters.</description>
