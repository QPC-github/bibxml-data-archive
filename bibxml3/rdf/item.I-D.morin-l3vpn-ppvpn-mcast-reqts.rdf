    <title>"Requirements for multicast in Provider Provisioned IP VPNs", Thomas Morin, Renaud Moignard, Jean-Louis Le Roux</title>

    <description>This document presents a set of functional requirements for network solutions that allow the support of IP multicast within IP provider provided virtual private networks (PP VPNs). It specifies requirements both from the end user and service provider standpoints. It is intended that potential solutions, that specify the support of IP multicast within VPNs, use these requirements as a guideline. It is not the intent of this document to propose technical solutions, nor to detail solution specific issues.</description>
