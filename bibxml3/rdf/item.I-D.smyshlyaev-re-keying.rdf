    <description>This specification presents an approach to increase the security of block cipher operation modes based on re-keying (with no additional keys needed) during each separate message processing.  It provides an internal re-keying mechanism called ACPKM.  This mechanism doesn't require additional secret parameters or complicated transforms - for key update only the base encryption function is used.</description>
