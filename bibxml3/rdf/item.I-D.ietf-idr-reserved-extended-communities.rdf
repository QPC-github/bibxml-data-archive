    <title>"Assigned BGP extended communities", Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idr-reserved-extended-communities-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an IANA registry in order to assign non- transitive extended communities from.  These are similar to the existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide a control over inter-AS community advertisement as, per RFC RFC 4360, they are not transitive across Autonomous System boundaries.  For that purpose, this document defines the use of the reserved Autonomous System number 0.65535 in the non-transitive generic four- octet AS specific extended community type.</description>
