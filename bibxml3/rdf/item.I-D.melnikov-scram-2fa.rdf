        <description>This specification describes an extension to family of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL; RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides support for 2 factor authentication.  This specification also gives an example of how TOTP (RFC 6238) can be used as the second factor.</description>
