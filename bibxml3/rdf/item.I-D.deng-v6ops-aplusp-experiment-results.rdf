    <description>This memo describes an implementation of A+P in a provider's IPv6- only network. It provides details of the implementation, network elements, configurations and test results as well. Besides traditional port range A+P, a scattered port sets flavour of A+P is also implemented and verified for the sake of distributing incoming ports among customers in a more discrete way. The test results consist of the application compatibility test, UPnP extension for A+P, port usage and BitTorrent behaviour with A+P.  This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P.</description>
