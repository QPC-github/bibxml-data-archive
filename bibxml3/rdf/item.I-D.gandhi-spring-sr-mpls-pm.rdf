    <description>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks using probe messages.  This document reviews how these mechanisms can be used for Delay and Loss Performance Measurements (PM) in Segment Routing (SR) networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR links and end-to-end SR Policies.  The performance measurements for SR links are used to compute extended Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics for delay and loss and are advertised in the network using routing protocol extensions.</description>
