    <description>The increasing popularity of IS-IS [IS-IS] and OSPF [OSPF] over the years has drawn significant attention to the relative merits and de-merits of one with respect to the other. This draft presents an elaborate comparison between the two routing protocols to explain how the features and functionalities of one differs from the other. Wherever applicable the differences between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3[OSPFv3] have also been pointed out.</description>
