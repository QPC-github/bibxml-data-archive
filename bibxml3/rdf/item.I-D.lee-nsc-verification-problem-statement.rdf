    <description>This document addresses the possible conflicts between service overlays in the network service chaining.  These conflicts are due to overlapping in classification rules and resource sharing of service overlays.  The verification of service chains provides a method for network administrators to detect such conflicts and correct a problematic service chain before applying it on the real network.</description>
