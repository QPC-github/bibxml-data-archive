    <title>"Preventing Fragmentation for Client Initiated Connections in the Session  Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Marc Petit-Huguenin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-draft-petithuguenin-sip-outbound-fragmentation-00.txt</link>
    <description>There is cases where a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client can initiate a bidirectional UDP stream or a congestion controlled protocol connection to a SIP server but the SIP server cannot do the same in the other direction. The server can reuse the existing bidirectional UDP stream or connection but cannot use a congestion controlled protocol connection if the client chose to use a bidirectional UDP stream. This document described a method to force the client to initiate a congestion controlled protocol connection to the server.</description>
