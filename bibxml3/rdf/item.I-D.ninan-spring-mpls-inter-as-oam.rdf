    <description>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  Segment Routing also provides an easy and efficient way to provide inter connectivity in a large scale network as described in [RFC8604].  [RFC8287] illustrates the problem and defines extensions to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifiers (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane.  It is useful to have the LSP Ping and traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path spans across multiple ASes.  This document describes mechanisms to facilitae LSP ping and traceroute in inter-AS SR networks in an efficient manner with simple OAM protocol extension which uses dataplane forwarding alone for sending Echo-Reply.</description>
