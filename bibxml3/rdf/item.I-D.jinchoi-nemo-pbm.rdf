    <title>"Prefix binding based mobility management in WiMAX network", JinHyeock Choi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jinchoi-nemo-pbm-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a protocol which provides movbility support for an ordinary IPv6 host in WiMAX network. The protocol allows session continuity for every IPv6 node in WiMAX network as it moves across subnets. The protocol exploits the facts that a single prefix is assigned per an IPv6 host in WiMAX network and prefix binding scheme is defined in NEMO WG. WiMAX access routers perform prefix binding for the hosts' stead and the mobility is transparent to the hosts inside WiMAX network.</description>
