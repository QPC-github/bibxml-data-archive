    <title>"Recommendation for Not Using AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET in BGP", Warren Kumari, Kotikalapudi Sriram</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-sets-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document recommends against the use of the AS_SET and AS_CONFED_SET types of the AS_PATH in BGPv4.  This is done to simplify the design and implementation of the BGP protocol and to make the semantics of the originator of a route more clear.  This will also simplify the design, implementation and deployment of ongoing work in the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group.</description>
