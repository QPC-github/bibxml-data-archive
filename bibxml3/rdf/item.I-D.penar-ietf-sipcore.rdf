    <title>"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Response Code for Call Rating", Russ Penar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-penar-ietf-sipcore-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the 184 (Rated) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) response code. This response code enables calling parties to learn an intermediary rated their call attempt.  Depending on rating (e.g. Likely Scam), the call may be rejected or go unanswered. Through a 1xx code, the caller?s network may become aware future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely go unanswered. The initial use case driving the need for a 184 response code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine. In this case, the rating is constructed via machine or other process. This contrasts with 607 (Unwanted) &amp; 608 (Rejected) SIP response codes in which a human at target User Agent Server, or terminating network analytics,indicate the call may not completed.  This document also defines use of a Call-Info header field in 184 responses to enable negatively rated callers to contact entities that rated their calls in error. This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers who find their calls going unanswered (not necessarily blocked).</description>
