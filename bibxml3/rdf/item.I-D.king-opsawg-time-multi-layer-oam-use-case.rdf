    <description>This document identifies and discusses use-cases and high level requirements for transport technology independent OAM that need to interface multi-layer or multi-domain transport networks to cover heterogeneous networking technologies.  As providers face multi-layer networks and diverse transport technologies, generic and integrated OAM is desirable for simplifying network operations and maintenance.</description>
