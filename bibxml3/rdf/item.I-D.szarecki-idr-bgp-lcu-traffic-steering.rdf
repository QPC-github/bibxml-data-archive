    <title>"Inter-Domain Traffic Steering with BGP Labeled Colored Unicast (BGP-LCU)", Louis Chan, Rafal Szarecki</title>

    <description>This document describes technology that enables for Inter-Domain signaling of existence of E2E path that satisfy high-level traffic treatment behavior intent.  The inter-domain path is built by the BGP protocol, as a concatenation of per TE-domain internal paths (segments), provisioned by one of existing intra-domain techniques. The traffic treatment behavior is encoded as an integer value called as "COLOR".  The domain internal paths/tunnels are marked as satisfying given traffic treatment behavior.  Then the tunnel destination and its COLOR are exchanged between TE-Domains using a new BGP LABELED-COLORED-UNICAST NLRI (BGP-LCU) defined in this document.</description>
