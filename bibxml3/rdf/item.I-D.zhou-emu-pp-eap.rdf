    <description>This document defines the Protected Password-based Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method. PP-EAP is an EAP method that enables secure exchange of password authentication mechanisms between a peer and an EAP server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a server-authenticated TLS tunnel. Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey password-based authentication between the peer and the EAP server.</description>
