    <title>"Geodetic-Civic Address Translation Protocol", Robins George, Qian Sun, Carl Reed</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-george-geopriv-address-translation-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document explains how to map a geodetic datum to a civic address and vice versa.  Server accepts an HTTP POST with one form of user specified location addresses and return whatever other form it has.  [Open Issue : re-frame this draft as more about the inclusion of a &lt;presence> element in a HELD request, rather than about geocoding specifically, since there are other applications.  E.g., we might provide a rough location in our request to help the server provide us with GPS assistance data.]</description>
