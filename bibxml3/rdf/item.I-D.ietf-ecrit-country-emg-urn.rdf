    <description>Section 4.2 of RFC 5031 allows the registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type only for emergency services "that are offered widely and in different countries".  This document updates those instructions in RFC 5031 to allow such registrations when, at the time of registration, those services are offered in one country only.</description>
