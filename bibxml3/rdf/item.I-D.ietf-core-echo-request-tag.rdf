        <description>This document specifies enhancements to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that mitigate security issues in particular use cases.  The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its claimed network address.  The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server to match block-wise message fragments belonging to the same request.  This document updates RFC 7252 with respect to the client Token processing requirements, forbidding non-secure reuse of Tokens to ensure binding of response to request when CoAP is used with a security protocol, and with respect to amplification mitigation, where the use of Echo is now recommended.</description>
