    <description>For an virtualized overlay network, there are many encapsulations that may be used.  Different customer have their own preference.  So if some of these different encapsulation can be interconnected together, the virtualized overlay network would be more compatible and have loose strict on access.  This document is going to provide an architecture of different overlay encapsulation interconnection and an tranformer gateway for these end station connected to the virtual network.</description>
