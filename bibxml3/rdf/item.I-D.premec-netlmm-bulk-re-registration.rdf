    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification requires the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to send a separate Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) for each mobile node (MN) to renew the MN's mobility binding.  This document defines a mechanism by which a MAG can update the mobility bindings of multiple MNs attached to it with a single PBU message to the serving LMA.  This document also specifies a new mobility option that can be used by the mobility entities in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for carrying the group affiliation of a mobile node in any of the mobility signaling messages.</description>
