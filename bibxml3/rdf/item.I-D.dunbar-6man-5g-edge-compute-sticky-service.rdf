        <description>This draft describes the IPv6-based solutions that can stick an application flow originated from a mobile device to the same ANYCAST server location when the mobile device moves from one 5G cell site to another.  The proposed solution expands the Application-aware ID and Service-Para options specified by [APN6] by including the ANYCAST Sticky Service location information in the IPv6 Hop-by- Hop or Destination Optional Header.</description>
