    <title>"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) A Control  Channel for Pseudowires", Thomas Nadeau, Carlos Pignataro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-15.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes Virtual Circuit Connection Verification (VCCV) which provides a control channel that is associated with a Pseudowire (PW), as well as the corresponding operations and management functions such as connectivity verification to be used over that control channel. VCCV applies to all supported access circuit and transport types currently defined for PWs.</description>
