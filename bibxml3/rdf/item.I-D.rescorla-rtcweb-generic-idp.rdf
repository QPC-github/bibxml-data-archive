    <description>Security for RTCWEB communications requires that the communicating endpoints be able to authenticate each other.  While authentication may be mediated by the calling service, there are settings in which this is undesirable.  This document describes a generic mechanism for leveraging existing identity providers (IdPs) such as BrowserID or OAuth to provide this authentication service.</description>
