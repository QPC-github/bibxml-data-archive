    <description>Users that need to connect to their enterprise network from an untrusted network require secure connectivity and mobility. Enterprise users are increasingly using mobile nodes.  A user may need to connect to the enterprise network from anywhere, and in a number of scenarios, from untrusted networks.  There are existing specifications developed by the Mobile IPv4 working group that describe solutions for enterprise secure connectivity and mobility. This document proposes optimizations to those solutions to reduce the tunneling overhead and allow for a number of new access modes.</description>
