        <description>Raw binary data is often encoded using a mechanism that enables the data to be included in human-readable text-based formats.  This mechanism is often referred to as "base-encoding the data".  Base- encoding is often used when expressing binary data in hyperlinks, cryptographic keys in web pages, or security tokens in application software.  There are a variety of base-encodings, such as base32, base58, and base64.  It is not always possible to differentiate one base-encoding from another.  The purpose of this specification is to provide a mechanism to be able to deterministically identify the base-encoding for a particular string of data.</description>
