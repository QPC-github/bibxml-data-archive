    <title>"Multicast Control Extensions for ANCP", Francois Le Faucheur, Roberta Maglione, Tom Taylor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ancp-mc-extensions-16.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the extensions to the Access Node Control Protocol required for support of the multicast use cases defined in the Access Node Control Protocol framework document and one additional use case described in this document.  These use cases are organized into the following ANCP capabilities:  o  NAS-initiated multicast replication;  o  conditional access and admission control with white and black lists;  o  conditional access and admission control with grey lists;  o  bandwidth delegation;  o  committed bandwidth reporting.  These capabilities may be combined according to the rules given in this specification.  This document updates RFC 6320 by assigning capability type 3 to a capability specified in this document and by changing the starting point for IANA allocation of result codes determined by IETF Consensus from 0x100 to 0x64.</description>
