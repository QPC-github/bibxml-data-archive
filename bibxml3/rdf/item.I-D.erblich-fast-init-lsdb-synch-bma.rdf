    <title>"Fast Initial OSPFv2 LSDB Synchronization for BMA", Mitchell Erblich</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-erblich-fast-init-lsdb-synch-bma-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo documents a feature that significantly decreases the initial LSDB synchronization time in Broadcast Multiple Access (BMA) environments. This implementation only requires a single OSPF speaker per psuedo-node to support this functionality. These changes are implicitly supported within the OSPFv2 protocol. This memo is not intended to serve as a model for any other implementation.</description>
