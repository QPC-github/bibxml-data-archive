    <description>As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid and dynamic control increases.  With scale, the need to automate even the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as policy-based controls.  In order to enable applications to have access to and control over information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publically documented interface specification.  The interface needs to support real-time, transaction-based interactions using efficient data models and encodings.  Furthermore, the interface must support a variety of use cases including those where verified control feed-back loops are needed.  This document expands upon these statements of requirements to provide a problem statement for an interface to the Internet routing system.</description>
