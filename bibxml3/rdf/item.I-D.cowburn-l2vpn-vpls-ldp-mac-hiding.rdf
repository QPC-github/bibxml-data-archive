    <title>"MAC Hiding in an H-VPLS Environment", Ian Cowburn</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cowburn-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-hiding-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism for hiding customer MAC addresses on a PE-rs in an H-VPLS environment. In the H-VPLS hierarchy, a PE-rs is exposed to the MAC addresses for customers on its directly attached MTU-s and the remote MAC addresses for all of its configured VPLS instances. This can result in the requirement to store a large number of a MAC addresses. This document introduces the concept of an MTU-id per MTU-s which is included with the customer frame sent by an MTU-s. The PE-rs is then able to switch based on the MTU-id rather than the customer MAC addresses, thereby reducing the address storage requirements on the PE-rs to be of the order of the number of MTU-s.</description>
