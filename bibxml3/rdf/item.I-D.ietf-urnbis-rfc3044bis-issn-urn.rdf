    <title>"Using International Standard Serial Numbers as Uniform Resource Names", Pierre Godefroy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3044bis-issn-urn-01.txt</link>
    <description>The International Standard Serial Number, ISSN, has been the authoritative identifier for continuing resources (which include serials) for more than three decades.  Since 2001, the URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace "ISSN" has been reserved for ISSNs.  The namespace registration was performed in RFC 3044.  This document redefines -- in a backwards compatible manner -- how the revised ISSN standard can be supported within the URN framework, taking into account in particular the latest revision of the ISSN standard in the ISO framework (ISO 3297:2007).  Moreover, additional syntax related information required by the RFC 2141[bis] has been included.  An updated namespace registration is provided.  This document replaces RFC 3044.</description>
