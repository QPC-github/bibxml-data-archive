    <description>This document defines two PIM Join/Prune attributes that support the construction of multicast distribution trees where the root and receivers are located in different LISP sites.  These attributes allow the receiver site to select between unicast and multicast transport and to convey the receiver RLOC address to the control plane of the root xTR.</description>
