    <title>"Header Compression over Unidirectional Lightweight Encryption (ULE)", Do  Byun</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-byun-ipdvb-ule-header-comp-01.txt</link>
    <description>Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) is widely deployed in DVB-S and DVB-S2 networks [DVB-S2]. Replacing MPE with Unidirectional Lightweight Encryption (ULE) has been proposed to gain flexibility and reduce overhead. This paper introduces a signaling method for sending header-compressed unicast packets over satellite networks using ULE, taking advantage of ULE's increased flexibility.</description>
