        <description>The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure uses references to keys in general.  For some algorithms, additional properties are defined which carry parameters relating to keys as needed.  The COSE Key structure is used for transporting keys outside of COSE messages.  This document extends the way that keys can be identified and transported by providing attributes that refer to or contain X.509 certificates.</description>
