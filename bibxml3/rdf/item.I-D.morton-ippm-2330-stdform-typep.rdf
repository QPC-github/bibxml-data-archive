    <title>"IP Options and IPv6 Updates for IPPM's Active Metric Framework: Packets of Type-P and Standard-Formed Packets", Al Morton, Joachim Fabini, Nalini Elkins, mackermann@bcbsm.com, Vinayak Hegde</title>

    <description>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing. The memo updates the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC 2330 to include IPv6 packets.  It also augments distinguishing aspects of packets, referred to as Type-P for test packets in RFC 2330.  Two points (at least) are worthwhile discussing further: extent of coverage for 6LO and IPv6 Header Compression, and the continued need to define a "minimal standard-formed packet".</description>
