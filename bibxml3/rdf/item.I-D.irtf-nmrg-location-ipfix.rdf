    <description>IP Flow-based monitoring lacks a mechanism to associate measured IP Flow information with the geographic location of the device where the IP Flows have been observed. This document defines a set of guidelines and best practices to extend IP Flow monitoring protocols with location information of the device (both fixed and mobile) that acts as an IP Flow metering process.</description>
