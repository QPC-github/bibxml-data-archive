    <description>Commonly used networking APIs are currently limited by the transport layer's inability to expose services instead of protocols.  An API/ application/user is therefore forced to use exactly the services that are implemented by the selected transport.  This document surveys networking APIs and discusses how they can be improved by a more expressive transport layer that hides and automatizes the choice of the transport protocol.</description>
