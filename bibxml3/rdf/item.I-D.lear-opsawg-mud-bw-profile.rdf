    <description>Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and how the network should treat them.  Earlier work focused on access control.  This draft specifies a means by which manufacturers can express to deployments what form of bandwidth profile devices are expected to have with respect to specific services.</description>
