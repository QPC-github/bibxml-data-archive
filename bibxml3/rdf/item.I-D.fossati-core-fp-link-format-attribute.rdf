    <title>"Resource Discovery through Proxies", Thomas Fossati, Salvatore Loreto</title>

    <description>The aim of this draft is to open a discussion on how to make it possible to advertise the fact that a given resource hosted by a server can only be reached through a specific CoAP Proxy.  This memo proposes the definition of the "fp" (forward proxy) CoAP link format attribute, that can be used to inform CoAP endpoints that a given resource can be reached by passing through the advertising Proxy.</description>
