    <description>This document describes the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Handover Protocol (CAPWAPHP) which is a protocol allowing the access controller of CAPWAP Working Group architecture to anchor and manage 802.11 handovers of the stations between a collection of Wireless Termination Points (access points). The protocol, like IEEE's IAPP aims to ensure that a station is connected to a single access point and provides an efficient context transfer mechanism during handover using neighbor graphs. CAPWAPHP handles local MAC and Split MAC with separate procedures. CAPWAPHP can be transported using CAPWAP protocol.</description>
