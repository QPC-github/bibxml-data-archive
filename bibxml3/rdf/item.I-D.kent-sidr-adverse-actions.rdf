    <title>"Adverse Actions by a Certification Authority (CA) or Repository Manager in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)", Stephen Kent, Di Ma</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kent-sidr-adverse-actions-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent repository manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet Number Resources (INRs) associated with that CA or its subordinate CAs.  The analysis is based on examination of the data items in the RPKI repository, as controlled by a CA (or independent repository manager) and fetched by Relying Parties (RPs).  The analysis is performed from the perspective of an affected INR holder.  The analysis does not purport to be comprehensive; it does represent an orderly way to analyze a number of ways that errors by or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI and routing decisions based on RPKI data.</description>
