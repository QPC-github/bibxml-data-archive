    <title>"NFS Version 4.1 Update for Multi-Server Namespace", David Noveck, Chuck Lever</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-nfsv4-rfc5661-msns-update-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections concerning features related to the use of attributes in NFSv4.1 related to file system location.  These revised features include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to another, and include facilities to support trunking by allowing discovery of the set of network addresses to use to access a file system.  This document updates RFC5661.</description>
