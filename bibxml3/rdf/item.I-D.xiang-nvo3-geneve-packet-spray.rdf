    <description>Congestion is the killer of low latency and high throughput.Network congestion occurs on the interconnection links of a data center due to poor traffic distribution. Load balancing technologies are used to solve network congestion. Packet spraying is a kind of load balancing technology with finer granularity. This document describes a packet spraying protocol in the Geneve encapsulation network[1] using a newly defined Geneve Option field.</description>
