    <title>"Origin Validation Signaling", Randy Bush, Keyur Patel</title>

    <description>Within a trust boundary, e.g. an operator's PoP, it may be useful to have only a few central devices do full Origin Validation using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure, and be able to signal to an internal sender that a received route fails Origin Validation.  E.g. route reflectors could perform Origin Validation for a cluster and signal back to a sending client that it sent an invalid route. Routers capable of sending and receiving this signal can use the extended community described in [RFC8097].</description>
