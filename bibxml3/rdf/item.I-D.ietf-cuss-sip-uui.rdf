    <title>"A Mechanism for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in SIP", Alan Johnston, James Rafferty</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-17.txt</link>
    <description>There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The syntax and semantics for the UUI data used by a specific application are defined by a UUI package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an extension mechanism.</description>
