    <title>"Concepts and Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP", David Bryan, Philip Matthews, Eunsoo Shim, Dean Willis, Spencer Dawkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-p2psip-concepts-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines concepts and terminology for the use of the Session Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar and message routing functions are replaced by a distributed mechanism.  These mechanisms may be implemented using a distributed hash table or other distributed data mechanism with similar external properties.  This document includes a high-level view of the functional relationships between the network elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations, and an outline of the related problems addressed by the P2PSIP working group and the RELOAD protocol and SIP usage document defined by the working group.</description>
