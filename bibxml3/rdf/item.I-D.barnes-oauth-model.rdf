    <title>"The OAuth Security Model for Delegated Authorization", Richard Barnes, Matt Lepinski</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-oauth-model-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the security model for the OAuth authorization system, which allows a party that holds some authorization to delegate a subset of that authorization to another party, without requiring either party to disclose its credentials to the other.  In this document, we describe a set of design constraints, a high-level work flow for establishing authorizations subject to those constraints, and set of security requirements for protocols that implement this model.</description>
