    <title>"Requirements on I-D Tracker Extensions for IAB and IRTF Document Shepherds", Henrik Levkowetz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-proto-iab-irtf-tracker-ext-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the states which need to be added to the I-D tracker to make it possible for IAB and IRTF document shepherds (whoever the IAB and IRTF designate, e.g. the IAB Chair, RG Chairs) to update the I-D tracker during document shepherding. It is a companion document of draft-proto-wgchair-tracker-ext which describes additional requirements for the chairs to use the I-D tracker for managing WG documents from their earliest stages.</description>
