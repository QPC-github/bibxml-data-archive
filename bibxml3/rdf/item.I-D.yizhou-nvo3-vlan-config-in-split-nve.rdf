    <description>In a Split-NVE structure, a control plane protocol between a hypervisor and its associated external NVE(s) to distribute the virtual machine networking state and the relevant attributes. One of the key attributes to be negotiated is VLAN ID which is the most common locally-significant tag for carrying traffic associated with a specific virtual network. This document provides the informational guides on how to configure the VLAN IDs to local networks in Split- NVE structure.</description>
