    <title>"Route Optimization with Nested Correspondent Nodes", Thierry Ernst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-watari-nemo-nested-cn-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document aims at assisting the problem statement of route optimization in nested mobile networks. We describe the paths packets would take using existing Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Basic Support mechanisms when one or both end nodes of a communication flow are located in a nested NEMO. One of both of the end nodes may themselves be either mobile nodes performing Mobile IPv6, or standard IPv6 nodes performing no mobility function at all. The path can become extremely suboptimal if no optimization is provided.</description>
