    <description>The Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group (MC-LAG) technology enables the establishment of a logical link-aggregation connection with a redundant group of independent nodes. The purpose of multi-chassis LAG is to provide a solution to achieve higher network availability, while providing different modes of sharing/balancing of traffic. EVPN standard defines EVPN based MC-LAG with single-active and all-active multi-homing load-balancing mode. The current draft expands on existing redundancy mechanisms supported by EVPN and introduces support of port-active load-balancing mode. In the current document, port-active load-balancing mode is also referred to as per interface active/standby.</description>
