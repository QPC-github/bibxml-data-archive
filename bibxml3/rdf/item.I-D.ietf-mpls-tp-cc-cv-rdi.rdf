    <description>Continuity Check, Proactive Connectivity Verification and Remote Defect Indication functionalities are required for MPLS-TP OAM.  Continuity Check monitors a label switched path for any loss-of- continuity defect. Connectivity Verification augments Continuity Check in order to provide confirmation that the desired source is connected to the desired sink. Remote defect indication enables an End Point to report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on a pseudo wire, label switched path or Section.  This document specifies specific extensions to BFD and methods for proactive Continuity Check, Continuity Verification, and Remote Defect Indication for MPLS-TP label switched paths, pseudo wires and Sections using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection as extended by this memo.</description>
