        <description>This document specifies the use of identity as a raw public key in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  The TLS protocol procedures are kept unchanged, but signature algorithms are extended to support Identity-based signature (IBS).  A few Identity-based signature algorithms from different standard organizations are supported in the current version.</description>
