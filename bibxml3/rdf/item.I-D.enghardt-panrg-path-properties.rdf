    <description>Path properties express information about paths across a network and the services provided via such paths.  In a path-aware network, path properties may be fully or partially available to entities such as hosts.  This document defines and categorizes path properties. Furthermore, the document specifies several path properties which might be useful to hosts or other entities.</description>
