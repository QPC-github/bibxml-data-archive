    <description>With BGP/MPLS VPNs, providing any-to-any connectivity among sites of a given Virtual Private Network would require each Provider Edge router that has one or more of these sites connected to it to hold all the routes of that Virtual Private Network. The approach described in this document allows the VPN service provider to reduce the number of Provider Edge routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring only a subset of these routers to maintain all these routes.  Furthermore, when Provider Edge routers use ingress replication to carry multicast traffic of VPN customers, the approach described in this document may under certain circumstances allow to reduce bandwidth inefficiency associated with ingress replication, and to redistribute the replication load among Provider Edge routers.</description>
