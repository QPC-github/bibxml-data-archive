    <title>"Re-INVITE and Target-refresh Request Handling in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Gonzalo Camarillo, Christer Holmberg, Gao yang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipcore-reinvite-08.txt</link>
    <description>The procedures for handling SIP re-INVITEs are described in RFC 3261. Implementation and deployment experience has uncovered a number of issues with the original documentation, and this document provides additional procedures that update the original specification to address those issues.  In particular, this document defines in which situations a UAS (User Agent Server) should generate a success response and in which situations a UAS should generate an error response to a re-INVITE.  Additionally, this document defines further details of procedures related to target-refresh requests.</description>
