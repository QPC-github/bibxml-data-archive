        <title>"DTLS Tunnel between a Media Distributor and Key Distributor to Facilitate Key Exchange", Paul Jones, Paul Ellenbogen, Nils Ohlmeier</title>
        <dc:date>2021-11-12T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines a protocol for tunneling DTLS traffic in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Distributor.  The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the Media Distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the Media Distributor.</description>
