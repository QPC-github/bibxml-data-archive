    <title>"Advertising a Router's Local Addresses in OSPF TE Extensions", Rahul Aggarwal, Kireeti Kompella</title>

    <description>OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions are used to advertise TE Link State Advertisements (LSAs) containing information about TE- enabled links. The only addresses belonging to a router that are advertised in TE LSAs are the local addresses corresponding to TE- enabled links, and the local address corresponding to the Router ID.  In order to allow other routers in a network to compute Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to a given router's local addresses, those addresses must also be advertised by OSPF TE.  This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise a router's local addresses.</description>
