    <description>The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4 and IPv6 co-exist brings a number of extra security considerations that need to be taken into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the dual-protocol network and the associated transition mechanisms. This document attempts to give an overview of the various issues grouped into three categories: Issues due to the IPv6 protocol itself, due to transition mechanisms, and due to the way in which IPv6 is being deployed.</description>
