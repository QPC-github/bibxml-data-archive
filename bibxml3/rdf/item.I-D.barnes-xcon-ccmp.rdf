    <description>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) defined in this document provides the mechanisms to create, change and delete objects related to centralized conferences, including participants, their media and their roles.  The protocol relies on web services and SIP event notification as its infrastructure, but can control conferences that use any signaling protocol to invite users.  CCMP is based on the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), with the data necessary for the interactions specified via Web Services Description Language (WSDL).</description>
