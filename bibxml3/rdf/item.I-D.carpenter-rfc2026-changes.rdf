    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-carpenter-rfc2026-changes-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a number of changes to RFC 2026, the basic definition of the IETF standards process.  While some of them are definite changes to the rules, the intention is to preserve the main intent of the original rules, while adapting them to experience and current practice.</description>
