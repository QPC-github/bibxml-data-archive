    <description>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.  STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.  This is an important change from the previous version of this specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution.  This document obsoletes RFC 3489.</description>
