    <title>"Energy Monitoring and Management of Networked Entities using SNMP and Role-Specific Sparse Tables", Chris Verges</title>

    <description>This document defines a subset of the Management Information Base (MIB) for power and energy monitoring of devices.  The module addresses devices identification, context information, and the relationship between reporting devices, remote devices, and monitoring probes.  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines objects for managing the power usage of a network entity.  The energy management schema is split into one core table to enumerate the entities being managed and numerous sparse table extensions that add role-specific functionality where appropriate.</description>
