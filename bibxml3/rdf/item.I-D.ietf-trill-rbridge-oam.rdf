    <title>"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Support", David Bond, Vishwas Manral</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-trill-rbridge-oam-02.txt</link>
    <description>Routing Bridges (RBridges) implement the TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol which provide a transparent least- cost frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, while also inherently providing loop mitigation.  As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise.  This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) purposes in RBridge campuses.  The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</description>
