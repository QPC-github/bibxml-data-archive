    <description>This document describes ring based VPLS architecture. This architecture is an alternative to existing VPLS architecture. It can simplify full mesh connections and provide a standard based protection mechanism, especially when underlying infrastructure is ring based. It can also reduce unnecessary customer multicast traffic compared with existing full mesh based VPLS.</description>
