    <title>"Framework for Transcoding with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Gonzalo Camarillo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-transc-framework-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP.  This framework includes how to discover the need for transcoding services in a session and how to invoke those transcoding services.  Two models for transcoding services invocation are discussed: the conference bridge model and the third party call control model.  Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-impaired individuals.</description>
