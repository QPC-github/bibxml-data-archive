        <description>The Layer-3 Discovery and Liveness protocol OPEN PDU may contain a public key and a certificate, which can be used to verify signatures on subsequent PDUs.  This document describes two mechanisms based on digital signatures, one that is Trust On First Use (TOFU), and one that uses a trust anchor signture over the public key to provide authentication as well as session integrity.</description>
