    <description>Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming with rapid increase of various wearable devices, vehicle embedded devices and so on, and providing the effective mobility management for these IoT devices becomes a challenge due to the different application scenarios as well as the limited energy and bandwidth. Many researchers have focused on this topic and proposed several solutions based on the combination of IoT features and traditional mobility management protocols, in which most of these schemes take the IoT devices as mobile networks and adopt the NEtwork MObility (NEMO) and its variants to provide the mobility support. However, these solutions are in face of the heavy signaling cost problem. Considering that IoT devices generally collaborate to realize the complex functions, these devices may have the similar movement behaviors. This document therefore specifies a PMIPv6-based group binding update method to reduce the singling cost and improve the scalability for these devices.</description>
