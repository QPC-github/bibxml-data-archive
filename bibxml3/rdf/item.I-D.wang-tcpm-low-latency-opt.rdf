    <description>This document specifies the TCP Low Latency option, which TCP connections can use during the connection establishment handshake to communicate extra parameters that can improve performance in low- latency environments.  With the first such parameter, a TCP data receiver can advertise a hint about the Maximum ACK Delay (MAD) it will schedule for its own delayed ACK mechanism.  This enables the TCP data sender to achieve lower latencies during loss recovery by using the Maximum ACK Delay advertised by the remote receiver to help compute retransmission timeouts that are potentially much lower than would otherwise be feasible.  The Low Latency option is extensible, and later versions of this draft will introduce other mechanisms, including TCP timestamps with a finer granularity than those supported by RFC 7323.</description>
