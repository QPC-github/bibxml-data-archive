    <title>"Clarifying when Standards Track Documents may Refer Normatively to Documents at a Lower Level", Murray Kucherawy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kucherawy-rfc3967bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from other standards bodies).  For example, a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC.  Exceptions to this rule are sometimes needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards.  This document clarifies and updates the procedure used in these circumstances.</description>
