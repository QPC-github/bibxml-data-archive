    <description>This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, restrictions and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission protocols. This profile allows clients (especially those that are constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit mail. This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to download and upload the mail, to optimize submission and to efficiently resynchronize in case of loss of connectivity with the server. The Lemonade profile relies upon extensions to IMAP and Mail Submission protocols; specifically URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol [RFC3501] extensions and BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol [SUBMIT].</description>
