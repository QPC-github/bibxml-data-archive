    <description>The purpose of this paper is to describe an AAA protocol designed for NEMO services. The proposed AAA protocol retains the NEMO mobility transparency in the NEMO basic support protocol, while providing all the required AAA functionalities for mobile network nodes. In addition, the proposed AAA protocol reduces authentication latency by localizing AAA process.</description>
