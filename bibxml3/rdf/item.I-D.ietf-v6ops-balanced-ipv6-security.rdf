    <title>"Balanced Security for IPv6 Residential CPE", Martin Gysi, Guillaume Leclanche, Eric Vyncke, Ragnar Anfinsen</title>

    <description>This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a mostly end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats outside of the home.  It is documenting an existing IPv6 deployment by Swisscom and allows all packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as weak passwords) are well-known.  The policy is a proposed set of rules that can be used as a default setting.  The set of blocked inbound and outbound ports is expected to be updated as threats come and go.</description>
