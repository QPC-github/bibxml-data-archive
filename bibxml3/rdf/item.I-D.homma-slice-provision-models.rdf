    <description>Network slicing is an approach to provide separate virtual network based on service requirements, and it's a key feature of the 5G. 3GPP has standardized the specifications for network slicing in the 5GS, but there are still some problems for realization of end-to-end network slices.  For complementing the lacks or expanding the usability, several organizations are proceeding standardization. However, the definitions and scopes of network slicing vary to some degree from one organization to another.  This document provides classification of provisioning models of network slice for clarifying the differences on the definitions and scopes.</description>
