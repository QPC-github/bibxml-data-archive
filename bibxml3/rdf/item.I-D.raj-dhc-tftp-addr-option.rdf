    <description>This memo documents existing usage for the "TFTP Server Address Option".  The option number currently in use is 150.  This memo documents the current usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942 [RFC3942], which declares that any pre-existing usages of option numbers in the range 128 - 223 should be documented and the working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those options. The option is defined for DHCPv4 and works only with IPv4 addresses.</description>
