    <description>IP mutli-function Media Server control is a problem that has slowly bubbled up in importance over the past four years. A driver in the IETF is the requirements generated by the XCON framework. Many approaches have been proposed. Some of these proposals are device- controlled-oriented, such as H.248. Others are server-oriented, using SIP and application-oriented markup. Before rushing headlong into a framework for a solution, it is time to step back and try to understand just what the scope of the problem is. Once consensus is reached, we can then move forward with a framework for a solution. This document describes a number of existing approaches and proposals to solve the Application Server - Media Server protocol problem, their characteristics and benefits and drawbacks.</description>
