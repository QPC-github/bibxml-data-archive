    <description>Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent to be secured.  However security for the user plane/traffic is optional and is a choice left to the mobile node.  This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which enables the user plane traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis.  The mobile node or the home agent can request at any time security for the user plane traffic.  Security for user plane traffic can be triggered as a result of policy or, mobility or, at the user's choice.</description>
