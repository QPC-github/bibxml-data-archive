    <description>Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an IPv4 over IPv6 hub and spoke mechanism that provides overlay IPv4 services in an IPv6-only access network.  Provisioning IPv4 addresses and port set to customers is the core function of Lightweight 4over6 control plane.  [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] illustrates how to use DHCPv6 for deterministic IPv4 provisioning.  This document discusses how to provision IPv4 parameters by using dynamic IPv4 provisioning protocols such as DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341].  This document describes a dynamic IPv4 provisioning mode for Lightweight 4over6 that uses DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] for IPv4 address provisioning.</description>
