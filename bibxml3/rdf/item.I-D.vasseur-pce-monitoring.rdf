    <title>"A set of monitoring tools for Path Computation Element based Architecture", JP Vasseur</title>

    <description>A Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture has been specified for the computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks in the context of single or multiple domains (where a domain is referred to as a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems). In PCE-based environments it is thus critical to monitor the state of the path computation chain for troubleshooting and performance monitoring purposes: liveness of each element (PCE) involved in the PCE chain, detection of potential resource contention states, statistics in term of path computation times are examples of such metrics of interest. This document specifies procedures and extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to gather such information.</description>
