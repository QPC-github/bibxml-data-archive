        <description>As network scale increases and network operation becomes more sophisticated, existing Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) methods are no longer sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements.  Emerging data-plane on-path telemetry techniques which provide high-precision flow insight and which issue notifications in real time can supplement existing proactive and reactive methods that run in active and passive modes.  These new approaches are collectively known as in-situ flow information telemetry (IFIT).  They enable quality of experience for users and applications, and identification of network faults and deficiencies.  This document outlines a high-level framework for IFIT to collect and correlate performance measurement information from the network.  It identifies the components that coordinate existing protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses deployment challenges for flow- oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks.  The document is a guide for system designers applying the referenced techniques.  It is also intended to motivate further work to enhance the OAM ecosystem.</description>
