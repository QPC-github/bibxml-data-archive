    <title>"Eliding and Querying RPL Information", Pascal Thubert, Rahul Jadhav, Li Zhao, Dominique Barthel</title>

    <description>This document presents a method to safely elide a group of RPL options in a DIO message by synchronizing the state associated with each of these options between parent and child using a new sequence counter in DIO messages.  A child that missed a DIO message with an update of any of those protected options detects it by the change of sequence counter and queries the update with a DIS Message.  The draft also provides a method to fully elide the options in a DAO message.</description>
