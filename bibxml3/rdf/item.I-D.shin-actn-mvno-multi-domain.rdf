    <title>"ACTN Use-case for Mobile Virtual Network Operation for Multiple Domains in a Single Operator Network", Jongyoon Shin, Rod Hwang, Jongmin Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shin-actn-mvno-multi-domain-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for virtual network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated by the application of network abstraction. These abstractions shall create a virtual network operation environment supporting mobile operators in viewing, managing and operating multi-domains of many dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport, mobile DC edge, mobile DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect, etc.) as a single virtualized network.  This use-case considers the application of these abstractions and the need for the associated operational mechanisms within the network of a single operator.</description>
