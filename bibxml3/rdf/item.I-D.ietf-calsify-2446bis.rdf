    <title>"iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)", Cyrus Daboo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-calsify-2446bis-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a protocol using the iCalendar object specification to provide scheduling interoperability between different calendaring systems.  This is done without reference to a specific transport protocol so as to allow multiple methods of communication between systems.  Subsequent documents will define profiles of this protocol using specific interoperable methods of communications between systems.  iTIP complements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics for group scheduling methods commonly available in current calendaring systems.  These scheduling methods permit two or more calendaring systems to perform transactions such as publish, schedule, reschedule, respond to scheduling requests, negotiation of changes or cancel.</description>
