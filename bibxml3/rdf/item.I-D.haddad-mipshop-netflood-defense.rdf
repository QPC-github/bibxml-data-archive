    <title>"On Using 'Symbiotic Relationship' to Repel Network Flooding Attack", Wassim Haddad, Mats Naslund</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-haddad-mipshop-netflood-defense-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a simple defense mechanism against a specific type of network flooding attacks.  The suggested mechanism requires a mobile node to establish a 'symbiotic relationship' with the infrastructure, in order to empower it to repel such attack while giving enough insurance to the source(s) of the traffic about the need to cease sending traffic to the targeted network.</description>
