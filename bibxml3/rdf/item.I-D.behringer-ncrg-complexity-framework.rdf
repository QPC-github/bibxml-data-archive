    <description>Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of a graph or software.  While it may be impossible to define a metric for overall network complexity, there is a desire to better understand the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services.  This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity, as well as some practical examples for trade-offs in networking.  This document summarizes the work of the IRTF's Network Complexity Research Group (NCRG) at the time of its closure.  It does not present final results, but a snapshot of an ongoing activity, as a basis for future work.</description>
