    <description>In this document, a method of exchanging IPsec key information based on security descriptions [sdesc] framework is defined. By making use of this method, it is possible to negotiate IPsec with the offer- answer model with SDP [RFC3264] in order to protect a media session. Necessary extensions to security descriptions are also defined.</description>
