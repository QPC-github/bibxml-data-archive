    <description>Tapping  technologies  provide  traffic  visibility  to  network analysis tools such as monitors, traffic recorders and security systems. Current tapping architectures and protocols are vendor specific and adapted to legacy networks.  Emerging networking such as large scale datacenters for cloud applications and Mobile backhaul networks demand accurate and fast network traffic visibility. These networks are built on Layer 2 technologies  and  infrastructure  to  support  virtual  machines mobility, growing number of devices including mobile users.  SmarTap architecture is designed to support emerging network requirements  allowing  network  analysis  tools  to  gain  full visibility of network traffic. SmarTap technology monitors each link and each component of the network. It captures packets, classifies them and sends them to tools with relevant packet attributes.  SmarTap  can  provide  attributes  such  as  flow-ID, tapping-location, tapping-time and statistics.</description>
