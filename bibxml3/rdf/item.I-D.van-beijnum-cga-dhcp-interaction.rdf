    <description>Cryptographically Generated Addresses as defined for IPv6 Secure Neighbor Discovery are generated locally on the host using the CGA. However, it can be desireable for other systems to be involved in the generation and use of CGAs in a number of ways: offloading the heavy cryptography for generating or validating CGAs, proxy-generation of CGAs for hosts that don't support the CGA-related protocols themselves or registration of CGA addresses for the purposes of central address administration.  When additional hosts are involved in aspects of CGA, it's necessary to discover these other hosts and/or additional configuration items such as the Sec value.  The DHCPv6 is a natural choice for doing this.  This document provides an overview of the opportunities and issues in this area.</description>
