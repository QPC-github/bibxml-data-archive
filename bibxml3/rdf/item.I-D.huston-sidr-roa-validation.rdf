    <title>"Validation of Route Origination in BGP using the Resource Certificate PKI", Geoff Huston, George Michaelson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huston-sidr-roa-validation-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an application of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure to validate the origination of routes advertised in the Border Gateway Protocol.  The proposed application is intended to fit within the requirements for adding security to inter-domain routing, including the ability to support incremental and piecemeal deployment, and does not require any changes to the specification of BGP.</description>
