    <description>This memo describes the SMTP service extension for checkpoint/resume, which allows a client to recover from a lost connection to the server without having to repeat all of the commands and message content sent prior to the interruption, and with less risk of duplicated messages. It also includes an updated specification of the predecessor SMTP service extension for checkpoint/restart.</description>
