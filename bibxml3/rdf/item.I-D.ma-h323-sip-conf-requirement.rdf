    <description>H.323 conference system is well defined and widely deployed today. It is important for SIP UA, both IPv4 and IPv6, to access H.323 conference system. This document defines an architecture for a SIP UA to access H.323 conference system. The requirements for the elements in this architecture are examined. Also the transition scenario for IPv6 SIP UA to access IPv4 H.323 conference system is discussed.</description>
