    <title>"The Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol", Dick Hardt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardt-xauth-protocol-14.txt</link>
    <description>Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/or resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release of identity claims to a server.  Client software can then request access to resources and/or identity claims by calling the server.  The server acquires consent and authorization from the user and/or resource owner if required, and then returns to the client software the authorization and identity claims that were approved.  This protocol may be extended on many dimensions.</description>
