    <title>"Framework for GMPLS and PCE Control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON)", Greg Bernstein</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-rwa-wson-framework-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON).  In particular, it examines Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) of optical paths.  This document focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common across different WSON environments as such it does not address optical impairments in any depth.</description>
