    <description>Asymmetrical link based time-sensitive traffic flows with highly reliable shortest end-to-end route discovery is pre-requisite in IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6tisch) Networks.  To achieve, this document specifies a resource reservation based reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for hop-by-hop routing (storing mode) based on Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) RPL protocol for 6tisch Networks.  Two separate instances are used to achieve directional paths based on asymmetric links in between source and destination.</description>
