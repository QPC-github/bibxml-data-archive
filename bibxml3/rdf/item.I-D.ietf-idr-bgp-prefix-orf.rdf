    <description>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP, termed "Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to perform address prefix based route filtering. This ORF-type supports prefix length or range based matching, wild-card based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching for address families.</description>
