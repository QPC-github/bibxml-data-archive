    <description>IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications makes it impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for each host by the policy server.  In order to enable it, we define a protocol which is based on the residential gateway sending some parameters such as IPv6 addresses of each host (3GPP UE or fixed host) to the edge router.  The edge router in its turn establishes IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive the quality of service parameters.  The edge router enforces this quality of service which is specific to the host on its traffic both uplink and downlink. When the host disconnects or leaves the network, IP-CAN sub-session is terminated.</description>
