    <description>The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for the deployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS-controlled networks. The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an appropriate technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP TE LSPs.  This document describes an experiment to provide procedures and extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) for the computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.</description>
