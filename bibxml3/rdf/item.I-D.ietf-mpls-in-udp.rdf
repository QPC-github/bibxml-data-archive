    <title>"Encapsulating MPLS in UDP", Xiaohu Xu, Nischal Sheth, Lucy Yong, Ross Callon, David Black</title>

    <description>This document specifies an IP-based encapsulation for MPLS, called MPLS-in-UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for situations where UDP encapsulation is preferred to direct use of MPLS, e.g., to enable UDP-based ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Pathing) or link aggregation.  The MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation technology must only be deployed within a single network (with a single network operator) or networks of an adjacent set of co-operating network operators where traffic is managed to avoid congestion, rather than over the Internet where congestion control is required.  Usage restrictions apply to MPLS-in- UDP usage for traffic that is not congestion controlled and to UDP zero checksum usage with IPv6.</description>
