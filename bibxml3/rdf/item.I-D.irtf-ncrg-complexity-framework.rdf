    <title>"A Framework for Defining Network Complexity", Michael Behringer, Geoff Huston</title>

    <description>Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term.  Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research papers, but most of these address only a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of a graph or software.  There is a desire to define the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity.</description>
