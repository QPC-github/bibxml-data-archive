    <description>This draft describes the separation of service forwarding function and service delivery function abstractions, along with the mechanics of NSH encapsulated packet forwarding with such separation, in SFC deployments.  This separation frees the service functions from making forwarding decisions and the necessary control plane integration, thereby keeping the service functions simple and focused on service delivery. Further, this separation fully contains the forwarding decisions in forwarding functions, thereby allowing implementations to enforce integrity of the forwarding state carried in NSH which in turn is required for correctly forwarding NSH encapsulated packets.</description>
