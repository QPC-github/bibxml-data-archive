    <description>NOTE: The authors recognize that the statistical models that would inform the process are not well understood and that the possibilities to game the system might be unmountable.  Unless we reach more insights on how to deal with this details this work is abandoned.  Sometimes, a DNS name is known to be in use in the wild even though it was never properly delegated.  This situation appears particularly, but not only, true in certain domains near the root of the tree: people have independently used those non-existent top-level domains as private namespaces.  If those names are to be delegated in the public DNS, prudence dictates that collisions between the private uses and the public use be minimized.  We outline a procedure to evaluate the harm of delegation.</description>
