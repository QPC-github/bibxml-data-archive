    <description>This document provides an informative overview of possible use cases where ECN marking can be used for inelastic traffic.  It outlines benefits of preserving the ECN support in a PCN domain.  As ECN provides with a simple mechanism for network nodes to inform the end points about possible upcoming congestion and resulting packet losses and delay increase, the scheme can be useful for adaptive real-time media applications, thus enabling them to adjust the transmission rate to avoid quality degradation due to congestion.  By showing the benefits of ECN this memo asks the working group to consider end to end ECN support in PCN domain.</description>
