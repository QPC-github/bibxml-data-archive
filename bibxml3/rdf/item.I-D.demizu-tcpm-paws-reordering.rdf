    <title>"A Modification to Make PAWS Robust to Segment Reordering", Noritoshi Demizu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-demizu-tcpm-paws-reordering-01.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequence numbers), defined in RFC1323, is to protect a TCP connection against old duplicate segments from the same connection. There is a possibility, however, that PAWS may discard valid reordered segments. This memo proposes a modification to PAWS to solve this problem.</description>
