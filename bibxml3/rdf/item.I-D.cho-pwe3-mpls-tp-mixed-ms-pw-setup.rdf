    <description>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) transport paths can be statically provisioned via a Network Management System (NMS) or dynamically provisioned via a control plane. The transport paths provided by MPLS-TP are used as a server layer for pseudowires carrying client signals other than IP or MPLS. It may be necessary to support MPLS-TP pseudowires, to extend across multiple domains.  This document outlines the requirements and solution for coordinating MPLS-TP transport paths and a multi-segment PWs that will traverse multiple domains, where some domains are statically provisioned, and other domains that are dynamically provisioned.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
