    <title>"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Context EngineID Discovery", Juergen Schoenwaelder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-opsawg-snmp-engineid-discovery-03.txt</link>
    <description>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version three (SNMPv3) requires that an application knows the identifier (snmpEngineID) of the remote SNMP protocol engine in order to retrieve or manipulate objects maintained on the remote SNMP entity.  This document introduces a well-known localEngineID and a discovery mechanism which can be used to learn the snmpEngineID of a remote SNMP protocol engine.  The proposed mechanism is independent of the features provided by SNMP security models and may also be used by other protocol interfaces providing access to managed objects.  This document updates RFC 3411.</description>
