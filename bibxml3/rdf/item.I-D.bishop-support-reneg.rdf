    <title>"TLS Renegotiation Support Extension to HTTP/2", Mike Bishop</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bishop-support-reneg-00.txt</link>
    <description>The HTTP/2 spec requires that TLS renegotiation not be employed when the negotiated application protocol is HTTP/2.  This document defines an extension to HTTP/2 which permits renegotiation to be employed by peers which mutually consent to do so, while allowing peers to understand whether renegotiation is permitted before attempting it.</description>
