    <title>"File Transfer Protocol HOST Command for Virtual Hosts", Paul Hethmon, Robert McMurray</title>

    <description>The File Transfer Protocol, as defined in RFC 959, does not provide a way for FTP clients and servers to differentiate between multiple DNS names that are registered for a single IP address.  This document defines a new FTP command that provides a mechanism for FTP clients and servers to identify individual virtual hosts on an FTP server.</description>
