    <description>This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric Networking.  Information-Centric Networking is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support information distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication.  Challenges include naming, security, routing, system scalability, mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-network caching, and network management.</description>
