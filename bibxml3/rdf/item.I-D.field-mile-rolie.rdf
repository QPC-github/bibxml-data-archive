    <description>This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security information sharing.  Using this approach, a CSIRT or other stakeholder may share and exchange representations of cyber security incidents, indicators, and other related information as Web- addressable resources.  The transport protocol binding is specified as HTTP(S) with a MIME media type of Atom+XML.  An appropriate set of link relation types specific to cyber security information sharing is defined.  The resource representations leverage the existing IODEF [RFC5070] and RID [RFC6545] specifications as appropriate. Coexistence with deployments that conform to existing specifications including RID [RFC6545] and Transport of Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS [RFC6546] is supported via appropriate use of HTTP status codes.</description>
