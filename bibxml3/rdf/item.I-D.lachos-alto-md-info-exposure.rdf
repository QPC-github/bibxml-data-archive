    <description>A common setting in emerging applications (e.g., data-intensive science applications, flexible inter-domain routing, multi-domain service function chaining) is that the traffic from a source to a destination traverses multiple networks domains.  Such multi-domain applications can benefit from network information exposure using ALTO.  This document summarizes the benefits of using such multi- domain information and discusses the ALTO design issues for gathering it.  Besides, it also presents key design requirements to be addressed in order to realize the proposal of providing multi-domain information by ALTO services.  Finally, another important objective of this document is to begin discussions into the ALTO WG concerning potential new items to be considered for the re-charter.</description>
