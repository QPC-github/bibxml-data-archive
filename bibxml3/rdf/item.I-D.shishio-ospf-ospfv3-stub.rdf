    <description>OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the R-bit if a router is an active router and should be taken into consideration as a transit device.  Another method available is the v6-bit indicating if a router or link should be excluded from IPv6 routing calculations.  A direct result is that OSPFv3 has "no transit capability" potentially based upon the setting of R-bit and V6-bit, unlike the stub OSPFv2 router functionality.  This feature proposal has as purpose to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior into OSPFv3 to keep the operational service provider experience used to deploy, troubleshoot and be familiar with OSPFv2 stub routing.  OSPFv3 has similar metric field information field of all of LSAs, with exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137 method can be re-utilized in OSPFv3.  To drive consistency between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, there should be next to supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for"max-metric".</description>
