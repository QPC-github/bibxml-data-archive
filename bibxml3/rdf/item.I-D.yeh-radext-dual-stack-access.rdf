    <title>"RADIUS Attributes for Dual Stack Access", Leaf Yeh, Tina Tsou (Ting ZOU)</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yeh-radext-dual-stack-access-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the RADIUS attributes for IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack access, which are intended to be used in the AAA processes for the transfer of user's configuration from AAA server to NAS and traffic statistics reporting from NAS to AAA server.  The new attributes cover a specified user type for NAS to allocate the proper resource and employ the right mechanism for the users; and a batch of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics for the differentiated accounting policies on the AAA server.</description>
