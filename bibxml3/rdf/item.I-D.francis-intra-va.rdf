    <description>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the most costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.  FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected RIB entries into the FIB.  Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any and all routers, easily by an order of magnitude with negligible increase in path length and load.  FIB suppression deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</description>
