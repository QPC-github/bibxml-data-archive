    <title>"Mounting Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers", Julian  Reschke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-reschke-webdav-mount-05.txt</link>
    <description>In current Web browsers, there is no uniform way to specify that a user clicking on a link will be presented with an editable view of a WebDAV server. For example, it is frequently desirable to be able to click on a link, and have this link open a window that can handle drag and drop interaction with the resources of a WebDAV server. This document specifies a mechanism and a document format that enables Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers to send "mounting" information to a WebDAV client. The mechanism is designed to work on any platform and with any combination of browser and WebDAV client, relying solely on the well-understood dispatch of documents through their MIME type.</description>
