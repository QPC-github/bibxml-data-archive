    <title>"SubRTCP:RTCP Extension for Internal Monitoring of RTP Sessions.", Xiaode Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xu-avt-subrtcp-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes SubRTCP, an extension to RTCP. SubRTCP operates on the same underlying transport establishement as for RTCP but functions independently of the latter. SubRTCP extends RTCP to the middle nodes of an RTP session to allow monitoring of its data delivery also at and between these middle nodes. Such an internal visibility provided by SubRTCP at the middle nodes complements the delivery monitoring by RTCP at the endpoints particularly in service providers' interest.</description>
