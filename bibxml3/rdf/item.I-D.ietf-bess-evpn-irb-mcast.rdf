        <description>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area Network (LAN), comprising a single IP subnet, to be divided into multiple "segments".  Each segment may be located at a different site, and the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone. Intra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to the endusers to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over the IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single "tenant" owns multiple such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs. This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet IP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant, while still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the inter- subnet multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic to leave a given router and then reenter that same router.  These procedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that needs to travel to or from systems that are outside the EVPN domain.</description>
