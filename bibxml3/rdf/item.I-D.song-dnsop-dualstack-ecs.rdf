    <description>During the period of IPv6 transition, IP-based Geolocation (GeoIP) applications are identified as a challenge and speed bump for ICPs (Internet Content Providers) to migrating their service to IPv6. Some studies and operational experiences show that the accuracy of IPv6 GeoIP is relatively poor in comparison to their IPv4 counterparts.  This memo proposed to include client's dualstack subnets into DNS queries to provide better IPv6 GeoIP.  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test script is currently placed at GitHub [Dualstack-ECS-GitHub]. Comments and pull request are welcome.</description>
