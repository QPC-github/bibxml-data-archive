        <description>This document introduces a new type of segment, Tunnel Segment, for the segment routing (SR).  Tunnel segment can be used to reduce SID stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or provide differentiated services.  Forwarding mechanisms and requirements of control plane and data models for tunnel segments are also defined.</description>
