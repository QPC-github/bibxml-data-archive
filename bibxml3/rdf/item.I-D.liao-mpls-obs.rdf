    <description>Protection and restoration at optical layer is critical to network integrity since data is transmitted and switched at a considerably high speed in optical domain. A few second halt may cause tens to thousands gigabit loss. Optical burst switching is a promising technology, bridging optical circuit switching and optical package switching. Unlike optical circuit switching and time division multiplexing, OBS is featured with unidirectional reservation and statistical multiplexing of wavelength resources. The general idea behind protection and restoration techniques is to utilize redundant bandwidth resources as backup. The flexibility brought by OBS provides alternatives for existed protection and restoration schemes at optical layer.</description>
