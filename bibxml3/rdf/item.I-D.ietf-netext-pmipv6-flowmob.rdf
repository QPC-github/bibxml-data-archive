    <title>"Proxy Mobile IPv6 Extensions to Support Flow Mobility", Carlos Bernardos</title>

    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  This document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.  This document updates RFC 5213.  The extensions described in this document consist of the operations performed by the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of the mobile node, as well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network to ensure consistent flow mobility management.</description>
