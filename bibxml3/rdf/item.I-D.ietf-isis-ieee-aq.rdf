    <title>"IS-IS Extensions Supporting IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging", Don Fedyk, Peter Ashwood-Smith</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-isis-ieee-aq-05.txt</link>
    <description>802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) is being standardized by the IEEE as the next step in the evolution of the various spanning tree and registration protocols. 802.1aq allows for true shortest path forwarding in a mesh Ethernet network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths. This permits it to support much larger layer 2 topologies, with faster convergence, and vastly improved use of the mesh topology. Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership, which includes point-to-point, point-to-multi-point and multi-point-to-multipoint variations. This memo documents the IS-IS changes required to support this IEEE protocol and provides some context and examples.</description>
