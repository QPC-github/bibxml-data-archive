    <title>"Framework and Requirements for a Layer 2 Control Protocol (L2CP) in  Broadband Multi-Service Networks", Sven Ooghe</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ooghe-l2cp-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for a Layer 2 Control Protocol (L2CP) mechanism between a service-oriented layer 3 edge device (e.g. a BRAS) and a layer 2 Access Node (e.g. a DSLAM) in a multi-service architecture. This mechanism allows to perform QoS- related, service-related and subscriber-related operations. The Layer 2 Control mechanism ensures the transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather using a direct device-device communication. This document does not specify design requirements for network elements.</description>
