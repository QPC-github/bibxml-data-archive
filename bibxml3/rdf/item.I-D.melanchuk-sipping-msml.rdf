    <title>"Media Sessions Markup Language (MSML)", Tim Melanchuk, Garland Sharratt</title>

    <description>The Media Sessions Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. Clients can use it define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individual or groups of users. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can use MSML with other languages such as the Media Objects Markup Language (MOML) or VoiceXML to interact with individual users or with groups of conference participants.</description>
