    <title>"PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-xmpp-posh-06.txt</link>
    <description>Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenant environments.  As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain.  Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security.  This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols.  While these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.</description>
