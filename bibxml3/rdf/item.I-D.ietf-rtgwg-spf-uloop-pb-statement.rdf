    <description>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.  In this document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using different Link State IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) implementations in a single network, with respect to micro-loops.  The analysis is focused on the SPF (Shortest Path First) delay algorithm.</description>
