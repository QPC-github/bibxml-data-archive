    <title>"The Architecture of an RBridge Solution to TRILL", Eric Gray, Joseph Touch, Radia Perlman</title>

    <description>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use a routing protocol as a control plane. This combines several of the benefits of the link layer with those of the network layer. For example RBridges use existing link state routing, without necessarily requiring configuration, to improve aggregate throughput, for RBridge to RBridge traffic. RBridges also may support IP multicast and IP address resolution optimizations. They are intended to be applicable to L2 network sizes similar to those of conventional bridges and are intended to be backward compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress and transit. They also support VLANs (although this generally requires configuration) while otherwise attempting to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges. This document proposes an architecture for RBridge systems as a solution to the TRILL problem, defines terminology, and describes basic components and desired behavior. One (or more) separate documents will specify protocols and mechanisms that satisfy the architecture presented herein.</description>
