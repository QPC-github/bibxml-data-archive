    <description>WebDAV consists of a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance). RFC2518 was published in February 1999, and this specification makes minor revisions mostly due to interoperability experience.</description>
