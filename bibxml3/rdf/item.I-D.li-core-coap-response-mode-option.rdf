    <title>"CoAP Option Extension : Response-Mode", Kepeng Li, Bert Greevenbosch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-core-coap-response-mode-option-00.txt</link>
    <description>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  Two response modes are defined: Piggy-backed Response and Separate Response.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, to indicate in the request the required response mode, and also the required response time.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</description>
