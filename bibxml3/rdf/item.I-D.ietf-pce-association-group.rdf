    <title>"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", Ina Minei, Edward Crabbe, Siva Sivabalan, Hariharan Ananthakrishnan, Dhruv Dhody, Yosuke Tanaka</title>

    <description>This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in the context of a Path Computation Element (PCE).  This grouping can then be used to define associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviours), and is equally applicable to the stateful PCE (active and passive modes) as well as the stateless PCE.</description>
