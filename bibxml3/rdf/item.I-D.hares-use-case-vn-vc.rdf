    <description>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to the third-party applications running in software.  The application can utilize a programmable interface to receiving these virtual or abstract resources in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation of resources.  Various programmatic interfaces have been proposed to interface directly to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES), or do device configuration (NETCONF).  ALTO has proposed a informational interface to the application.  Only the progammatic Interface to the Routing System (IRS) provides an interface directly to the routing system to utilize all aspects of the routing system as a system.  The IRS system interacts with the control plane processes to monitor best paths to any destination and to change the routing information base (RIB) or MPLS label information Base (LIB) which feeds the forwarding tables the information needed to actually switch traffic at a local level.  This document outlines how SDN networks can use the IRS interface to implement an automated set of network services for Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD)</description>
