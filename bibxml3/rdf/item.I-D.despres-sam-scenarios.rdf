    <title>"IPv4-IPv6 Coexistence Scenarios based on Stateless Address Mapping", Remi  Despres</title>

    <description>As each global IPv4 address will be shared among more and more customers, and as more and more NATs will be deployed in ISP infrastructures, the lack of end-to-end transparency and the limited scalability of some NATs are likely to cause increasing difficulties to customers and to ISPs.  This document introduces IPv4-IPv6 coexistence scenarios where IPv4 addresses are shared with good scalability and, in favorable configurations, with full IPv4 end-to- end transparency.  For this, the key tool is the Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) of draft-despres-SAM-00, with in particular its extended IPv4 addressing (IPv4E) in which port prefixes are used as IPv4 address extensions.  For each considered scenario, Static Address Mappers (SAMs) are deployed at scenario specific places.</description>
