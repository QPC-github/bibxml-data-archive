    <title>"Bounding Longer Routes to Remove TE", Susan Hares</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-white-bounded-longest-match-02.txt</link>
    <description>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size of the routing table they use and propagate.  This draft explores an alternative to length-based filters which allows for more automatic configuration and which provides for better redundancy.  Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method of modifying the BGP [RFC1771] longest match algorithm by setting a bound on the prefix lengths eligible for preference.  A bound would operate on long prefixes when covering route announcements are available; in certain circumstances it would cause a router to prefer an aggregate over a more specific route announcement.</description>
