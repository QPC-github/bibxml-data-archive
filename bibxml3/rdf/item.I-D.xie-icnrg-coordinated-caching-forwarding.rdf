    <description>Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric Networking (ICN).  Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en- route hierarchical caching mechanism; additionally, caching and forwarding are largely uncoordinated in these designs.  This draft describes a coordinated caching and forwarding design to improve content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.</description>
