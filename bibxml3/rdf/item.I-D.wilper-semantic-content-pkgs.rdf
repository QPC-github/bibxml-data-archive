    <description>This document specifies Semantic Content Packages, an experimental data structure and associated format for storing and transmitting a named set of RDF statements with a set of content streams.  Packages can be arranged as a set of files in a directory hierarchy or serialized into a single stream for transmission and archival storage.  For the latter, a new ZIP-based media type, application/scp, is defined.</description>
