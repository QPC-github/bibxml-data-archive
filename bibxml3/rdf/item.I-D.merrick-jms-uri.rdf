    <title>"URI Scheme for Java(tm) Message Service 1.0", Mark Phillips, Phil Adams, Derek Rokicki, Eric Johnson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-merrick-jms-uri-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) as defined in [RFC3986], for designating connections and destination addresses used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS) [REF-JMS].  It was originally designed for particular uses, but applies generally wherever a JMS URI is needed to describe the connection to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS destination.  The syntax of this 'jms' URI is not compatible with previously existing, but unregistered 'jms' URI schemes.  However, the expressiveness of the scheme described herein should satisfy the requirements of all existing circumstances.</description>
