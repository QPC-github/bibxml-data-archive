    <title>"Requirements on I-D Tracker Extensions for Working Group Chairs", Henrik  Levkowetz, Allison Mankin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-proto-wgchair-tracker-ext-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the changes required to make it possible for working group chairs to update the I-D tracker during document shepherding, after the request for publication. It also describes additional requirements for the chairs to use the I-D tracker for managing WG documents from their earliest stages. Having the tracker support the working groups more fully is a primary benefit, but in addition, this moves towards the goal of providing an integrated view of document states from -00 to RFC publication.</description>
