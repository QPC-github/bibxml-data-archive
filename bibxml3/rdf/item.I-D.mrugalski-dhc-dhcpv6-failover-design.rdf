    <title>"DHCPv6 Failover Design", Tomasz Mrugalski, Kim Kinnear</title>

    <description>DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy.  This document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for running two servers on the same network with capability for either server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or network partition.  This is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is not protocol specification document.  It is a second document in a planned series of three documents.  DHCPv6 failover requirements are specified in [requirements].  A protocol specification document is planned to follow this document.</description>
