    <title>"Simple and Efficient Read Support for Sparse Files", Dean Hildebrand, Marc Eshel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hildebrand-nfsv4-read-sparse-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a new READPLUS operation for NFSv4.2 to support efficient reading of sparse files, which are growing in the data center due to the increasing number of virtual disk images. READPLUS has all the features and functionality of READ, but has an extensible return value that includes an easy and efficient way for administrators to copy and manage sparse files without wasting disk space or transferring data unnecessarily.</description>
