    <title>"Using TLS on a New Port for Privacy Between DNS Stub and Recursive Resolvers", Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-dprive-dns-tls-newport-00.txt</link>
    <description>DNS queries and responses can contain information that reveals important information about the person who caused the queries, and it would be better if eavesdroppers were unable to see DNS traffic. This document describes how to use TLS for encrypting DNS traffic between a system acting as a DNS stub resolver and a system acting as a DNS recursive resolver.  It defines how to transport DNS queries and responses under TLS on a port that will be assigned when this document is published.  Discussion of this draft should take place in the DPRIVE WG.</description>
