    <description>MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS in short) is an MPLS data plane-based source routing paradigm in which a sender of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network by imposing stacked MPLS labels to the packet.  SR-MPLS could be leveraged to realize a unified source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4 and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS label stack as a unified source routing instruction set while preserving backward compatibility with SR-MPLS.</description>
