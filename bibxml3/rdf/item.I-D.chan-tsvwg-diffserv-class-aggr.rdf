    <description>In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation is still needed to support applications' utilization of the network. Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into different diffserv service classes based on end-to-end behavior requirements of the applications. However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding treatment satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of two or more service classes. For such cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more service classes into a forwarding treatment. This document provides guidelines for aggregation of service classes into forwarding treatments.</description>
