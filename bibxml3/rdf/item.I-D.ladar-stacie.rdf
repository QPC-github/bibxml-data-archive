    <title>"Safely Turn Authentication Credentials Into Entropy (STACIE)", Ladar Levison</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ladar-stacie-03.pdf</link>
    <description>This document specifies a method for Safely Turning Authentication Credentials Into Entropy (STACIE) using an efficient Zero Knowledge Password Proof (ZKPP), and is provided as a standalone component suitable for use as a building block in other protocol development efforts.  The scheme was created to fill the emerging need for a standard which allows a single low entropy password to be used for user authentication and the derivation of strong encryption keys. The design is modular, and is conservative in its use of an arbitrary one-way cryptographic hash function.  The security of the scheme depends on the difficulty associated with reversing the hash function output back into the plain text input.  STACIE attempts to make discovering the plain text input through the use of brute force more difficult by correlating the amount of processing to the length of a user's plain text password.  The shorter the plain text password, the more processing is required, with the amount of additional, artificially required, work scaling exponentially for each character.</description>
