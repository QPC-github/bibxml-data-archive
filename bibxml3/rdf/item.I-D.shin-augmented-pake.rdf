    <title>"Efficient Augmented Password-Only Authentication and Key Exchange for IKEv2", SeongHan Shin, Kazukuni Kobara</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shin-augmented-pake-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an efficient augmented password-only authentication and key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in the intended server.  In general, the user password is chosen from a small set of dictionary whose space is within the off-line dictionary attacks.  The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against passive attacks, active attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security).  In addition, this document describes how the AugPAKE protocol is integrated into IKEv2.</description>
