    <description>Rapidly-varying conditions in a cellular network can cause problems for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which in turn can degrade application performance.  This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles.  It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a mobile throughput guidance exposure mechanism that can be used to assist TCP in cellular networks, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced service delivery performance.  The proposed mechanism can be applied to any content or TCP/IP based application content delivery.  This document describes the applicability of the mechanism for Intelligent Video Acceleration over cellular networks.</description>
