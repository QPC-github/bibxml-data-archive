    <description>Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly important functionality that needs to be provided in the Internet. This document proposes the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP), named Metering NSLP (M-NSLP), which allows the dynamic configuration of Metering Entities on the data path. An accompanying document [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework] provides a problem statement, describes scenarios where such a path-coupled configuration of Metering Entities is useful, elaborates requirements for a path-coupled protocol for the configuration of Metering Entities and discusses the applicability of NSIS for this purpose. This document defines a Metering NSLP protocol design and messages, and describes the protocol operation.</description>
