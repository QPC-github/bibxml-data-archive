    <title>"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent (UA) URIs (GRUU) in the  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-gruu-15.txt</link>
    <description>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI that can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance.  A URI that routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU).  This document describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a GRUU from a registrar and for communicating a GRUU to a peer within a dialog.</description>
