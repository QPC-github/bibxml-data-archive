        <description>This document describes a simple "index table" data structure and its associated ICN data objects for organizing a set of primitive ICN data objects into a large, File-Like ICN Collection (FLIC).  At the core of this collection is a _manifest_ which acts as the collection's root node.  The manifest contains an index table with pointers, each pointer being a hash value pointing to either a final data block or another index table node.</description>
