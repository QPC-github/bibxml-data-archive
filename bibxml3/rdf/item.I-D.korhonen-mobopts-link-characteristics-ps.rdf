    <title>"Link Characteristic Information for IP Mobility Problem Statement", Jouni  Korhonen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-korhonen-mobopts-link-characteristics-ps-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses the problem space related to frequent changes in the local link or sub-path characteristics of a mobile node due to various reasons such as vertical handovers and the delivery of the sub-path characteristic information from a mobile node to its peer nodes. The purpose of this document is to define the scope and requirements for possible future work on a generic sub-path characteristic information delivery mechanism for optimizing IP mobility performance and reducing the implications that significant changes in the local link or sub-path characteristics tend to create to the transport and application protocol behaviour by altering the end-to-end path properties.</description>
