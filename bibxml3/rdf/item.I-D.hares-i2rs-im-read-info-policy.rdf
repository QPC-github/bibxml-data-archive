    <description>The Interface to the routing system (I2RS) specifies a new interface that a client (I2RS client) can utilize to interface to the routing system.  Some applications that utilize the services of I2RS client may require a specific set of data in response to network events or conditions based on pre-established rules.  In order to reduce the data flow through the network, the I2RS client needs to signal the I2RS agent to filter some of the collected data or events prior to transmission to the i2rs client.  This functionality is necessary to meet the requirements I2RS enabled services which include service- layer routing improvements, and control of traffic flows and exit points.  This document introduces a read-only I2RS RIB policy Informational Model that provides filters for the reads and notifications from the I2RS RIB Info Model (IM).  This model utilizes a generic information model (IM) for policy templates that is extensible and hierarchical. These templates support the features described by the I2RS architectural model.</description>
