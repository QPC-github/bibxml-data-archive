    <description>Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection is an interoperable modification of the existing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC2461) and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (RFC2462) process. The intention is to minimize address configuration delays in the successful case, to reduce disruption as far as possible in the failure case and to remain interoperable with unmodified hosts and routers.</description>
