    <title>""With-config-state" Capability for NETCONF/RESTCONF", Robert Wilton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilton-netmod-opstate-yang-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a possible alternative solution for handling applied configuration state in YANG as described in draft-openconfig- netmod-opstate-01.  The proposed solution, roughly modelled on the with-defaults NETCONF/RESTCONF capability, aims to meet the key requirements set out in draft-ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs-01 without the need for YANG module authors to explicitly duplicate configuration nodes in both configuration and operational containers.  This draft does not address the issue of co-location of configuration and operational state for interfaces, nor does it provide a NETCONF mechanism to retrieve operational data separately from configuration data.</description>
