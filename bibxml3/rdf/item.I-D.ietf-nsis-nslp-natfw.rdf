    <description>This memo defines the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls.  This NSLP allows hosts to signal on the data path for NATs and firewalls to be configured according to the needs of the application data flows.  For instance, it enables hosts behind NATs to obtain a public reachable address and hosts behind firewalls to receive data traffic.  The overall architecture is given by the framework and requirements defined by the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group.  The network scenarios, the protocol itself, and examples for path-coupled signaling are given in this memo.</description>
