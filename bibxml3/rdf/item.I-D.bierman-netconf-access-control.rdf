    <title>"Network Configuration Protocol Access Control Model", Andy Bierman, Martin Bjorklund</title>

    <description>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with the NETCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating environment, which promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for particular users to a pre- configured subset of all available NETCONF operations and content. This document discusses requirements for a suitable access control model, and provides one solution which meets these requirements.</description>
