    <description>This document discusses handover management scheme for WLAN handover across different IP subnets.  To achieve seamless handover, the following three requirements should be satisfied.  (I) prompt and reliable detection of degradation in wireless link quality, (II) elimination of handover processing delay on layer 2 and 3, (III) selection of a better WLAN.  We then describe our proposed handover management scheme satisfying these requirements, and explain an architecture design and implementation for our proposed scheme.</description>
