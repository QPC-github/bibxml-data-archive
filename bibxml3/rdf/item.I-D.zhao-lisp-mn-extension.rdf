    <description>LISP describes a network-based protocol that enables separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure.  The LISP Mobile Node extension design described in this document uses standard LISP functionality to provide scalable mobility for LISP mobile nodes.  This document extends the lisp, it introduces some contents that lisp does not include but the author think it is important and recommendation them to be considered in the lisp.</description>
