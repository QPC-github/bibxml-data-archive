    <title>"Use-case and Requirements for Multi-domain Operation Plane Change", Toshiaki Suzuki</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-suzuki-teas-actn-multidomain-opc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a use-case and requirements that address the need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes virtually prepared multiple networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one to a backup one during scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as a network disaster.  Specifically, the necessity of interfaces to establish consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</description>
