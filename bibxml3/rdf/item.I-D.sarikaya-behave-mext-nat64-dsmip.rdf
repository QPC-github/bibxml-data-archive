    <title>"NAT64 for Dual Stack Mobile IPv6", Behcet Sarikaya, Frank Xia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sarikaya-behave-mext-nat64-dsmip-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo specifies modifications required to the home agent to integrate NAT64 with Mobile IP so that IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN) receiving host-based mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) can communicate with IPv4 only servers.  The protocol is based on home agents maintaining a table similar to NAT64 and linking it to the binding cache.  The changes include better keepalive management in order to preserve battery on the mobile node as well as multicast support for NAT64 integrated into the current multicast support scheme in Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile nodes can receive multicast data from IPv4 only content providers.</description>
