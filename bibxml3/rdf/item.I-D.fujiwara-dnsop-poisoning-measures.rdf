    <description>Although the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions has been implemented, cache poisoning is still a big issue.  "ID Guessing and Query Prediction" type cache poisoning is detectable on a full resolver.  TCP transport has strong resistance to cache poisoning attacks.  This document proposes an improvement of full resolvers about the detection and the measure against forged response cache poisoning attacks.</description>
