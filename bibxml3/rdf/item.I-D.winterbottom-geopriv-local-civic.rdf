    <title>"Specifying Civic Address Extensions in PIDF-LO", James Winterbottom, Martin Thomson, Richard Barnes</title>

    <description>New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses.  A backwardly- compatible mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv civic address format is described.  A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions when translating between XML and DHCP civic address forms is defined for entities that need to perform this translation.</description>
