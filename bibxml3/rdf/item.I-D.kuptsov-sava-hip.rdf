    <title>"SAVAH: Source address validation architecture with Host Identity Protocol", Dmitriy Kuptsov, Andrei Gurtov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kuptsov-sava-hip-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an architecture for the source address validation with help of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), SAVAH.  The architecture utilizes the properties of cryptographically strong protocol to authenticate an originator of a network communication. In addition this architecture offers network access control, data protection, host mobilty and multihoming features and is suitable for the wireless networks.  The proposed, architecture is the first-hop router solution, meaning that it should be deployed on the router placed on the edge of a local network topology.</description>
