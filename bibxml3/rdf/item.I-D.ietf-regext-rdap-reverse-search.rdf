        <description>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching a given search pattern.  In the RDAP context, an entity can be associated with any defined object class.  Moreover, other relationships between object classes exist and might be used for providing a reverse search capability.  Therefore, a reverse search can be applied to other use cases than the classic domain-entity scenario.  This document describes RDAP query extensions that allow servers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship defined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related object class.  The reverse search based on the domain-entity relationship is treated as a particular case but with a special focus on its privacy implications.</description>
