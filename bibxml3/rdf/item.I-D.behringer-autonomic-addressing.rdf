    <title>"An Autonomic IPv6 Addressing Scheme", Michael Behringer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-behringer-autonomic-addressing-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a generic IPv6 addressing scheme which is suitable for autonomic nodes, where node addressing must not depend on a centrally managed scheme.  It assumes a unique domain name and device name, and automatically derives a unique IPv6 address from those.  The scheme allows for a flat address hierarchy as well as optionally, when required, the definition of zones which are aggregatable.  This document is for discussion right now; the final addressing scheme should probably move into [I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model].</description>
