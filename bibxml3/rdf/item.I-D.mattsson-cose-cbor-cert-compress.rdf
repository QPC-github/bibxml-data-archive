        <title>"CBOR Encoded X.509 Certificates (C509 Certificates)", Shahid Raza, Joel Hoglund, Goeran Selander, John Mattsson, Martin Furuhed</title>

        <description>This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.  The resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates.  The CBOR encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280 and significantly reduces the size of certificates compatible with e.g.  RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. When used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%.  The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be signed directly ("natively signed"), which does not require re-encoding for the signature to be verified.  The document also specifies COSE headers as well as a TLS certificate type for C509 certificates.  NOTE: "C509" is a placeholder, name to be decided by the COSE WG.</description>
