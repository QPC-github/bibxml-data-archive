    <description>The requirements of SDN controllers including fundamental technical requirements, requirements of the SDN controller architecture and the requirements of the SDN controller functionality are provided.  All these requirements raised are focused on the scalability, reliability, programmability, intercommunity, security and the network management of the SDN controller.Based on the requirements, we have realized the SDN controller based on Opendaylight foused on cloud datacenter.Due to realization, the interface between other devices besides the ovs is not included up to now, while in the actual design, some connections between controller and the forwarding devices such as SDN gateway, firewall, and NAT are added into the requirement of controller.</description>
