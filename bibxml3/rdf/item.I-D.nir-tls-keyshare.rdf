    <title>"A Method for Sharing Record Protocol Keys with a Middlebox in TLS", Yoav Nir</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nir-tls-keyshare-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document contains a straw man proposal for a method for sharing symmetric session keys between a TLS client and a middlebox, so that the middlebox can decrypt the TLS-protected traffic.  This method is an alternative to the middlebox becoming a proxy.</description>
