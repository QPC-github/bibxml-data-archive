    <title>"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE Signalling in support of Automatically  Switched Optical Network (ASON)", John Drake</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-rsvp-te-ason-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies how Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE signaling may be used and extended to satisfy the requirements of the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture specified by the ITU-T. The requirements are in a companion document "Requirements for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Usage and Extensions for Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON)." In particular, this document details the mechanisms for setting up Soft Permanent Connections (SPC), the necessary extensions in delivering full and logical call/connection separation support, the extended restart capabilities during control plane failures, extended label usage and crankback signalling capability. The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any environment (including multi-area) and for any type of interface: packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber switching.</description>
