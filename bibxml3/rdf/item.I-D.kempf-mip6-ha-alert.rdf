    <title>"Extension to RFC 3775 for Alerting the Mobile Node to Home Agent  Unavailability", James Kempf</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kempf-mip6-ha-alert-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 3775 contains no way for a home agent to notify a mobile node that the home agent will shortly become unavailable, and suggest possible substitutes. A mobile node can suddenly find itself without mobility service. This document describes a simple protocol to inform the mobile node when its home agent is about to become unavailable and whether the mobile node should re-run bootstrapping to find a new home agent.</description>
