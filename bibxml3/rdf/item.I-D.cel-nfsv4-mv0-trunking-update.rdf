    <title>"NFS version 4.0 Trunking Update", Chuck Lever, David Noveck</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cel-nfsv4-mv0-trunking-update-00.txt</link>
    <description>Location-related attributes in NFS version 4.0 are used to support the migration and replication of server file systems.  In this document, we describe an additional use for these attributes as a mechanism to enable client discovery of an NFS version 4.0 server's trunking capabilities.  The interaction of trunking with migration and replication is also clarified.  This document updates RFC 7530.</description>
