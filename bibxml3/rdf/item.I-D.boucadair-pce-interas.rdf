    <title>"A Solution for providing inter-AS MPLS-based QoS tunnels", Pierrick Morand, Mohammed Boucadair</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-pce-interas-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a solution for providing inter-AS MPLS-based Quality of Service (QoS) tunnels. This solution makes use of Path Computation Elements (PCE) as a means to compute inter-domain constraint-based paths. Service considerations and agreements between two IP Network Providers (INP) implementing this solution are also described.</description>
