    <title>"Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF) : A Syntax Used to Form Encoding Rules in  Various Routing Protocol Specifications", Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-farrel-rtg-common-bnf-09.txt</link>
    <description>Several protocols have been specified in the Routing Area of the IETF using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax. However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF.  There is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation.  Updating existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented would be a substantial piece of work.  This document provides a formal definition of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF), and makes it available for use by new protocols.</description>
