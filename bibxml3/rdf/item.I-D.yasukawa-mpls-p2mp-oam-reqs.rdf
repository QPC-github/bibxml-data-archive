    <title>"OAM Requirements for Point-to-Multipoint MPLS Networks", Seisho Yasukawa</title>

    <description>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point MPLS LSPs the requirement to detect, handle and diagnose control and dataplane defects is critical. For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs the detection and specification of how to handle those defects is important because such defects may not only affect the fundamental of an MPLS network, but also because they MAY impact service level specification commitments for customers of their network.</description>
