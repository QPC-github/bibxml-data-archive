    <description>This document describes a standard way to store the configuration and the results of traceroute measurements.  This document first of all describes the terminology used in this document and the traceroute tool itself; afterwards, the common information model is defined dividing the information elements in two semantically separated groups (configuration elements and results elements).  Moreover an additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and results elements by means of a common unique identifier.  On the basis of the information model a data model based on XML is defined to store the results of traceroute measurements.</description>
