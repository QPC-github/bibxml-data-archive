    <description>In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, which filters harmful traffic from outside at the border of the site. This 'Border Defense Model', provides only a single line of defence and hinders the deployment of many next-generation Internet applications and services. This memo surveys the security issues of the 'Border Defense Model', and proposes a network architecture 'Quarantine Model', to provide a better security model and promote various end-to-end Internet usages. In our 'Quarantine Model', nodes shareing an Enterprise network network are connected to separate logical networks according to their security privilege level and community of interest. A different security policy is implemented on each logical network segment using the multiple security-related techniques, such as filtering, authentication, and encryption. This 'Compartmentalized' framework provides a better depth of network defenes and additional flexibility to our 'Quarantine Model'. This memo enumerates requirements and issues for this architecture. However, it is beyond the scope of this document to propose specific implementations or protocols.</description>
