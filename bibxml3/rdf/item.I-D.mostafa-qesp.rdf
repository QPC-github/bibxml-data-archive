    <title>"QoS-friendly Encapsulating Security Payload (Q-ESP)", Mahmoud Mostafa, Anas Abou El Kalam, Christian Fraboul</title>

    <description>This document describes a new IPSec protocol called QoS-friendly Encapsulating Security Payload (Q-ESP).  Q-ESP provides confidentiality, data origin authentication, anti-reply, connection less integrity, and facilitates QoS active admission control. The currently implemented IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol is not QoS friendly as it encrypts the upper layer transmission protocol and prevents network control devices such as routers and switches from utilizing this information in performing classification appropriately. In this document we provide the specification of Q-ESP which gives the same security services provided by ESP, in addition to strong source and destination addresses authentication and its ability to facilitate QoS classification.</description>
