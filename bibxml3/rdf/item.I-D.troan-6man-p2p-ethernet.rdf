    <title>"IP Point to Point Ethernet subnet model", Ole Troan</title>

    <description>Ethernet topology is no longer a shared medium.  It is a long time since Ethernet has been a thick yellow cable snaking its way from station to station.  Ethernet is now effectively deployed in a hub and spoke topology.  With a point to point link between a host and the network device.  This memo describes a set of simplications for how to run IP over such links, where the physical topology is exposed in the network layer topology.</description>
