    <description>This document defines capabilities and operations for providing asynchronous message notification delivery for notifications defined using YANG.  Notification delivery can occur over a variety of protocols used commonly in conjunction with YANG, such as NETCONF and Restconf.  The capabilities and operations defined in this document along with their mapping onto NETCONF transport (to be specified in a separate document, but still included in the current document version) are intended to obsolete RFC 5277.</description>
