    <description>This memo describes a family of deterministically generated Nothing Up My Sleeve (NUMS) elliptic curves over prime fields offering high practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates.  The domain parameters are defined for both classical Weierstrass curves, for compatibility with existing applications, and modern twisted Edwards curves, allowing further efficiency improvements for a given security level.</description>
