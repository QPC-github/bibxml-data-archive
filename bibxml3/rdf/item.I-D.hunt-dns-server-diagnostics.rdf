    <description>The widespread adoption of DNSSEC implies more frequent DNSSEC failures.  Unfortunately, DNSSEC's failure mode is largely opaque to the client: when validation fails, the only signal that the clients of a validating resolver receive is an empty response with a SERVFAIL response code.  This note proposes a protocol extension to allow SERVFAIL responses to include additional diagnostic information, giving the client greater insight into what went wrong and a better chance of delivering useful problem reports to DNS operators.</description>
