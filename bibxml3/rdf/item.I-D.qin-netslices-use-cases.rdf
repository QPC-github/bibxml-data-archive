    <description>Network Slicing (NS) is widely discussed and considered in 5G communities and standard organizations as a key mechanism to meet diverse service requirements concurrently with the same physical network infrastructure.  NS enables the operator to provide isolated platform for service verticals, and deploy new services without causing or experiencing any disruption to other already deployed services in the same physical network infrastructure.  This document describes the typical use cases that could benefit from network slicing, to support each case, the corresponding requirements on 5G transport network will be analyzed.</description>
