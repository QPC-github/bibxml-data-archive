    <description>This document describes a YANG data model for traffic steering policies in Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios. The policy model is a specific data model for traffic steering using VPN technology. It helps the service management in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model the policy (a set of constraints and rules) that defines how a VPN service is monitored and managed during its lifecycle. Two traffic steering applications have been provided such as traffic optimization with pass or bypass specific nodes or sites.</description>
