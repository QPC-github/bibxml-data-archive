    <description>This document defines two optional extensions to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP): the Repeat option and the Request-Tag option.  Each of these options when integrity protected, such as with DTLS or OSCOAP, protects against certain attacks on CoAP message exchanges.  The Repeat option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness of a request by requiring the CoAP client to make another request and include a server-provided challenge.  The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server to match message fragments belonging to the same request message, fragmented using the CoAP Block-Wise Transfer mechanism.  This document also specifies additional processing requirements on Block1 and Block2 options.</description>
