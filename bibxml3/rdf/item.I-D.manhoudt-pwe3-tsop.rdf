    <description>This document describes the Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet (TSoP) mechanism to encapsulate Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) bit-streams in a packet format, suitable for Pseudowire (PW) transport over a packet switched network (PSN).  The key property of the TSoP  method is that it transports the SDH/SONET client signal in its entirety through the PW, i.e., no use is made of any specific characteristic of the SONET/SDH signal format, other than its bit rate.  The TSoP transparency includes transporting the timing properties of the SDH/SONET client signal. This ensures a maximum of transparency and a minimum of complexity, both in implementation and during operation.</description>
