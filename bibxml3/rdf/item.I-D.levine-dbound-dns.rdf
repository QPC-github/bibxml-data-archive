    <title>"Publishing Organization Boundaries in the DNS", John Levine</title>

    <description>The organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is often different from the one that manages the tree above it.  We describe an architecture to publish in the DNS the boundaries between organizations that can be adapted to various policy models and can be queried with a small number of DNS lookups.</description>
