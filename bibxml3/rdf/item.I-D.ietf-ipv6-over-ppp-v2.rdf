    <description>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of encapsulating Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point links. PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document defines the method for sending IPv6 packets over PPP links, the NCP for establishing and configuring the IPv6 over PPP and the method for forming IPv6 link-local addresses on PPP links. It also specifies the conditions for performing Duplicate Address Detection on IPv6 global unicast addresses configured for PPP links either through stateful or stateless address autoconfiguration. This document obsoletes RFC 2472.</description>
