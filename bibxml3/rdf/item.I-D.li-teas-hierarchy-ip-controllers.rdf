        <description>This document describes the interactions between various IP controllers in a hierarchical fashion to provide various IP services. It describes how the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) framework is applied to the Hierarchy of IP controllers (HIC) as well as document the interactions with other protocols like BGP, Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to provide end to end dynamic services spanning multiple domains and controllers (e.g.  Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN), Seamless MPLS etc).</description>
