    <title>"Local Forwarding in Proxy Mobile IPv6", Rajeev Koodli, Kuntal Chowdhury</title>

    <description>With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communication between any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA).  This is the case even when the communicating Mobile Nodes are attached to the same Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG). This document introduces two messages between the LMA and the MAG enabling local forwarding by the MAG.  Such forwarding avoids the delay due to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic load on the LMA.</description>
