    <title>"Interface to Network Security Functions Demo Outline Design", Yuming Xie, Liang Xia, Jun Wu</title>

    <description>This document describes the outline design of an Interface to network Security Functions (I2NSF) demo, aim to enhance understanding of the I2NSF architecture and justify its feasibility. The I2NSF demo enables the interaction between I2NSF client, I2NSF controller and NSF/vNSF by using NETCONF protocol and YANG model. The advantage of it is to ensure that such demo outline design will be able to share and reuse consensually designed functions, thereby increasing interoperability.</description>
