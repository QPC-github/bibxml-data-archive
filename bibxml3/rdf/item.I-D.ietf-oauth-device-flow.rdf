    <title>"OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant", William Denniss, John Bradley, Michael Jones, Hannes Tschofenig</title>

    <description>The OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant is designed for internet- connected devices that either lack a browser to perform a user-agent based authorization, or are input-constrained to the extent that requiring the user to input text in order to authenticate during the authorization flow is impractical.  It enables OAuth clients on such devices (like smart TVs, media consoles, digital picture frames, and printers) to obtain user authorization to access protected resources without using an on-device user-agent.</description>
