    <title>"A SIP Event Package for Subscribing to Changes to an HTTP Resource", Adam Roach</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-sip-http-subscribe-07.txt</link>
    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is increasingly being used in systems that are tightly coupled with Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) servers for a variety of reasons.  In many of these cases, applications can benefit from being able to discover, in near-real- time, when a specific HTTP resource is created, changed, or deleted. This document proposes a mechanism, based on the SIP events framework, for doing so.</description>
