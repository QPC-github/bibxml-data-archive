    <title>"Providing Minimal-Sized Responses to DNS Queries with QTYPE=ANY", Joe Abley, Ólafur Guðmundsson, Marek Majkowski</title>

    <description>The Domain Name System (DNS) specifies a query type (QTYPE) "ANY". The operator of an authoritative DNS server might choose not to respond to such queries for reasons of local policy, motivated by security, performance or other reasons.  The DNS specification does not include specific guidance for the behaviour of DNS servers or clients in this situation.  This document aims to provide such guidance.</description>
