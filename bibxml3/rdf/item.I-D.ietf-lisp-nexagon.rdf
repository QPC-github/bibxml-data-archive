        <description>Geolocation-Services aggregate raw data uploads from vehicles using edge compute locations and process these uploads generating verified, localized, geospatial detection-channels - used by mobility clients to support crowed-sourced dynamic mapping and driving applications. Geolocation Services are broken to shards (areas) and dynamically mapped to compute locations based on road activity. This dynamics combined with clients IP Anchors dynamics creates coherency, context- switching, geo-privacy, and service continuity key issues. These issues are resolved by dataflow virtualization, communication indirection, between mobility clients and Geolocation Services. LISP overlay network-virtualization, offers a fully distributed dataflow virtualization solution at the edge networking level. LISP as a Geolocation mobility-network is described in this document.</description>
