        <description>This informational document describes the combination of LISP and the H3 geospatial hierarchical grid forming a Geolocation mobility edge network. When vehicles with AI cameras detect objects of interest on the road, they use their GPS to calculate their high-resolution (small) grid-tile position. They then use this tile to calculate the high-resolution tile of the detection, and the low-resolution (big) grid-tile containing it. That big-tile identifier is used to calculate IPv6 LISP endpoint identifier (EID). This EID address is a queue of a Geolocation process consolidating all vehicles uploads from that area. Geolocation processes generate IPv6 channels of all ongoing road situations in their area. Vehicles driving or navigating to an area can subscribe to these channels using LISP multicast registration.</description>
