        <description>Geolocation-Service aggregates data uploaded from vehicles in edge compute locations - processing it to verified, localized, consolidated geospatial detection-channels. Channels' updates are used by mobility clients for crowed-sourced dynamic mapping and driving applications. Geolocation Services are broken to shards (areas), each one delegated dynamically to compute locations per road activity. This dynamics combined with clients' IP Anchor dynamics causes coherency, context- switching, geo-privacy, and service continuity key-issues. Key-issues are resolved using dataflow virtualization, an inline indirection between mobility clients and Geolocation Services. LISP overlay network-virtualization offers a fully distributed dataflow virtualization - at the edge networking level. Geolocation mobility-network based on LISP is described in this informational.</description>
