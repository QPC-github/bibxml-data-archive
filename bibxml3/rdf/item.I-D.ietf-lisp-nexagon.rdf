        <description>Geolocation-Services aggregate data uploads from vehicles using edge compute locations and process them to verified, localized, geospatial detection-channels. Channels' updates are used by mobility clients for crowed-sourced dynamic mapping and driving applications. Geolocation Services are broken to shards (areas) which are mapped dynamically to compute locations per road activity. Services dynamics combined with clients IP Anchors dynamics causes coherency, context- switching, geo-privacy, and service continuity key issues. These issues are resolved using dataflow virtualization, inline indirection between mobility clients and Geolocation Services. LISP overlay network-virtualization, offers a fully distributed dataflow virtualization at the edge networking level. Geolocation mobility-network based on LISP is described in this document.</description>
