    <title>"Registry of Unofficial Extensions to the ISO 4217 Alpha Three Currency Identification Namespace (X-ISO4217-A3)", Walter Stanish</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stanish-x-iso4217-a3-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of identifiers for currencies or currency-like commodities lying outside the traditional scope of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alpha-3 standard, such as digital currencies and commodities, currencies issued by countries (nation- states) with limited international recognition, emerging commodities such as emissions reduction credits, private or commercial currencies, and accounting units for local exchange and trading systems (LETS).  Such codes are already in use; the registry simply codifies their existence.  This document obsoletes draft-stanish-x- iso4217-a3-00.</description>
