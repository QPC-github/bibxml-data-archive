    <description>[I-D.ietf-pce-association-group]introduces and explains a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs.  The grouping can then be used to define associations between a set of LSPs and/or a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviours) and is equally applicable to the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] as well as a stateless PCE [RFC5440].  This document specifies a PCEP extension to bind one or more LSPs into an ECMP Associated Group.</description>
