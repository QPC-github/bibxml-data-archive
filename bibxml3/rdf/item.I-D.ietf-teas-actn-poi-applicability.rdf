        <description>This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and optical internetworking. It identifies the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support this deployment architecture and specific scenarios relevant for Service Providers.  Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each multi-layer (packet over optical) scenario with a specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.</description>
