    <description>The Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) contains a number of XML elements and XML attributes carrying keys and related information. Not all algorithms, however, are able to use all elements and for other algorithm certain information is mandatory.  This lead to the introduction of PSKC algorithm profiles that provide further description about the mandatory and optional information elements and their semantic, including extensions that may be needed.  The main PSKC specification defines two PSKC algorithm profiles, namely "HOTP" and "PIN".  This document extends the initial set and specifies nine further algorithm profiles for PKSC.</description>
