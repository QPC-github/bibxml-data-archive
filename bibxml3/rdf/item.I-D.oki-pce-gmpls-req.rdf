    <title>"Requirements for Path Computation Element in GMPLS and IP/MPLS Networks", Eiji Oki</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-oki-pce-gmpls-req-02.txt</link>
    <description>Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of traffic engineering in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and IP/MPLS net- works. In IP/MPLS networks, PCE provides MPLS LSP routes with con- straints. In GMPLS networks, PCE provides GMPLS LSP routes and optimal virtual network topology reconfiguration control, and jugdes on whether a new lower-region LSP should be established when a higher-region LSP is requested. PCE also handles interworking between GMPLS and IP/MPLS net- works, both of which will coexist at some point during the migration process.</description>
