    <description>The Simple Path Control Protocol (SPC) defined in this document is a new protocol defined to enable processes external to networks to establish, delete and monitor paths, including lightpaths. The architecture of this protocol establishes a method of providing messages, and procedures that allow such external processes to use those messages to directly request network resources related to path provisioning.</description>
