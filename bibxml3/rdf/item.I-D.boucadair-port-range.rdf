    <title>"IPv4 Connectivity Access in the Context of IPv4 Address Exhaustion: Port Range based IP Architecture", Mohammed Boucadair, Pierre Levis, Gabor Bajko, Teemu Savolainen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-port-range-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo proposes a solution, based on fractional addresses, to face the IPv4 public address exhaustion.  It details the solution and presents a mock-up implementation, with the results of tests that validate the concept.  It also describes architectures and how fractional addresses are used to overcome the IPv4 address shortage. A comparison with the alternative Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) solutions is also elaborated in the document.  The IPv6 variant of this solution is described in a companion draft.</description>
