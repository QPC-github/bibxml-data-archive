    <title>"HTTP/2 Server Push Use Cases", Mike Bishop</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bishop-httpbis-push-cases-00.txt</link>
    <description>HTTP/2 defines the wire mechanics of Server Push.  Though the mechanics of how a pushed resource is delivered are well-specified, the use cases that describe which resources can be pushed, in what states, and for what purpose are not described in HTTP/2.  As a result, support between implementations varies widely.  This document attempts to enumerate interesting scenarios, in hopes that a more concrete taxonomy can assist the community in arriving at a standard set of supported scenarios.</description>
