    <description>As mobile nodes move to new links, they need to resume their communications in a timely fashion. To communicate, IPv6 nodes need to complete router discovery, address auto-configuration, and other tasks. Unfortunately, this depends on prior completion of the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol, introducing a mandatory delay of up to one second. This document discusses where this can be problematic and proposes solutions that can alleviate the problem.</description>
