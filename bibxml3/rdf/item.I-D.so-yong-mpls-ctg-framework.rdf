    <description>This document describes a framework for managing aggregated traffic over a composite link. A composite link consists of a group of non- homogenous links that have the same forward adjacency and can be considered as a single TE link or an IP link used for MPLS. The document primarily focuses on MPLS data plane and control plane traffic over a composite link and composite link advertisement within IGP. MPLS traffic can be set up by either RSVP-TE or LDP signaling. Applicability is described for a single pair of MPLS-capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a set of layer networks connecting MPLS-capable nodes.</description>
