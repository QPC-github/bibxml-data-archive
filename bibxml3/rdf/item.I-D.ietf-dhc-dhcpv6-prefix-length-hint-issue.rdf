    <description>DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (RFC3633) allows a client to include a prefix-length hint value in the IA_PD option to indicate a preference for the size of the prefix to be delegated, but is unclear about how the client and server should act in different situations involving the prefix-length hint.  This document provides a summary of the existing problems with the prefix-length hint and guidance on what the client and server could do in different situations.</description>
