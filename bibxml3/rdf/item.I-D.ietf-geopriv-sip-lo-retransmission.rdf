    <title>"Implications of 'retransmission-allowed' for SIP Location Conveyance", Jon  Peterson, Ted Hardie, John Morris</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-geopriv-sip-lo-retransmission-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document explores an ambiguity in the interpretation of the &lt;retransmission-allowed> element of the Presence Information Data Format for Location Objects (PIDF-LO) in cases where PIDF-LO is conveyed by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  It provides recommendations for how the SIP location conveyance mechanism should adapt to these ambiguities.  Documents standardizing the SIP location conveyance mechanisms will be standards-track documents processed according to the usual SIP process.  This document is intended primarily to provide the SIP working group with a statement of the consensus of the GEOPRIV working group on this topic.  It secondarily provides tutorial information on the problem space for the general reader.</description>
