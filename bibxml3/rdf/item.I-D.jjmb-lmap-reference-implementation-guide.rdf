    <description>This document describes a software architecture and reference implementation guidelines for the framework for Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP).  The IETF-LMAP working group proposed a draft that details a logical architecture for performance measurements in broadband networks on a large scale.  The IETF-LMAP proposal contains the operational concepts for such a platform.  However, since the standardization is in the initial stages with no official existing implementation, the proposal leaves many details of the specification up to the implementer to discover.</description>
