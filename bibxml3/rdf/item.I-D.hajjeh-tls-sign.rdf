    <description>TLS protocol provides authentication and data protection for communication between two entities. However, missing from the protocol is a way to perform non-repudiation service.  This document defines extensions to the TLS protocol to allow it to perform non-repudiation service. It is based on [TLSSIGN] and it provides the client and the server the ability to sign by TLS, handshake and applications data using certificates such as X.509.</description>
