    <title>"Virtual Machine mobility in L3 Networks.", Warren Kumari, Joel Halpern</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wkumari-dcops-l3-vmmobility-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document outlines how Virtual Machine mobility can be accomplished in datacenter networks that are based on L3 technologies.  It is not really intended to solve (or fully define) the problem, but rather to outline it at a very high level to determine if standardization within the IETF makes sense.</description>
