    <description>When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in ASM mode need to pass through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how to accomplish this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label Switches Paths are established using mLDP.  Specification of Requirements</description>
