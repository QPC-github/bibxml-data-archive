    <description>The Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) LIST+ Extension allows a POP3 client to instruct a POP3 server to send additional information with the LIST command response.  It also can instruct a POP3 server to send only information about newly arrived messages, when polling for new messages.  This will help save message round trips and network bandwidth, especially on large mailboxes containing several messages.  On public POP3 servers, serving thousands of mailboxes, and being polled frequently, LIST+ will help reduce server load as well as network bandwith.</description>
