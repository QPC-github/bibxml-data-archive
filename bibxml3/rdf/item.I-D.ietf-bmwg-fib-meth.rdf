    <title>"Methodology for Forwarding Information Base (FIB) based Router Performance", Jeffery Dunn, Cynthia Martin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-bmwg-fib-meth-03.txt</link>
    <description>The forwarding performance of an IP router is highly dependent on the information in its forwarding information base. This document describes the methodology to be used to determine the IP packet forwarding performance of an IP router as a function of the routers ability to properly form and optimize its forwarding information base.</description>
