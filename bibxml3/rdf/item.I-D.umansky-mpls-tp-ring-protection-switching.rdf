    <description>This document describes a mechanism to address the requirements for protection of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSP) in a ring topology. The mechanism defined herein is designed to support point-to-point as well as point-to-multipoint LSPs.  The MPLS-TP section layer OAM is used to monitor the connectivity between each two adjacent nodes using the mechanisms defined in the [MPLS-TP OAM].  The Automatic Protection Switching (APS) protocol is used for coordination of protection switching actions between the ring nodes.</description>
