    <title>"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Hub and Spoke Multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", LiZhong Jin, Frederic JOUNAY, Manav Bhatia</title>

    <description>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) environment, the RSVP-TE based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSP allows traffic to transmit from root to leaf node, but there is no co-routed reverse path for traffic from leaf to root node.  This draft introduces a Hub and Spoke Multipoint (HSMP) LSP, which allows traffic from both the root to the leaves through a P2MP LSP and also the leaves to the root along a co-routed reverse path.</description>
