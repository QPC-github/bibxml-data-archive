    <title>"Session-Specific Explicit Diameter Request Routing", Tina Tsou (Ting ZOU), Glen Zorn, Tom Taylor</title>

    <description>This document describes a mechanism to enable specific Diameter proxies to remain in the path of all message exchanges constituting a Diameter session.  This document is being published to provide the basis for a standardized solution to a problem raised by some architectures (e.g., WLAN 3GPP IP access, 3GPP TS23.234) that use Diameter.  The intended use will be as a reference within the non- IETF specification of a Diameter application that meets the needs of these architectures.</description>
