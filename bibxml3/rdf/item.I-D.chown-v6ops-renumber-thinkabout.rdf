    <title>"Things to think about when Renumbering an IPv6 network", Tim Chown</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chown-v6ops-renumber-thinkabout-05.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a summary of scenarios, issues for consideration and protocol features for IPv6 network renumbering, i.e. achieving the transition from the use of an existing network prefix to a new prefix in an IPv6 network. Its focus lies not in the procedure for renumbering, but as a set of "things to think about" when undertaking such a renumbering exercise.</description>
