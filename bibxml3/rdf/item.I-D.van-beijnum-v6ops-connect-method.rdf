    <title>"IPv4/IPv6 Interoperation Using the HTTP CONNECT Method", Iljitsch van  Beijnum</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-van-beijnum-v6ops-connect-method-00.txt</link>
    <description>As of the deprecation of NAT-PT as a mechanism to allow IPv6-only hosts to connect to IPv4-only hosts, there is no longer a viable way to provide interoperation between IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts connected to the internet. This document outlines a way to use the HTTP CONNECT method (better known as HTTPS proxying) to accomplish this interoperation for a large (but not the full) set of IP applications. The intent is to provide a base level usability for IPv6-only hosts to remove the need to provide IPv4 connectivity in all cases.</description>
