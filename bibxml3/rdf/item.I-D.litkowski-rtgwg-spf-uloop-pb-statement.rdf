    <title>"Link State protocols SPF trigger and delay algorithm impact on IGP microloops", Stephane Litkowski</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-litkowski-rtgwg-spf-uloop-pb-statement-02.txt</link>
    <description>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.  In this document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using different Link State IGP implementations in a single network in regards of microloops.  The analysis is focused on the SPF triggers and SPF delay algorithm.</description>
