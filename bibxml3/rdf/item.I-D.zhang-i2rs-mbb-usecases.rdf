    <description>In a mobile backhaul network, traditional configuration and diagnoses mechanisms based on device-level management tools and manual processing are ill-suited to meet the requirements of today's scalable, flexible, and complex network.  Thanks to the new innovation of Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) programmatic interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], an alternative way is available to control the configuration and diagnose the operational results.  This document discusses the use case for I2RS in mobile backhaul network.</description>
