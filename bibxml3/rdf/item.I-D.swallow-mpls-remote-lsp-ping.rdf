    <description>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprocal Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths. A proxy ping request is sent to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched Path. The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to root tracing.</description>
