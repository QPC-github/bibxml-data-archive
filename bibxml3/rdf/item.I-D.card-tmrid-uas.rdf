    <description>This document is an Applicability Statement for various IETF Technical Specifications, including the Host Identity Protocol (HIPv2) and the Domain Name System (DNS), complementing emerging external standards for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) remote identification (RID).  The objectives are: to facilitate use of existing Internet services to support UAS RID and to enable enhanced RID related services; and to enable verification that UAS RID information is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node).</description>
