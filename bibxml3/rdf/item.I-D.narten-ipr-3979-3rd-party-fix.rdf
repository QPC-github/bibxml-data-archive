    <title>"Clarification of the 3rd Party Disclosure procedure in RFC 3979", Thomas  Narten</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-narten-ipr-3979-3rd-party-fix-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979. Specifically, when 3rd party IPR disclosures are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder that a 3rd party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC3979 rules.</description>
