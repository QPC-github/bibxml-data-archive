    <title>"Utilizing Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) for the Host Identity  Protocol (HIP)", Hannes Tschofenig, Dan Wing</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tschofenig-hip-ice-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology can be used for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) to determine whether end-to-end communication is possible. ICE makes use of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol in addition to mechanisms for checking connectivity between peers. After running the ICE the two HIP end points will be able to communicate directly or through a relay via Network Address Translators (NATs), Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs) and firewalls .</description>
