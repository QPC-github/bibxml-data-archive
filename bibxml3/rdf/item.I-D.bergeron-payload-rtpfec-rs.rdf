    <title>"RTP Payload Format for Reed-Solomon FEC", Roberta Fracchia, Cyril Bergeron, Benjamin Gadat</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bergeron-payload-rtpfec-rs-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new RTP payload type for the insertion of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in RTP. This solution is based on Reed-Solomon codes that protect the transmission both from packet losses and bit errors which may affect the communication over wireless links. These codes are systematic, thus being completely transparent to FEC unaware RTP clients. The new payload defined in this draft and the insertion of RS codes are particularly suited for H.264 video streaming.</description>
