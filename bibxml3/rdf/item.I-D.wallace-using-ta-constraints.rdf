    <title>"Using Trust Anchor Constraints During Certification Path Processing", Sam Ashmore, Carl Wallace</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wallace-using-ta-constraints-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to use information associated with a trust anchor public key when validating certification paths.  This information can be used to constrain the usage of a trust anchor. Typically, constraints are used to limit the certificate policies and names that can appear in certification paths validated using a trust anchor.</description>
