    <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP sessions.  The payload format defines a new media subtype name "H264-SVC", but is still backwards compatible to [I-D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis] since the base layer, when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name ("H264") and the packetization method specified in [I- D.ietf-avt-rtp-rfc3984bis].  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.Table of Contents</description>
