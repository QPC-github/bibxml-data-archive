        <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider tunnel for Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN).  Global Table Multicast [RFC7716] or Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN).  It is possible that not all routers in the provider network support BIER and there are various methods to handle BIER-incapable transit routers. However those methods assume the MVPN/EVPN Provider Edges (PEs) are BIER-capable.  This document specifies a method to allow BIER- incapable routers to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER as the transport, by having the upstream BIER Forwarding Router (BFR) that is connected directly or indirectly via a tunnel to a BIER-incapable PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the PE.</description>
