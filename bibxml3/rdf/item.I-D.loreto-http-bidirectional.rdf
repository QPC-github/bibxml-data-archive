    <description>On today's Internet, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is often used (some would say abused) to enable asynchronous, "server- initiated" communication from a server to a client as well as from a client to a server.  This document describes known issues and best practices related to such "bidirectional HTTP" applications, focusing on the two most common mechanisms: "HTTP long polling" and "HTTP streaming".</description>
