    <title>"A RADIUS Attribute, Binding, Profiles, Name Identifier Format, and Confirmation Methods for SAML", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman, Alejandro Perez-Mendez</title>

    <description>This document describes the use of the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) with RADIUS in the context of the ABFAB architecture. It defines two RADIUS attributes, a SAML binding, a SAML name identifier format, two SAML profiles, and two SAML confirmation methods.  The RADIUS attributes permit encapsulation of SAML assertions and protocol messages within RADIUS, allowing SAML entities to communicate using the binding.  The two profiles describe the application of this binding for ABFAB authentication and assertion query/request, enabling a Relying Party to request authentication of, or assertions for, users or machines (Clients). These Clients may be named using a NAI name identifier format. Finally, the subject confirmation methods allow requests and queries to be issued for a previously authenticated user or machine without needing to explicitly identify them as the subject.  The use of the artifacts defined in this document is not exclusive to ABFAB.  They can be applied in any AAA scenario, such as the network access control.</description>
