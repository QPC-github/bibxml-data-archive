    <description>Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems. Updates to this data requires transporting of the entire XML instance document between hosts, unless there's a mechanism that allows transmitting only the changes of XML documents.
