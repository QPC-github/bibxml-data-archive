    <description>It is getting popular to running data applications over general purpose hardware/chipsets, instead of customized and dedicated hardware/chipset.  This way further decouples the software functions from the hardware.  But moving data processing intensive applications to general purpose hardware is still challenging, although the industry has supplied some proprietary solutions.  This document discusses the problems of data plane acceleration and proposes its framework.</description>
