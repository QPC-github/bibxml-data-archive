    <description>As an optical signal progresses along its path, it may be altered by the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it encounters. When such alterations result in signal degradation, these processes are usually referred to as "impairments". These physical characteristics may be important constraints to consider when using a GMPLS control plane to support path setup and maintenance in wavelength switched optical networks.  This document provides a framework for applying GMPLS protocols and the PCE architecture to support Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength switched optical networks. Specifically, this document discusses key computing constraints, scenarios and architectural processes: Routing, Wavelength Assignment, and Impairment Validation. This document does not define optical data plane aspects; impairment parameters, measurement of, or assessment and qualification of a route, but rather it describes the architectural and information components for protocol solutions.</description>
