    <description>The host configuration protocol DHCPv6 [RFC3315] relies on link-local addresses as source addresses and multicast addresses for destination addresses.  However, some tunnel links (e.g., 6rd [RFC5969] ) do not have IPv6 link-local addresses and do not support IPv6 multicast addresses.  Taking 6rd as an example, this document specifies how DHCPv6 is used across such tunnel links.</description>
