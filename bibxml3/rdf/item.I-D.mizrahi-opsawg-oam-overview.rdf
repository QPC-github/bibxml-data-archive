OAM mechanisms have been defined for various layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety of protocols.  This document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have been defined and are currently being defined by the IETF, as well as a comparison to other OAM mechanisms that have been defined by the IEEE and ITU-T.</description>
