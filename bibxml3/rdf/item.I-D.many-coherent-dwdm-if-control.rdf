    <description>Modulated optical interfaces with coherent detection receivers are in widespread use in Internet networking equipment.  Various implementations are in deployment since 2012 but there is no standard available defining those interfaces, nor their capabilities.  This document identifies the need for work on control plane aspects pre- standard coherent optical DWDM applications.</description>
