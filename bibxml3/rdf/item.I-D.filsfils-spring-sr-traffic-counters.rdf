        <description>Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer a packet flow along any path.  Intermediate per-flow states are eliminated thanks to source routing.  Traffic accounting plays a critical role in network operation.  A traffic account solution is required for SR networks that provides the necessary functionality without creating any additional per SR path states in the fabric.  This document describes counters for traffic accounting in SR networks.</description>
