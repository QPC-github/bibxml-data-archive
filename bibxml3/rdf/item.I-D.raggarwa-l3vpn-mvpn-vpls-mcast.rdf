    <title>"Multicast in BGP/MPLS VPNs and VPLS", Rahul Aggarwal</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-mvpn-vpls-mcast-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a solution framework for overcoming the limitations of existing Multicast VPN (MVPN) and VPLS multicast solutions. It describes procedures for enhancing the scalability of multicast for BGP/MPLS VPNs. It also describes procedures for VPLS multicast that utilize multicast trees in the sevice provider (SP) network. The procedures described here reduce the overhead of PIM neighbor relationships that a PE router needs to maintain for BGP/MPLS VPNs. They also reduce the state (and the overhead of maintaining the state) in the SP network by removing the need to maintain in the SP network at least one dedicated multicast tree per each VPN.</description>
