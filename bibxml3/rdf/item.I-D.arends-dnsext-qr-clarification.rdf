    <description>This document clarifies DNS response message interpretation to avoid denial of service attacks using DNS responses. In a recent DNS software assessment it has come to light that some implementations respond to DNS response messages. A loop occurs if the receiver of this response responds with a response. It was never explicitly stated that response messages must not be answered. This draft makes the statement explicit.</description>
