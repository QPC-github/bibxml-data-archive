    <description>BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a variant of BIER [RFC8279] to support explicit path engineering.  BIER-TE defines a (loose) source routed multicast forwarding method where every hop and destination in the TE path is identified via bits in the bitstring of the BIER header in the data packets.  BIER-TE forwarding architecture is described in [I-D.draft- ietf-bier-te-arch].  Control framework for Traffic Engineering with BIER-TE forwarding plane is explained in [I-D.draft-eckert-teas-bier- te-framework].  This document describes the OSPF [RFC2328] protocol extension required for BIER-TE control framework with MPLS encapsulation [RFC8296].  Support for other encapsulation types is outside the scope of this document.  The use of multiple encapsulation types is outside the scope of this document.</description>
