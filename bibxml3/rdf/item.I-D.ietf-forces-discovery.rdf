    <description>This document describes a mechanism for discovering inter-FE topology, topology maintenance in Intra-NE. Such a mechanism is essential for all these elements in the set to behave as a single Network Element, as required by the ForCES architecture as well as to perform certain optimizations at the FE by making use of the topology. The mechanism only operates during post-association phase of ForCES protocol.</description>
