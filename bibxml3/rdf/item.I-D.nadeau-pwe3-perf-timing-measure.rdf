    <title>"Pseudowire Performance and Timing Measurement", Thomas Nadeau, Yakov Stein</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nadeau-pwe3-perf-timing-measure-00.txt</link>
    <description>To-date, no intrinsic mechanisms exist for pseudowires that allow operators to measure the performance of a pseudowire. Only the existing Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification protocol allows for the verification of connectivity of a pseudowire. This document defines the problems that must be solved in this space, and provides discussion points around the issues of pseudowire performance measurement, including timing synchronization and packet loss detection.</description>
