    <description>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized metrics for measuring end-to-end performance between 2 points. This memo defines 2 sets of metrics to extend these end-to-end ones. It defines spatial metrics for measuring the performance of segments along a path and metrics for measuring the performance of a group of users in multiparty communications.</description>
