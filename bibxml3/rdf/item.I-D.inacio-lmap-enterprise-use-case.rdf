    <description>The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large- scale networks.  The use case will describe how very large enterprise networks are not very different from the networks considered by other LMAP use cases and that most measurements are useful to both use cases.  In addition this use case will state the need for the ability to have finer grained observation related to User Experience potentially on a per application basis.</description>
