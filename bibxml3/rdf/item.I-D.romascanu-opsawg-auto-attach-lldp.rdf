    <description>Automatic attachment or auto-attach is a procedure that allows for the automatic connection of network objects (e.g. end stations, network devices, sensors, automation elements) to a core network based on the individual services that are run or configured on the objects, and the mapping of the services to the managed paths in the network.  This document describes an implementation of the auto-attach concept based on the IEEE802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) which is used to automatically attach network devices not supporting the IEEE 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) to individual services in an IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network.</description>
