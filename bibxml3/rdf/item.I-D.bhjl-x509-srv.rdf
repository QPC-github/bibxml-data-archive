    <title>"Using a DNS SRV Record to Locate an X.509 Certificate Store", Brian Haberman, John Levine</title>

    <description>This document describes a method to allow parties to locate X.509 certificate stores with Domain Name System Service records in order to retrieve certificates and certificate revocation lists.  The primary purpose of such retrievals is to facilitate the association of X.509 and PGP public keys with e-mail addresses to allow for encrypted e-mail exchanges.</description>
