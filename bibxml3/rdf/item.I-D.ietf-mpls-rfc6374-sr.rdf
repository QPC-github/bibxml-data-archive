        <description>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation in MPLS networks.  This document utilizes these mechanisms for Performance Delay and Loss Measurements in SR networks with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS), for both SR-MPLS links and end-to-end SR-MPLS paths including Policies.  In addition, this document defines Return Path TLV and Block Number TLV extensions for RFC 6374.</description>
