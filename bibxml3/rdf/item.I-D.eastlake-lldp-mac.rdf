    <title>"MAC Address for Layer 3 Link Local Discovery Protocol (LLDP)", Donald Eastlake</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-eastlake-lldp-mac-00.txt</link>
    <description>IEEE 802 has defined a number of protocols which operate between adjacent Ethernet stations at Layer 2, including bridges, such as the Link Layer Discover Protocol (IEEE 802.1AB, LLDP). LLDP and other such protocols may be useful between Layer 3 aware stations such as IP routers and hosts. This document specifies a MAC address that can be used for this purpose despite intervening bridges.</description>
