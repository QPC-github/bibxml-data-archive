    <description>Meeting the agreed service quality in a mobile ad hoc network is tough and addressed in [RFC1677]. A mechanism is provided in [RFC2501]. In this draft, usage of an integrated algorithm is described. The fading RF channels introduce the harmful self-similarity in to the traffic. To counter the same, another self-similar controlling mechanism may be inserted for the better wireless network performance and optimal resource utilization.</description>
