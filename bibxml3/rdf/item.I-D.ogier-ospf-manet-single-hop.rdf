    <title>"Use of OSPF-MDR in Single-Hop Broadcast Networks", Richard Ogier</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ogier-ospf-manet-single-hop-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single- hop broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single- hop networks.</description>
