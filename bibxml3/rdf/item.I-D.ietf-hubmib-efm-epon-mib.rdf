    <description>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing interfaces that conform to the Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) standard as defined in the IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004, which are extended capabilities to the Ethernet like interfaces.</description>
