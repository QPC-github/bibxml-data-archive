    <description>This document describes problem statements for realizing an end-to- end network slicing that is expected to provide service-oriented communications between users and applications.  3GPP introduced the network slicing concept in the 5G architecture (3GPP Release 15), however, it mainly focuses on mobile access and core domains.  In order to reap the benefit of the concept, a network slicing needs to be designed across multiple domains of the network including non-3GPP parts.  This document analyzes the current 3GPP 5G network slicing architecture and summarizes problem statements for the interworking between the 5G network slicing and the transport network.</description>
