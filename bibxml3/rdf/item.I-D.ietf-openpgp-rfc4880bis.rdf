    <description>{ Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from RFC4880 }  This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP.  OpenPGP provides encryption with public-key or symmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital signatures, compression and key management.  This document is maintained in order to publish all necessary information needed to develop interoperable applications based on the OpenPGP format.  It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an application.  It describes only the format and methods needed to read, check, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network.  It does not deal with storage and implementation questions. It does, however, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security flaws.</description>
