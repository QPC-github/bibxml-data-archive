    <description>The process by which the members of the IAB and IESG, some Trustees of the IETF Trust, and some Directors of the IETF LLC are selected, confirmed, and recalled is specified in this document.  This document is based on RFC7437.  Only those updates required to reflect the changes introduced by IASA 2.0 have been included.  Any other changes will be addressed in future documents.  This document obsoletes RFC7437 and RFC8318.</description>
