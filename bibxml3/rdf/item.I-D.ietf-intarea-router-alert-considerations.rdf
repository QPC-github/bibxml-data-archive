    <description>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet. Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery (MRD) and General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols that make use of the IP Router Alert Option.  This document discusses security aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option thereby updating RFC2113 and RFC2711. Specifically, it provides recommendation against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet as well as identify controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used safely.  It also provides recommendation about protection approaches for Service Providers.  Finally it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.</description>
