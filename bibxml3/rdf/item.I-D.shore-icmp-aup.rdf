    <title>"An Acceptable Use Policy for New ICMP Types and Codes", Melinda Shore, Carlos Pignataro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shore-icmp-aup-12.txt</link>
    <description>In this document we provide a basic description of ICMP's role in the IP stack and some guidelines for future use.  This document is motivated by concerns about lack of clarity concerning when to add new Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types and/or codes.  These concerns have highlighted a need to describe policies for when adding new features to ICMP is desirable and when it is not.</description>
