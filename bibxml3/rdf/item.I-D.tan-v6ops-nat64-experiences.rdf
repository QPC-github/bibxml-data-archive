    <description>This document discusses our experiences from deploying NAT64 devices for various Internet applications.  Before the final transition to an IPv6-only network, NAT64 is one of the possible technologies which may be used to give users access to the IPv4-only parts of the Internet via an IPv6-only network.  This document analyzes the testing results for a number of popular applications and describes the problems to be solved in the period of transition from IPv4 to IPv6.</description>
