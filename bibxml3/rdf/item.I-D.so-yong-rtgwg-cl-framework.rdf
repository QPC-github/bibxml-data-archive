    <title>"Composite Link Framework in Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)", So Ning, Dave McDysan, Eric Osborne, Lucy Yong, Curtis Villamizar</title>

    <description>This document specifies a framework for support of composite link in MPLS networks.  A composite link consists of a group of homogenous or non-homogenous links that have the same forward adjacency and can be considered as a single TE link or an IP link in routing.  A composite link relies on its component links to carry the traffic over the composite link.  Applicability is described for a single pair of MPLS-capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a set of layer networks connecting MPLS-capable nodes.</description>
