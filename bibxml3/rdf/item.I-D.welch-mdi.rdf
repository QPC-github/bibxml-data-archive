    <title>"A Proposed Media Delivery Index", James Welch, James Clark</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-welch-mdi-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines a Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement which can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended to deliver applications such as streaming media MPEG video and Voice over IP or other arrival time and packet loss sensitive information. It provides an indication of traffic jitter, a measure of deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data loss at-a- glance measure for a particular flow. For instance, the MDI may be used as a reference in characterizing and comparing networks carrying UDP streaming media. The Media Delivery Index measurement defined in this memo is intended for Information only.</description>
