    <title>"Topology-based aggregation", Pedro Marques, Russ White</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-marques-idr-aggregate-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a mechanism which allows more-specific IP address prefixes to be aggregated when they are topologically equivalent or less preferable than a less-specific advertisement.  It is designed to allow multi-homed sites to use "Provider Aggregatable" (PA) addresses and obtain both redundancy and local traffic optimizations when using multiple service providers.</description>
