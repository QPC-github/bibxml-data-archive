    <description>The ALTO Service allows applications to obtain network information for optimizing their traffic.  An ALTO server maintains ALTO data and provides ALTO services to its clients.  In a big network, a single ALTO server could a bottleneck in performance.  To increase the scalability of ALTO, this document proposes a hierarchical architecture for ALTO.  This architecture allows collecting ALTO information and/or providing ALTO services in a distributed manner. An ISP can deploy multiple ALTO servers in a hierarchical architecture to improve scalability.</description>
