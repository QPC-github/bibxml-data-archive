    <title>"Considerations for IPv6 Address Selection Policy Changes", Tim Chown</title>

    <description>Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication is multi-addressed, a mechanism is required for the initiating node to select the most appropriate address pair for the communication.  RFC 3484 (IPv6 Default Address Selection) [RFC3484] defines such a mechanism for nodes to perform source and destination address selection.  While RFC3484 recognised the need for implementations to be able to change the policy table, it did not define how this could be achieved.  Requirements have now emerged for administrators to be able to dynamically change the RFC 3484 policy tables from a central control point, and for nomadic hosts to be able to obtain the policy for the network that they are currently attached to without manual user intervention.  This text discusses considerations for such policy changes, including examples of cases where a change of policy is required, and the likely frequency of such policy changes.  This text also includes some discussion on the need to also update RFC 3484, where default policies are currently defined.</description>
