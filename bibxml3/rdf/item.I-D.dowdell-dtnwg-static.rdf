    <title>"Static Routing for DTN", John Dowdell, Nabil Benamar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dowdell-dtnwg-static-00.txt</link>
    <description>Static Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks cannot make full use of standard IPv4 or IPv6 static routing as defined in section 7.4 of [RFC1812], due to the DTN feature of Late Binding where the IP address or addresses associated with an Endpoint Identifier may not be known when a packet is originated.  This draft presents a specification for static routing in the DTN environment.</description>
