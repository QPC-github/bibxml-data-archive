    <description>SIPREC is capable of recording interactive text media that is transmitted via RTP.  However that format is not commonly used for message or chat scenarios.  There is also a need for recording text media carried via MSRP.  One case of note is exchange of text between hearing-impaired users and emergence service bureaus.  Also, recording support is needed for MSRP used in chat conferences and multimedia conferences.  This document describes how to achieve MSRP channel recording within the mechanism of SIP Recording (SIPREC).</description>
