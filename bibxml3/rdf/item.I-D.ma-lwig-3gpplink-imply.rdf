    <description>In 3GPP Release 12, the work item Machine Type Communication (MTC) is specifying low cost terminals for Machine to Machine communications. Since IETF has already developed a suite of protocols for device communication, it is useful to analyze the limitation of 3GPP MTC and the impact on the implementation of IETF protocol suite.  This document analyzes the feature of 3GPP MTC and the impact on light weight protocol implementation for the MTC terminals.</description>
