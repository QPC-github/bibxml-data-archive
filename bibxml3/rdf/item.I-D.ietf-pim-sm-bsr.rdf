    <title>"Bootstrap Router (BSR) Mechanism for PIM", Nidhi Bhaskar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pim-sm-bsr-12.ps</link>
    <description>This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the class of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) family that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to discover the sources that send to a particular multicast group. BSR is one way that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in order to function. The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust to router failure.</description>
