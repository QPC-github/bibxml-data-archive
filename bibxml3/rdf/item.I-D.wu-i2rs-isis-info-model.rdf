    <description>IS-IS is a widely deployed link-state protocol in routing networks. During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained through typical CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  With the expansion and complication of modern networks, the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has been increased.  The I2RS is a standard-based interface which provides a programmatic way to achieve this goal.  This document specifies an information model for the IS-IS protocol to facilitate the definition of a standardized data model, which can be used to define interfaces to the IS-IS from an entity that may even be external to the routing system.  Based on standardized data model and interfaces, use cases of IGP protocols defined by I2RS-WG can be supported.</description>
