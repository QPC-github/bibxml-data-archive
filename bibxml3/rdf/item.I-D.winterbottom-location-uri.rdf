    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-winterbottom-location-uri-01.txt</link>
    <description>An analysis is performed on the advantages and disadvantages for provision of Location Information (LI) by-reference in the GEOPRIV architecture. The concept of a Location URI, that is, a URI that references LI, is introduced. A number of usage patterns for Location URIs are discussed, particularly with regard to addressing mobility. Security concerns that are introduced by Location URIs are also considered.</description>
