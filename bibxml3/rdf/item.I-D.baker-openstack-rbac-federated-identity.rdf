    <title>"Federated Identity for IPv6 Role-base Access Control", Fred Baker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baker-openstack-rbac-federated-identity-00.txt</link>
    <description>This note describes an IPv6 option intended to carry a Federated Identity for use in Role-Based Access Control.  Rather than identify a person, it identifies a group of systems that the sender is a member of.  Role-Based Access Control permits specified sets of systems to communicate with other specified sets of systems, with the intention of scalability.</description>
