    <title>"Connection Reuse in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Vijay Gurbani, Rohan Mahy, Brett Tate</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-connect-reuse-14.txt</link>
    <description>This document enables a pair of communicating proxies to reuse a congestion-controlled connection between themselves for sending requests in the forward and backwards direction.  Because the connection is essentially aliased for requests going in the backwards direction, reuse is predicated upon both the communicating endpoints authenticating themselves using X.509 certificates through TLS.  For this reason, we only consider connection reuse for TLS over TCP and TLS over SCTP.  This document also provides guidelines on connection reuse and virtual SIP servers and the interaction of connection reuse and DNS SRV lookups in SIP.</description>
