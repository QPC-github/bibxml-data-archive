    <description>This memo defines a Yang model related to the Optical Transceiver parameters characterising coherent 100G and above interfaces.  100G and above Transceivers support coherent modulation, multiple modulation formats, multiple FEC codes including some not yet specified (or by in phase of specification by) ITU-T G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] or any other ITU-T recommendation.  More context about the state of the Coherent transceivers is described in draft-many- coherent-DWDM-if-control.  Use cases are described in RFC7698  The Yang model defined in this memo can be used for Optical Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of a multi-vendor IaDI optical link.  The use of this model does not guarantee interworking of transceivers over a DWDM.  Optical path feasibility and interoperability has to be determined by means outside the scope of this document.  The purpose of this model is to program interface parameters to consistently configure the mode of operation of transceivers.</description>
