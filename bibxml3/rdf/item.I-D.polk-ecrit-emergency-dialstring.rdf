    <title>"Using the Session Initiation Protocol REGISTER Method To Obtain an Emergency  Dialstring", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-ecrit-emergency-dialstring-00.txt</link>
    <description>Most efforts to address emergency calling challenges over IP (and cellular technologies such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, etc, for that matter) have focused on locating the calling user in order to route the emergency call set-up request to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Little or no effort to date has focused on informing the caller what dialstring sequence they may need to use to initiate a call for emergency help. This document describes how the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REGISTER Request message is used to inform a user of which emergency dialstring (of the 60 known dialstring choices around the world) they should use, for where they are geographically.</description>
