    <title>"MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Test Session Control", Dan Frost, Stewart Bryant</title>

    <description>RFC 6374 defines procedures for packet loss and throughput measurement in MPLS networks.  Some forms of measurement rely on the existence of a stream of test messages that flows between measurement points, from which the loss and throughput characteristics of the underlying data channel are inferred.  This document presents procedures for the establishment and maintenance of such test sessions.</description>
