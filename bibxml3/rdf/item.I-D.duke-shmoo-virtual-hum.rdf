    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duke-shmoo-virtual-hum-00.txt</link>
    <description>This is the specification for a virtual humming tool to emulate as closely as possible the audible hums used in-person meetings to help judge consensus.  This specification is based on feedback provided in the survey about virtual humming as well as lived experience with in- person hums.</description>
