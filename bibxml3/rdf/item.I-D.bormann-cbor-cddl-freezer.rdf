        <description>In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some features have turned up that would be nice to have.  In the interest of completing this specification in a timely manner, the present document was started to collect nice-to-have features that did not make it into the first RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610.  It is now time to discuss thawing some of the concepts discussed here.  A number of additional proposals have been added.</description>
