    <description>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technique whereby a device, known as an RFID 'reader', can remotely sense the presence of, and access embedded memory on, a transponder known as a 'tag'. Tags may be affixed to objects as a means of tracking the location and movement of said objects within facilities equipped with RFID readers. Typically, readers communicate with upstream devices, in this document referred to as 'controllers', to receive control commands and upload read tag information. This draft specifies the Simple Lightweight RFID Reader Protocol, or SLRRP (pronounced 'slurp'), to be used to convey configuration, control, status, and tag information between controllers and readers in an IP- based network.</description>
