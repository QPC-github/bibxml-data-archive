    <description>This document describes a new EVPN VPWS service type specifically for multiplexing multiple attachment circuits across different Ethernet Segments and physical interfaces into a single EVPN VPWS service tunnel and still providing Single-Active and All-Active multi-homing. This new service is referred to as flexible cross-connect service. It also describes the rational for this new service type as well as a solution to deliver such service.</description>
