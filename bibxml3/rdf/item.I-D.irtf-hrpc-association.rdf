        <description>This document discusses the relationships between the Internet architecture and the ability of people to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and the right to association online.  The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships, and our ability to exercise our human rights.  As a global assemblage, the Internet provides a public space, yet it is predominantly built on private infrastructure.  Since Internet protocols and architecture play a central role in the management, development, and use of the Internet, we analyze the relation between protocols, architecture, and the rights to assemble and associate to mitigate infringements on those rights.</description>
