        <description>S/MIME version 3.1 has introduced a feasible standardized option to accomplish Header Protection.  However, few implementations generate messages using this structure, and several legacy and non-legacy implementations have revealed rendering issues at the receiving side. Clearer specifications regarding message processing, particularly with respect to header sections, are needed in order to resolve these rendering issues.  Some mail user agents are also sending and receiving cryptographically-protected message headers using a different structure.  In order to help implementers to correctly compose and render email messages with Header Protection, this document updates S/MIME Header Protection specifications with additional guidance on MIME format, sender and receiver processing.</description>
