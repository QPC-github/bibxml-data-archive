        <description>BIER is a scalable multicast overlay [RFC8279] that utilizes a routing underlay, e.g., IP, to build up its Bit Index Forwarding Tables (BIFTs).  This document proposes Fast Reroute Extensions for BIER (BIER-FRR).  It protects BIER traffic after detecting the failure of a link or node in the core of a BIER domain until affected BIFT entries are recomputed after reconvergence of the routing underlay.  The BIER-FRR extensions are applied locally at the point of local repair (PLR) and do not introduce any per-flow state.  The document specifies nomenclature for BIER-FRR and gives examples for its integration in BIER forwarding.  Furthermore, it presents operation modes for BIER-FRR.  Link and node protection may be chosen as protection level.  Moreover, the backup strategies tunnel-based BIER-FRR and LFA-based BIER-FRR are defined and compared.</description>
