    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mitchell-idr-as-private-reservation-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) that are for private use only and should not be advertised to the Internet, known as private use ASNs.  This document enlarges the total space available for private use ASNs by documenting the reservation of a second, larger range and updates RFC 1930.</description>
