    <title>"Design Principles of a Unified Address Format for 4v6", Gang Chen, Zhen Cao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-softwire-4v6-add-format-00.txt</link>
    <description>There are heated discussion over the unified address format and mapping algorithm.  In order to converge the solutions, it is desirable to discuss the requirements and principles for the design. This document tries to propose practical principles for 4v6 deployment.  The requirements have been derived from this deployment consideration.  Based on that, a unified address format has been proposed for easying 4v6 solution implementation .</description>
