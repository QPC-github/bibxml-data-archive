    <title>"Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP", Gerrit Renker, Gorry Fairhurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dccp-tfrc-rtt-option-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an update to the round trip time (RTT) estimation algorithm used for TFRC (TCP Friendly Rate Control) congestion control by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  It updates specifications for the CCID-3 and CCID-4 Congestion Control IDs of DCCP.  The update addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control.  It uses a recommendation made in the original TFRC specification to avoid the inherent problems of receiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the sender.  It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable extension.</description>
