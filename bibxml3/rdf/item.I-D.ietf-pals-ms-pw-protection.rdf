    <description>In MPLS and MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environments, statically provisioned Single-Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection. With statically provisioned Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each segment of the MS-PW is likewise protected from tunnel failures via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  However, static MS- PWs are not protected end-to-end against failure of one of the Switching Provider Edge Routers (S-PEs) along the path of the MS-PW. This document describes how to achieve this protection via redundant MS-PWs by updating the existing procedures in RFC 6870.  It also contains an optional approach based on MPLS-TP Linear Protection.</description>
