    <description>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) using PCEP.  The automatic bandwidth feature allows automatic and dynamic adjustment of the TE LSP bandwidth reservation based on the volume of traffic flowing through the LSP.  This document describes PCEP extensions for automatic bandwidth adjustment when employing an Active Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs.</description>
