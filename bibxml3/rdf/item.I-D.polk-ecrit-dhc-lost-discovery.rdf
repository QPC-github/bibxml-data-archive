    <title>"A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) based Location-to-Service  Translation Protocol (LoST) Discovery Procedure", Henning Schulzrinne</title>

    <description>The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes an XML- based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or civic location information to service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). LoST servers can be located anywhere but a placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network, is desireable. Such a LoST server placement provides benefits in disaster situations with intermittent network connectivity regarding the resiliency of emergency service communication. This document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).</description>
