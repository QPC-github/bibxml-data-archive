    <title>"Proxy Correspondent Node Operation for Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization", Xiangsong Cui, Antti Makela, Pete McCann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cui-mext-route-optimization-cn-proxy-01.txt</link>
    <description>Route Optimization is a useful aspect of Mobile IPv6.  In Route Optimization mode a Mobile Node (MN) can communicate with a Correspondent Node (CN) without the involvement of the MN's home agent.  However, there are some limitations to this feature, including that the Mobile Node and the Correspondent Node must both be capable of Route Optimization.  This document introduces a Route Optimization Proxy function that can be used to enable Route Optimization between an MN and an arbitrary other IP CN - the Route Optimization functions are delegated to the Proxy.  The Route Optimization Proxy function may be implemented in the access router attached to the CN or any other node present on both the path from the MN to the CN and from the HA to the CN, and the Route Optimization Proxy can conduct RO-related signaling and accomplish the Route Optimization procedure on behalf of the Correspondent Node.</description>
