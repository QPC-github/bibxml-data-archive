    <title>"Extensions to the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for  Inter-Layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering", Eiji Oki</title>

    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered service networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering. PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.</description>
