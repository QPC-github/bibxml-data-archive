    <title>"NAT Traversal for dSIP", Eric Cooper</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-matthews-p2psip-dsip-nat-traversal-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document shows how the algorithm for resource registration and lookup in a SIP-based peer-to-peer system can be implemented in the presence of NATs. More precisely, this document show how this algorithm can be generalized into a method of routing arbitrary SIP requests through overlays, and how this approach can be used to set up new connections between peers to use for additional SIP signaling. The document uses SIP to signal new dSIP connections, and uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to allow these connections to be established through NATs.</description>
