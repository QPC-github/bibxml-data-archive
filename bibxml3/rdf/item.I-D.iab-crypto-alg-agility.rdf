    <title>"Guidelines for Cryptographic Algorithm Agility and Selecting Mandatory-to-Implement Algorithms", Russ Housley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-crypto-alg-agility-08.txt</link>
    <description>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication or digital signature. Communicating peers must support a common set of cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate from one mandatory-to-implement algorithm suite to another over time.</description>
