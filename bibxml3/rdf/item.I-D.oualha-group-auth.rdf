    <title>"EAP-based simultaneous re-authentication of a group of nodes", Nouha Oualha, Alexis Olivereau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-oualha-group-auth-00.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet-Draft presents a new scheme that enables the simultaneous re-authentication of a group of nodes in an efficient manner. The Internet-Draft proposes to aggregate the re- authentications of multiple network nodes members of the same group. The scheme is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework, defined in RFC 3748. As an example of operation, a method inspired from EAP-GPSK RFC 5433, is provided.</description>
