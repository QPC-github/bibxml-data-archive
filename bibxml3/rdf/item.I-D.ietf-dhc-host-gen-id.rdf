    <title>"Prefix Assignment in DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-host-gen-id-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces a generic host-oriented prefix assignment mechanism using DHCPv6.  In this new address configuration procedure, the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server to hosts through DHCPv6 message exchanging while the interface identifiers are independently generated by the hosts.  It enables both integral address assignment and self-generated addresses in one single mechanism, DHCPv6.  It also enables stateless address configuration without RA attendance. The technique described in this document can be used in networks which assign IPv6 addresses using DHCPv6, e.g.  WiMAX.</description>
