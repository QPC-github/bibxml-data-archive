    <title>"Procedures for SCTP, TCP, and UDP Port Assignments by IANA", Eliot Lear</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lear-iana-no-more-well-known-ports-02.txt</link>
    <description>Amongst other things the IANA manages port assignments for TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols. This document specifies the procedure by which those assignments take place. The distinction between so-called "well known ports" and other public static assignments is deprecated, the use of SRV records is encouraged, and documentation of port use is strongly encouraged.</description>
