    <description>MAC Addresses are Link Layer addresses used in IEEE Ethernet, WiFi, and other link layer protocols.  A MAC Address is a fixed locally unique address assigned by the Network Interface Card (NIC) manufacturer, though they may be modified by an operating system, and they enable a device to connect to a network.  Due to the static nature of a MAC Address, it raises some privacy concerns that have led to randomization of MAC Addresses by operating systems.  This draft documents the impacts of MAC Address randomization to existing use cases of network and application services and proposes few next steps IETF may consider working on.</description>
