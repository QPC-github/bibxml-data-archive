    <description>This document describes an architecture named "Cloud of Secure Elements (CoSE)" whose goal is to strengthen the Internet trust. A Secure element (SE) provides secure services thanks to various means such as tamper resistant technologies or software virtualization techniques. Secure elements are hosted in dedicated servers (i.e. Trusted Secure Elements Servers, TSES); they provide secure storage facilities or compute cryptographic procedures. Secure elements resources are identified by dedicated URIs and should also support HTTP interface. Users are equipped with "Access Credential" and thanks to the Secure Transport Protocol (STP-TSES) remotely access to Secure Element embedded resources. The RACS (Remote APDU Call Secure) and its associated framework protocol is an early proof of concept of the CoSE concept.</description>
