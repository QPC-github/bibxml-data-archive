    <title>"Extensions for Differentiated Services-aware Traffic Engineered LSPs", Ina  Minei</title>

    <description>This document specifies the extensions necessary to set up multi- class diffserv-aware traffic engineered label switched paths (LSPs). A multi-class diffserv-te LSP carries traffic from multiple traffic classes and is set up along a path that satisfies the bandwidth constraints defined for each of the classes it carries.</description>
