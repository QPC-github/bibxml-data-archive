    <description>RFC7575 defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy used to operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration and manage their lifecycle. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed definition, interface or model of intent.  This document discusses what intent means to different stakeholders, describes different ways to classify intent, and an associated taxonomy of this classification. This is a foundation for discussion intent related topics.</description>
