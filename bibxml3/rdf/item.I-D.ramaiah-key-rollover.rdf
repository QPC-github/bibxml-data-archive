    <title>"Key rollover schemes for TCP connections employing a shared key model.", Anantha Ramaiah</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ramaiah-key-rollover-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes mechanisms to achieve Key rollover for TCP connections that are using the TCP MD5 digest as described in RFC 2385. The mechanisms presented here do not require TCP protocol changes. The mechanisms are not just limited to TCP MD5 digest Key rollover but can be used for any shared Key based TCP security option.</description>
