    <title>"Loose End Message Routing Method for NATFW NSLP", Martin Stiemerling</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stiemerling-nsis-natfw-mrm-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes the use cases and solution for a new NTLP message routing method (MRM) that is used by the NATFW NSLP protocol to locate Network Address Translators (NAT) on the upstream data path. This message routing method is used by NSIS NATFW nodes behind a NAT to allocate a public reachable IP address and/or port number. The current way to do so has been named as "signaling the wrong way" and should be replaced by the proposed message routing method. The scope of this memo is limited to the usage of locating upstream Network Address Translator.</description>
