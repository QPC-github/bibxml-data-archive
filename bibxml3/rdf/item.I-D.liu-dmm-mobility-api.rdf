    <description>In order to provide an appropriate level of mobility support that a mobile node may require for proper performance of various applications, it is important to enable applications to select addresses that will be managed properly by the mobility management infrastructure.  Previous documents have enabled address selection on the basis of certain characteristics such as randomness, temporary usage, scope of validity, and so on.  This document proposes new classes of addresses in addition to those already available, to enable an application to receive certain kinds of mobility support.</description>
