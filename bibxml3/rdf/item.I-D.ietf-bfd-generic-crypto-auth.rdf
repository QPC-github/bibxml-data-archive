    <description>This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) to allow the use of arbitrary cryptographic authentication algorithms in addition to the already-documented authentication schemes described in the base specification.  This document adds the basic infrastructure that is required for supporting algorithm and key agility for BFD.</description>
