    <description>Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible to host various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment. The virtual machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a virtual machine from one hypervisor to another.  However, such a technology is mainly focusing on a migration between hypervisors attached to the same link, and tend not to consider migration over the Internet.  This document mentions the purpose of that type of operation and describe several possible operation methods to provide network portability in cloud systems.</description>
