    <title>"Advanced Unidirectional Route Assessment", Jose Alvarez-Hamelin, Al Morton, Joachim Fabini</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-amf-ippm-route-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo introduces an advanced unidirectional route assessment metric and associated measurement methodology, based on the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330.  This memo updates RFC 2330 in the areas of path-related terminology and path description, primarily to include the possibility of parallel subpaths between a given Source and Destination pair, owing to the presence of multi- path technologies.</description>
