    <title>"How to use URI Resource Records for HTTP", Patrik Faltstrom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-faltstrom-httpbis-dns-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the reasons why it would be a good thing to use SRV [RFC2782] or URI [RFC7553] resource records for HTTP protocol instead of (as of today) just relying on redirects and other mechanisms in the HTTP protocol itself.  It also explains how to do it as there are conflicting instructions on how to do it.</description>
