    <description>ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core- Edge Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problem can tunnel packets from an ITR to an ETR.  EAF involves using 31 bits of the IPv4 header for new purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag, the Fragment Offset field and the Header Checksum field - to carry a 30 bit ETR address.  Consequently, packets in this format need to be handled by routers with upgraded functionality.  EAF is an alternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simpler ITRs and ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, no encapsulation overhead and full compatibility with IPsec AH and Traceroute.  This I-D also briefly explores an alternative to this approach: a new header, of the same length and different, with a different 4 bit Version, to carry 31 bits of ETR address.</description>
