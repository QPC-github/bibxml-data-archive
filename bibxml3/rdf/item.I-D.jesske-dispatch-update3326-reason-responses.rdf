    <title>"Carrying Q.850 Codes in Reason Header Fields in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Responses", Roland Jesske, Laura Liess</title>

    <description>Although the use of the Reason header field in responses is considered in general in RFC3326, its use is not specified for any particular response code.  Nonetheless, existing deployments have been using Reason header fields in responses to carry Q.850 cause codes for failure responses to INVITE requests that have been gatewayed to PSTN systems.  This document normatively describes the use of the Reason header field in SIP responses to carry Q.850 cause codes.</description>
