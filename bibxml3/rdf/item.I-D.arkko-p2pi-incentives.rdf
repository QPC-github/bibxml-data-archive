    <description>Several papers in the May 2008 P2PI workshop have argued that there is a need to build new protocol mechanisms to accommodate peer-to- peer traffic in networks in the most efficient way and with minimal impact to other traffic.  This paper presents an analysis of such solutions from the point of view of the incentives of the different parties involved in peer-to-peer traffic.  The paper concludes that it is essential to understand the incentives in order to have a deployable solution.</description>
