    <description>The Trusted Email Open Standard (TEOS) is a multi-level identity system for SMTP e-mail. It uses signatures to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message, and further permits the secure transmission of assertions about each message including the type of message, third-party certifications, and graphical trust marks.</description>
