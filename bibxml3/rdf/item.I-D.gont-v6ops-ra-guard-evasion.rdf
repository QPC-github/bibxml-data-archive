    <description>The IPv6 Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) mechanism is commonly employed to mitigate attack vectors based on forged ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages.  Many existing IPv6 deployments rely on RA- Guard as the first line of defense against the aforementioned attack vectors.  This document describes possible ways in which current RA- Guard implementations can be circumvented, and discusses possible mitigations.</description>
