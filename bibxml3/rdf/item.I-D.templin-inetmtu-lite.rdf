    <title>"Minimal Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for IP/*/IPv4 Tunnels", Fred  Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-templin-inetmtu-lite-00.txt</link>
    <description>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet has become 1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms impose an encapsulation overhead that can reduce the effective path MTU to smaller values.  Additionally, existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms are limited in their ability to discover and utilize larger MTUs.  This document specifies minimal mechanisms for conveying packets over IP/*/IPv4 tunnels that address these issues.</description>
