    <description>The Multicast Ping Protocol specified in this document allows for checking whether an endpoint can receive multicast, both Source- Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source Multicast (ASM).  It can also be used to obtain additional multicast-related information such as multicast tree setup time.  This protocol is based on an implementation of tools called ssmping and asmping.</description>
