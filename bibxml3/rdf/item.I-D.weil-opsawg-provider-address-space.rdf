    <title>"IANA Reserved IPv4 Prefix for IPv6 Transition", Jason Weil, Victor Kuarsingh, Chris Donley</title>

    <description>This document specifies the use of a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation to support the deployment of IPv6 transition technologies and IPv4 address sharing technologies post IPv4 exhaustion.  Service providers are in the process of implementing IPv6 support by providing dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 services to their end-users.  One method for continued support of the IPv4 Internet post IANA IPv4 depletion is through the use of a carrier-provided NAT444 infrastructure.  Another mechanism used to transition to IPv6 is an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel such as IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6RD).  This document details the use of an IANA reserved address block for these purposes.</description>
