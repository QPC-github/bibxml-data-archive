    <title>"Problem Statement for Dual Stack Moving Internet (DSMI)", Sangjin Jeong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jeong-netlmm-dual-stack-moving-ps-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft discusses the handover problem of dual stack mobile nodes when the mobile nodes roam over IPv4 and IPv6 NETLMM domains. Current NETLMM architecture supports IPv6 only. However, as the NETLMM architecture being more widely used, it will be likely to introduce the NETLMM architecture to IPv4 networks. In this environment, a dual stack mobile node may move to both IPv6 and IPv4 NETLMM domains.</description>
