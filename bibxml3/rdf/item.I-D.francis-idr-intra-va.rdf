    <title>"FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation and Default Routes", Paul Francis, Xiaohu Xu, Hitesh Ballani</title>

    <description>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses the global routing system in a number of ways.  One of the most costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.  FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected RIB entries into the FIB.  This document specifies two styles of FIB suppression.  Edge suppression (ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core- edge topology to shrink the FIBs of their edge routers, including those that interface to other ISPs and exchange the full DFRT. Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any and all routers.  Both styles may be deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</description>
