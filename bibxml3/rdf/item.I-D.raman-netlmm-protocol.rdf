    <title>"A Protocol for Network-based Localized Mobility Management", Vijay Raman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-raman-netlmm-protocol-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document suggests a local mobility solution controlled by the network within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution employs a Proxy Mobile IPv6 client that generates a Proxy Binding Update message. Two variants of the solution are suggested depending on the realization of the Proxy Mobile IP client function. The security association between the network elements for executing the local mobility is also discussed.</description>
