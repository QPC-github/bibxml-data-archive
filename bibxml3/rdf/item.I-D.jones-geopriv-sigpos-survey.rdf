    <description>Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create a signal map allowing for subsequent device location determination. This document describes a method by which a Survey Device is able to provide indoor location related measurement data to a LIS for positioning purposes.  Location related measurement information comprises observations concerning properties related to the position of a Survey Device and the radio, electromagnetic, and other observable environmental measures as perceived by the Survey Device. These measurements could be data about Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth signals, barometric pressure, or any other environmental measurement which could sent to a LIS for subsequent processing to help determine the location of devices that later enter the venue.  A basic set of location-related measurements, data rights disclosure and location types are defined.</description>
