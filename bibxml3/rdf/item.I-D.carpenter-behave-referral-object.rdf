    <description>The purpose of a referral is to enable a given entity in a multiparty application to pass information to another party.  This memo specifies a Generic Referral Object (GRO) to be used in the context of referrals.  The proposed object is compact and is application- independent.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported, as well as upper layer identifiers.  Additional information to characterise an enclosed reference is also described.  To allow proper interpretation of referrals, a new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.</description>
