    <description>In today's networking environment most enterprise networks span multiple physical sites.  Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) provides a scalable solution for L2/L3 connectivity across different sites using the currently deployed service provider and enterprise networks.  It is a very cost-effective and simple solution requiring deployment of a one or more OTV functional device at each of the enterprise sites.  This solution is agnostic to the technology used in the service provider network and connectivity between the enterprise and the service provider network.  This document provides an overview of this technology.</description>
