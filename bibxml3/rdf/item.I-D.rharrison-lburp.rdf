    <description>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Bulk Update/Replication Protocol (LBURP) allows an LDAP client to perform a bulk update to an LDAP server. The protocol frames a sequenced set of update operations within a pair of LDAP extended operations to notify the server that the update operations in the framed set are related in such a way that the ordering of all operations can be preserved during processing even when they are sent asynchronously by the client. Update operations can be grouped within a single protocol message to maximize the efficiency of client-server communication. The protocol is suitable for efficiently making a substantial set of updates to the entries in an LDAP server.</description>
