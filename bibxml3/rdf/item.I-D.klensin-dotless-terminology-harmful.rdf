    <title>""Dotless Domains", Confusion, and DNS Terminology", John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klensin-dotless-terminology-harmful-00.txt</link>
    <description>The history of the DNS has included a great deal of confusion about terminology that has, in turn, led to discussions in which different parties have used the same words for different things.  For example, "host name" has been used to describe both fully-qualified domain names with particular properties and the first label component of such names.  While established inconsistent uses may be impossible to correct, it is in the interest of the community to avoid increasing the confusion.  There have recently been a number of discussions about "dotless domains" with at least four different definitions used or implied in different contexts.  This document explains those uses and recommends avoiding the use of the term.</description>
