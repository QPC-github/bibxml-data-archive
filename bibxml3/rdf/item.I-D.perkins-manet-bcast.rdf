    <description>An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which communicates over wireless channels and is capable of movement. Nodes participating in such an ad hoc network communicate on a peer-to-peer basis. Flooding is often a desired form of communication in these networks, as it can enable both the dissemination of control information and the delivery of data packets. This document describes a method for sending packets to every node in an ad hoc network.</description>
