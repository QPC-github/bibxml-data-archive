    <title>"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration With Prefixes Longer Than 64", Yu Hua Bing</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yhb-6man-slaac-improvement-00.txt</link>
    <description>IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 only supports 64-bit prefixes. This approach can't be deployed in the sites with prefixes longer than 64. We have no right to require that the sites MUST use 64-bit prefixes. This document tries to implement stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes longer than 64.</description>
