    <title>"A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)", Fernando Gont</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses-17.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a method for generating IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be used with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), such that addresses configured using this method are stable within each subnet, but the Interface Identifier changes when hosts move from one network to another.  This method is meant to be an alternative to generating Interface Identifiers based on hardware addresses (e.g., IEEE LAN MAC addresses), such that the benefits of stable addresses can be achieved without sacrificing the privacy of users.  The method specified in this document applies to all prefixes a host may be employing, including link-local, global, and unique- local addresses.</description>
