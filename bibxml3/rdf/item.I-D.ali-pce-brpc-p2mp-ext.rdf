    <description>The ability to compute constrained Traffic Engineering Label  Switched Paths (TE LSPs) for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs  in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS  (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a domain is  a collection of network elements within a common sphere of  address management or path computational responsibility such  as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems) has been identified  as a key requirement [PCEP-P2MP-REQ]. This document addresses  this requirement by extending backward recursive path  computation (BRPC) technique proposed for Point-to-Point  (P2P) LSPs in [P2P-BRPC] for P2MP LSP path computation in a  multiple domains network.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client  and server respectively.</description>
