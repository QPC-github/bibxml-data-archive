        <title>"Delegated Authority for Bootstrap Voucher Artifacts", Michael Richardson, Wei Pan</title>

        <description>This document describes an extension of the RFC8366 Voucher Artifact in order to support delegation of signing authority.  The initial voucher pins a public identity, and that public indentity can then issue additional vouchers.  This chain of authorization can support permission-less resale of devices, as well as guarding against business failure of the BRSKI [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).</description>
