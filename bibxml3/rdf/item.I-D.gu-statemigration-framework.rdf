    <title>"A Framework and Problem Statement for Flow-associated Middlebox State Migration", Gu Yingjie, Melinda Shore, Senthil Sivakumar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gu-statemigration-framework-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents an initial framework and discussion of the problem of transferring middlebox (for example, firewall or NAT) flow-coupled state from one middlebox to another while the flow is still active.  This has most recently come up in the context of virtual machine (VM) migration between hypervisors, but it is a problem that has appeared in other situations, as well.  We present some of the parameters of the problem, define some language for discussing the problem, and begin to identify a path forward for addressing it.</description>
