    <title>"IANA registrations of SDP 'proto' attribute for transporting RTP Media over TCP under various RTP profiles.", Suhas Nandakumar</title>

    <description>RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the SDP, to refer to the transport methods.  This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.</description>
