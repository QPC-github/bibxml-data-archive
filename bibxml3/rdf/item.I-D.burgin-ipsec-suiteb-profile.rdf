    <title>"Suite B Profile for Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)", Kelley Burgin, Michael Peck</title>

    <description>The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security applications.  This document specifies the conventions for using Suite B cryptography in IP Security (IPsec).  Since many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments as well, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B algorithms are already specified in other documents.  This document references the source of these conventions, with some relevant details repeated to aid developers that choose to support Suite B.</description>
