    <title>"Use case: Dissemination of IP packets to geographical areas", Georgios Karagiannis, Geert Heijenk</title>

    <description>This document describes the use case where IP packets are disseminated to geographical areas, based on geographical location information. A source node, which may be located anywhere, sends packets to an access router through the Internet. Those access routers are selected based on geographical location information, and traffic is routed to them using the IP address of the router and conventional IP routing. Each of the destination access routers then copies and broadcasts the received packets to listeners within its (1) radio coverage for wireless access routers or (2) IP subnet for wired access routers.</description>
