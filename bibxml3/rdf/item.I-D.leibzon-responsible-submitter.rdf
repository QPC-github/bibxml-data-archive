    <title>"Responsible Submitter of an E-mail Message", William Leibzon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-leibzon-responsible-submitter-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service, which allows an SMTP client to specify the responsible submitter of an e-mail message. The responsible submitter is the e-mail address of the entity most recently responsible for introducing a message into the transport stream. This extension helps receiving e-mail servers efficiently determine whether the SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf of the responsible submitter's domain.</description>
