    <description>CMLP is proposed as a tool System and Network Administrators can use to rapidly identify maintenance work performed on local and remote networked hosts including routers, switches, servers, and firewalls as well as other networked devices.  The primary drivers for creation of CMLP are improving network availability and decreasing restoral time through rapid identifiation of change activity in the enterprise network environment.</description>
