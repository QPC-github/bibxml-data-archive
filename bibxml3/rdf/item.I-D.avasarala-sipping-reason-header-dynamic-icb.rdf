    <description>The 3GPP, as part of the MITE work item, is defining the Multimedia Telephony service and other Supplementary services using the IP Multimedia Core Network framework.  Supplementary services include Incoming and Outgoing Communication Barring.  This document describes a new set of procedures for Incoming Communication Barring to allow terminating users to dynamically block unwanted incoming communications.  A new extension to SIP reason header is also described.</description>
