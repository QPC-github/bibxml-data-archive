    <title>"Distributed Autonomous Depth-first Routing Protocol in LLN", Tadashige Iwao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iwao-roll-dadr-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document is a proposal of the distributed autonomous depth-first  routing (DADR) protocol which is quite different from conventional  algorithms such as AODV and OLSR. It proposes a traversable algorithm  which can determine a direct path between the global source and the  global destination in a low power and lossy network (LLN). We propose  the DADR algorithm whose characteristics work well in LLNs with more  than 10^4 nodes. This algorithm selects a direct path between the  global source and the global destination based on a routing-cost-  function which identifies path-candidates with good communication  quality between each pair of nodes on the path. This protocol does  not need to configure the equipment such as setting IP addresses, and  thisresults in saving cost and time in deploying, establishing and  operating a large scale network.
