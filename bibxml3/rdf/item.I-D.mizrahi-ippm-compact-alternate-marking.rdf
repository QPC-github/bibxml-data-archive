    <description>This memo introduces new alternate marking methods that require a compact overhead of either a single bit per packet, or zero bits per packet.  This memo also presents a summary of alternate marking methods, and discusses the tradeoffs among them.  The target audience of this document is network protocol designers; this document is intended to help protocol designers choose the best alternate marking method(s) based on the protocol's constraints and requirements.</description>
