    <title>"Robust Configuration Management within NETCONF", Robert Cole, Dan Romascanu, Andy Bierman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cole-netconf-robust-config-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration management protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform sets of active tests (i.e., verification) against servers' running configuration over a period of time to afford the client and server a more robust and resilient configuration management capability.  This is of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as well as wireless emergency and military networks.  We accomplish this through the definition of the new verify.yang module.  Servers supporting this module will advertise this capability according to the YANG specification.  We also explore the future alternatives for developing these capabilities within the context of the existing NETCONF protocol, the YANG modeling language and existing related IETF, IEEE and ITU-T standards.</description>
