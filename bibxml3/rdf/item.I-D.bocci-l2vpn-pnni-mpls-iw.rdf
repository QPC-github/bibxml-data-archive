    <title>"Signalling Interworking for Asynchronous Transfer Mode Virtual Private Wire  Service", Matthew Bocci</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bocci-l2vpn-pnni-mpls-iw-02.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet Draft describes a method for control plane interworking for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) pseudo wires, where Provider Edge nodes (PEs) on both sides of an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN) connect edge ATM networks using the Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) or the ATM Inter-Network Interface (AINI). In this method, ATM signalling and routing messages are tunnelled over the PSN using dedicated pseudo wires, enabling ATM pseudo wires carrying user traffic to be established and release dynamically by ATM. The method does not require changes to existing IETF defined protocols in order to support all features of PNNI and AINI.</description>
