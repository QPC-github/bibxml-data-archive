    <description>To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the identities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover, along with their capabilities, prior to the initiation of the IP-layer handover. The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects to it: Identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and finding the capabilities of those CARs. This process is called 'candidate access router discovery' (CARD). At the time of IP-layer handover, that CAR, whose capabilities is a good match to the preferences of the MN, may be chosen as the target AR for handover. The protocol described in this document allows a mobile node to perform CARD.</description>
