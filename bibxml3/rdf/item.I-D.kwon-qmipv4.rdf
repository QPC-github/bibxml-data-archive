    <title>"QMIP: Query-based Mobile IP", Soon-Hong Kwon, Seok Koh</title>

    <description>Mobile IP (MIP) suffers from the so-called triangular routing problem. Moreover, MIP Home Agent (HA) tends to undergo severe data traffic load, since it should deliver all the data packets toward mobile nodes. This paper proposes a simple extension of MIP, called Query- based MIP (QMIP), in which the binding query to HA will be used to get the care-of address of a mobile node and to deliver the subsequent data packets over the optimized data path. The proposed QMIP scheme can be applied to MIPv4 and Proxy MIPv6 as well.</description>
