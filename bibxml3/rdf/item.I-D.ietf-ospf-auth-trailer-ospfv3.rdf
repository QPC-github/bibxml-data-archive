    <description>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec as the only mechanism for authenticating protocol packets.  This behavior is different from authentication mechanisms present in other routing protocols (OSPFv2, IS-IS, RIPng). In some environments, it has been found that IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and cannot be used.  This document proposes an alternative mechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon only IPsec for authentication.</description>
