        <description>It is hard to adjust traffic and optimize traffic paths in a traditional IP network from time to time through manual configurations.  It is desirable to have a mechanism for setting up routing policies, which adjusts traffic and optimizes traffic paths automatically.  This document describes BGP Extensions for Routing Policy Distribution (BGP RPD) to support this.</description>
