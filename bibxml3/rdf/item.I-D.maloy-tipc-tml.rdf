    <title>"TIPC based TML for the ForCES protocol", Jon Maloy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-maloy-tipc-tml-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a ForCES [ForCES] Transport Mapping layer (TML) based on the Transparent Inter Process Communication service [TIPC]. It is intended to be used when the ForCES protocol is transported over L2 carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or PCI- Express. TIPC has been specially designed for efficient and easy-to- use communication over L2 carriers, and is typically used to define clusters of loosely coupled nodes in such environments.</description>
