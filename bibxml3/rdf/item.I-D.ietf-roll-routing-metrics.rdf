    <description>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks that require the specification of new routing metrics and constraints.  By contrast with typical Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link metrics, this document specifies a set of link and node routing metrics and constraints suitable to LLNs to be used by the Routing for Low Power and lossy networks (RPL) routing protocol.</description>
