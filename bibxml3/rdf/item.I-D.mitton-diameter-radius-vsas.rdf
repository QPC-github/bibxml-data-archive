    <title>"Diameter/RADIUS Vendor Specific AVP Translation", David Mitton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mitton-diameter-radius-vsas-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how a Diameter protocol application would interact with a RADIUS protocol application with respect to translation of Vendor Specific Attributes and AVPs in both networks. This interactions between Diameter applications and RADIUS specified in this document are in addition to that specified in the Diameter Base, the Diameter NAS Application and RADIUS. In this sense, this document extends the Base Diameter protocol and requests an addition to the RADIUS attribute space.</description>
