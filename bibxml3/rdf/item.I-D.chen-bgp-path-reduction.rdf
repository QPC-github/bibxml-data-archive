    <title>"Reduction of BGP Alternate Paths from Inter-Exchange Points", Enke Chen, Pradosh Mohapatra</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-bgp-path-reduction-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this document we present a mechanism that enhances the "IGP-metric based MED" approach so that load balancing is maintained while limiting the number of BGP alternate paths carried in a network.  The mechanism involves the use of a "scale factor" to scale down the IGP metrics for the purpose of setting MEDs, and is thus termed "scaled IGP-metric based MED".</description>
