    <title>"Security is a function, not a layer", Mirja Kuehlewind</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kuehlewind-security-is-not-a-layer-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document argues that security functions should be implemented on each layer as needed.  Especially security functions should not be separated in its own layer.  Having security scoped to the needs of each layer makes it possible to separate different functions correctly without the risk of impacting security on another layer. Note that this does not mean that each layer needs to maintain and negotiate it's on security context.</description>
