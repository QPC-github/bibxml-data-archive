    <description>DOTS client signal using original signal communication channel can expect service degradation and even service disruption as any other service over Internet but in more severe conditions because the signal may have to be transmitted over congested paths due to the denial-of-service attack.  This document specifies a fall-back asynchronous mechanism using an intermediate agent to store DOTS signal information during a limited period of time.  This mechanism allows a DOTS server to request a signal information stored by a DOTS client when no heartbeat is received from the DOTS client.  This intermediate agent called DOTS Signal Repository have to be connected to the DOTS client and server independently.  The repository must be located and/or reached through one or multiple network paths, preferably as most as possible disjoint from regular signal channel, in order to increase its reachability.  The document introduces a set of support protocols to build the asynchronous communication between the DOTS cient, server and the repository.</description>
