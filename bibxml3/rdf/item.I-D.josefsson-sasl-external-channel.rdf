    <title>"SASL Mechanism Family for External Authentication: EXTERNAL-*", Simon Josefsson, Carolin Latze</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-josefsson-sasl-external-channel-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a way to perform client authentication in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework by referring to the client authentication provided by an external security layer.  We specify a SASL mechanism family EXTERNAL-* and one instance EXTERNAL-TLS that rely on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  This mechanism differs to the existing EXTERNAL mechanism by alleviating the a priori assumptions that servers and clients needs somehow negotiate out of band which secure channel that is intended.  This document also discuss the implementation of authorization decisions.  See &lt;http://josefsson.org/external-channel/> for more information.</description>
