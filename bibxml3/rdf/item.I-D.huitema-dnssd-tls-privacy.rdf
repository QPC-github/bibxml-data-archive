    <title>"Private Discovery with TLS-ESNI", Christian Huitema, Daniel Kaiser</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huitema-dnssd-tls-privacy-01.txt</link>
    <description>DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about both the devices offering services and the devices requesting services.  This information includes host names, network parameters, and possibly a further description of the corresponding service instance.  Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS Service Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy problem arises.  We propose to solve this problem by developing a private discovery profile for UDP based transports using TLS, such as DTLS and QUIC. The profile is based on using the Encrypted SNI extension.  We also define a standalone private discovery service, that can be combined with arbitrary applications in the same way as DNS-SD.</description>
