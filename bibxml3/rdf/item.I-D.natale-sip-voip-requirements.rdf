    <title>"Requirements for SIP-based VoIP Interconnection", Bob Natale</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-natale-sip-voip-requirements-00.txt</link>
    <description>This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG as a candidate for the chartered work item dealing with "the minimum set of requirements for SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)", due in March 2007. In its present form, this draft is intended solely to provide a basis for WG discussion about requirements selection. As such, it is primarily structural and descriptive in nature, leaving prescriptive content to later revisions driven by WG consensus.</description>
