    <title>"Diverse Inter-Region Path Setup/Establishment", A D’Achille</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dachille-diverse-inter-region-path-setup-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end diverse or disjoint label switched paths (LSPs) across multiple regions, as required for inter-area and inter-AS traffic engineering. The mechanism relies on the joint computation, in each region, of the LSP segments of the diversely routed LSPs, thereby achieving the simplicity of the per-domain approach with effectively no changes to the signaling protocols. This is achieved by the use of a new RSVP- TE object, called the Associated Route Object or ARO, which is defined in this document and used in the signaling messages in support of the scheme.</description>
