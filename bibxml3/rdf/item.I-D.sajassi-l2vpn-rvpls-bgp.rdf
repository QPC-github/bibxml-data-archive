    <description>VPLS, as currently defined, has challenges pertaining to the areas of redundancy and multicast optimization. In particular, multi- homing with all-active forwarding cannot be supported and there's no known solution to date for leveraging MP2MP MDTs for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames. This document defines an evolution of the current VPLS solution, referred to as Routed VPLS (R-VPLS), to address these shortcomings. In addition, this solution offers several benefits over current VPLS such as: ease of provisioning, per-flow load-balancing of traffic from/to multi-homed sites, optimum traffic forwarding to PEs with both single-homed and multi-homed sites, support for flexible multi-homing groups and fast convergence upon failures.
