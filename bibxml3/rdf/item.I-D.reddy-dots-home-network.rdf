    <title>"Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel Call Home", Reddy K, Mohamed Boucadair, Jon Shallow</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-reddy-dots-home-network-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents DOTS signal channel Call Home service, which enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS client, and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS client.  The DOTS server in turn uses the attack traffic information to identify the compromised devices launching the outgoing DDoS attack and takes appropriate mitigation action.  The Call Home service is not specific to the home networks; the solution targets any deployment which requires to block DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS attack.</description>
