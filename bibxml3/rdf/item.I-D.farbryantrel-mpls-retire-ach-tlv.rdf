    <title>"Retiring TLVs from the Associated Channel Header of the MPLS Generic Associated Channel", Adrian Farrel, Stewart Bryant</title>

    <description>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called ACH TLVs  No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to be processed substantially in hardware, the use of TLVs in undesirable.  This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.</description>
