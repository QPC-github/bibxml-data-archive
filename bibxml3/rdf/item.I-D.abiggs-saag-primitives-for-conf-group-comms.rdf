    <title>"Primitives for Confidential Group Communications", Andrew Biggs, Shaun Cooley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-abiggs-saag-primitives-for-conf-group-comms-01.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines generalized primitives for use in establishing end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications. These primitives address three essential elements of group privacy: authentication, group membership, and secure key exchange.  The purpose is to define these primitives in such a way as they may be leveraged as common constructs within new and existing secure group communications protocols, and in support of both centralized and decentralized architectures.</description>
