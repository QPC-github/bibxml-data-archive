    <description>Some service providers want to build a service which guarantees QoS or bandwidth from a local CE to a remote CE through the network. Today, customers expect to run triple play services through BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. As a result, their requirements for end-to-end QoS of applications are increasing. Depending on the application (e.g., voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe, etc.), an end-to-end  native RSVP path and/or an end-to-end MPLS TE LSP are required, and they need to meet some constraints.
