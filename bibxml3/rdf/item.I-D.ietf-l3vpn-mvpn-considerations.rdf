    <description>More that one set of mechanisms to support multicast in a layer 3 BGP/MPLS VPN has been defined.  These are presented in the documents that define them as optional building blocks.  To enable interoperability between implementations, this document defines a subset of features that is considered mandatory for a multicast BGP/MPLS VPN implementation.  This will help implementers and deployers understand which L3VPN multicast requirements are best satisfied by each option.</description>
