    <description>The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol ([RFC7285]) defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between network endpoints.  This document defines a new service that allows an ALTO Client to retrieve several cost metrics in a single request for an ALTO Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Map.  In addition, it extends the constraints to further filter those maps by allowing a client to specify a logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.</description>
