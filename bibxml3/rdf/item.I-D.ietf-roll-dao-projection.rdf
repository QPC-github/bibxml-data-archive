        <title>"Root initiated routing state in RPL", Pascal Thubert, Rahul Jadhav, Michael Richardson</title>
        <dc:date>2022-06-03T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document extends RFC 6550, RFC 6553, and RFC 8138 to enable a RPL Root to install and maintain Projected Routes within its DODAG, along a selected set of nodes that may or may not include itself, for a chosen duration.  This potentially enables routes that are more optimized or resilient than those obtained with the classical distributed operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing Header or in terms of path length, which impacts both the latency and the packet delivery ratio.</description>
