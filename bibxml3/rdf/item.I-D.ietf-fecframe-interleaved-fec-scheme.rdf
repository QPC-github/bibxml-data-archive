    <title>"RTP Payload Format for 1-D Interleaved Parity FEC", Ali Begen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-fecframe-interleaved-fec-scheme-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of reasonable complexity.  The new payload format defined in this document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the DVB-IPTV Application-layer FEC specification.</description>
