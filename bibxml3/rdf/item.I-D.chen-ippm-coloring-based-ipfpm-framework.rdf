    <description>This document specifies a measurement method, the IP flow performance measurement (IPFPM).  With IPFPM, data packets are marked into different blocks of markers by changing one or more bits of packets. No additional delimiting packet is needed and the performance is measured in-service and in-band without the insertion of additional traffic.</description>
