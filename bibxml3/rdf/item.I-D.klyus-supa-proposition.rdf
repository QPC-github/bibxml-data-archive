    <description>The rapid growth in the variety and importance of traffic flowing over increasingly complex enterprise and service provider network architectures makes the task of network operations and management applications and deploying new services much more difficult. Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines an interface to a network management function that takes high-level, possibly network-wide policies as input and creates element configuration snippets as output. SUPA expresses policies using a generic policy information model, and outputs generic YANG data models.</description>
