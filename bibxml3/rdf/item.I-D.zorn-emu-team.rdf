    <title>"The Tunneled Extensible Authentication Method (TEAM)", Glen Zorn, Wenson Wu, Dan Harkins</title>

    <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the Tunneled Extensible Authentication Method (TEAM), which provides an encrypted and authenticated tunnel based on transport layer security (TLS) that encapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms.  TEAM uses TLS to protect against rogue authenticators, protect against various attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange and provide EAP peer identity privacy.  TEAM also provides support for chaining multiple EAP mechanisms, cryptographic binding between authentications performed by inner EAP mechanisms and the tunnel, exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs), and fragmentation and reassembly.</description>
