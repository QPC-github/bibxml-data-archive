    <title>"NAT Traversal for LISP Mobile Node", Dominik Klein, Matthias Hartmann, Michael Menth</title>

    <description>The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) is a new naming and addressing architecture to solve the Internet's routing scaling problem.  It separates global routing in the Internet from local routing and naming in end-user networks.  The basic LISP architecture does not support mobility.  The mobility extension LISP Mobile Node (LISP-MN) describes a mechanism that extends LISP to support mobile nodes and enables them to roam into LISP and non-LISP networks while being reachable under the same address.  Currently, LISP-MN does not support networks that use network address translation (NAT).  This document presents an extension for LISP-MN that makes LISP mobile nodes behind a NAT globally reachable.</description>
