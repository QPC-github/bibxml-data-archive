    <description>This Information Model applies to the Measurement Agent within a Large-Scale Measurement Platform.  As such it outlines the information that is (pre-)configured on the Measurement Agent or exists in communications with a Controller or Collector within an LMAP framework.  The purpose of such an Information Model is to provide a protocol and device independent view of the Measurement Agent that can be implemented via one or more Control and Report protocols.</description>
