    <description>The Generalized MPLS(GMPLS) suite of protocols h as been defined the protection and restoration mechanisms of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to realize the highly resilient and reliable networks. The objective of this document is to extract additional requirements for the signaling mechanisms in order to extend the applicability of the protection and restoration mechanisms for inter-domain LSPs.</description>
