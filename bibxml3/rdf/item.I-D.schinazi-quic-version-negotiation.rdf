    <title>"Compatible Version Negotiation for QUIC", David Schinazi, Eric Rescorla</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schinazi-quic-version-negotiation-02.txt</link>
    <description>QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client offered is unacceptable.  This document describes a version negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version.  Optionally, if the original and negotiated version share a compatible Initial format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org [1] or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: http://github.com/ekr/draft-schinazi-quic- version-negotiation [2].</description>
