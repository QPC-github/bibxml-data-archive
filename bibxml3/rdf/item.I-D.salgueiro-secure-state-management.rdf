    <description>Virtually every application on the web today that allows a user to log in or manipulate information stored on a server maintains some form of state management information.  Usually, the session context is established through the use of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) parameter or a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookie that identifies the session.  Without the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), such an information exchange introduces a security risk.  For a variety of reasons, TLS may not be desired or preferred in all situations and, in those cases, users are left vulnerable.  This memo provides a simple method for enabling secure exchange of state management information through HTTP in situations where TLS is not employed.</description>
