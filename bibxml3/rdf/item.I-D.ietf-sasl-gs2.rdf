    <title>"Using GSS-API Mechanisms in SASL: The GS2 Mechanism Family", Simon Josefsson, Nicolas Williams</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sasl-gs2-20.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/ GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel binding are supported.</description>
