    <title>"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement", Jan  Seedorf, Eric Burger</title>

    <description>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount of Internet resources.  Such applications often transfer large amounts of data in direct peer-to-peer connections.  However, they usually have little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics that, in many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices. This document describes problems related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer applications and associated issues such optimizations raise in the use of network-layer information.</description>
