        <description>This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM Remote ID specification defined in ASTM F3411 under Broadcast Remote ID (RID). It defines a few message schemes (sent within the Authentication Message) that can be used to authenticate past messages sent by a unmanned aircraft (UA) and provide proof of UA trustworthiness even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node.</description>
