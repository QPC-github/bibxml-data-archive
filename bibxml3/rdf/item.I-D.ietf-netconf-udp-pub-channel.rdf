    <description>This document describes a UDP-based publication channel for streaming telemetry use to collect data from devices.  A new shim header is proposed to facilitate the distributed data collection mechanism which directly pushes data from line cards to the collector.  Because of the lightweight UDP encapsulation, higher frequency and better transit performance can be achieved.</description>
