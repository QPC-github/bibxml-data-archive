        <description>In order to provide greater scalability, network confidentiality, and service independence, Segment Routing (SR) utilizes a Binding Segment Identifier (BSID).  It is possible to associate a BSID to an RSVP-TE- signaled Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path or an SR Traffic Engineering path.  The BSID can be used by an upstream node for steering traffic into the appropriate TE path to enforce SR policies. This document specifies the binding value as an MPLS label or Segment Identifier.  It further specifies an approach for reporting binding label/Segment Identifier (SID) by a Path Computation Client (PCC) to the Path Computation Element (PCE) to support PCE-based Traffic Engineering policies.</description>
