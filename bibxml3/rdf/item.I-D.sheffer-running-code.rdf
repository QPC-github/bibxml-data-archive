    <title>"Improving Awareness of Running Code: the Implementation Status Section", Yaron Sheffer, Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sheffer-running-code-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status section.  This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, by considering the running code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that has made the implemented protocols more mature.  The process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents, and working groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.  The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this experiment and to report them to the community.</description>
