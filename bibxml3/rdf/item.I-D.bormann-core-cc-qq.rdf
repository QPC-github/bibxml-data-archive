    <title>"Qualifying Questions for a CoAP Advanced Congestion Control Scheme", Carsten Bormann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bormann-core-cc-qq-01.txt</link>
    <description>CoAP (RFC7252) comes with a conservative base congestion control scheme.  Advanced congestion control schemes can be defined where better performance is desired for a certain area of application.  This document is a strawman for a set of questions that could be used in qualifying a CoAP advanced congestion control scheme.</description>
