    <description>The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time.  Until recently these have been interim meetings, and following the all- virtual IETF-107 we expect to see more and more WG meetings take the virtual route.  A common practice at the IETF is to use room "humming" to gauge working group consensus, though the final consensus is determined by the working group chairs and typically requires a mailing list poll as well.  We do not have a technique equivalent to the hum for virtual meetings, and arguably this reduces the effectiveness of these meetings.  This document defines the requirements from a web application whose goal is to most faithfully replicate the "feel" of hums, through the use of a traditional web user interface.</description>
