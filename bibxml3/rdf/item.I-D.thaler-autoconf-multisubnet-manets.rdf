    <description>This document describes an approach to addressing nodes in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) which involves assigning a separate subnet to each MANET router. This approach avoids many of the problems that arise in other approaches, and is intended to allow existing protocols and applications to work unmodified.</description>
