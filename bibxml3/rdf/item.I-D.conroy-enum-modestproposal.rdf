    <title>"Non-Terminal NAPTR Processing: A Modest Proposal", Lawrence Conroy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-conroy-enum-modestproposal-00.txt</link>
    <description>Recent Discussions within the IETF and in other fora have highlighted differences in interpretation of the set of standards associated with ENUM and DDDS, on which it relies. Specifically, the operation and semantics surrounding support for non-terminal NAPTRs has led to some confusion. This document is an attempt to add clarification to non- terminal NAPTR processing. In this, it clarifies RFC3403. A subsequent document will build on this one to extend RFC3761 further, permitting registration of non-terminal Enumservices.</description>
