    <description>A new flexible grid of DWDM has been developed within the ITU-T Study Group 15 to allow a more efficient spectrum allocation. In such environment a data plane connection is switched based on the allocated variable width optical spectrum frequency slot. This new switching capability is referred to as Spectrum Switched Optical Networks (SSON). This draft describes the framework for the application of a GMPLS control plane to a SSON.</description>
