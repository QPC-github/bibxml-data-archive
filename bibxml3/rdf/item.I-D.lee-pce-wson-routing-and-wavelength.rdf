    <title>"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Requirements and  Extensions for the Support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein</title>

    <description>This memo provides application-specific PCEP requirements and protocol enhancements for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process. Different computational architectures for the RWA process are given and the PCEP extensions needed to support these architectures are defined.</description>
