        <description>This document introduces a mechanism to specify a Segment Routing (SR) policy, as a collection of SR candidate paths.  An SR policy is identified by &lt;headend, color, endpoint&gt; tuple.  An SR policy can contain one or more candidate paths where each candidate path is identified in PCEP by its uniquely assigned PLSP-ID.  This document proposes extension to PCEP to support association among candidate paths of a given SR policy.  The mechanism proposed in this document is applicable to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes of SR.</description>
