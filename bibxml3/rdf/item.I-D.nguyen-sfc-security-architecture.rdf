    <title>"A Security Architecture Against Service Function Chaining Threats", THANG Nguyen, Minho Park</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nguyen-sfc-security-architecture-00.pdf</link>
    <description>Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a special capability that defines an ordered list of network services as a virtual chain and makes a network more flexible and manageable.  However, SFC is vulnerable to various attacks caused by compromised switches, especially the middlebox-bypass attack.  In this document, we propose a security architecture that can detect not only middlebox-bypass attacks but also other incorrect forwarding actions by compromised switches.  The existing solutions to protect SFC against compromised switches and middlebox-bypass attacks can only solve individual problems.  The proposed architecture uses both probe-based and statistics-based methods to check the probe packets with random pre- assigned keys and collect statistics from middleboxes for detecting any abnormal actions in SFC.</description>
