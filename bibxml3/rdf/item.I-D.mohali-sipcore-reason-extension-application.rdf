    <title>"Extending the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header for Applications", Marianne Mohali, Bruno Chatras</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mohali-sipcore-reason-extension-application-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new protocol value "Application" for the Reason Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering application types.  This new value enables signaling that a request or response has been issued as a result of a decision made by a particular type of application or that an initial request has been retargeted as a result of an application decision.</description>
