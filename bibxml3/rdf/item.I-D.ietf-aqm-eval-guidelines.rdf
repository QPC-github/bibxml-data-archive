    <description>Unmanaged large buffers in today's networks have given rise to a slew of performance issues.  These performance issues can be addressed by some form of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism, optionally in combination with a packet scheduling scheme such as fair queuing. This document describes various criteria for performing characterizations of AQM schemes, that can be used in lab testing during development, prior to deployment.</description>
