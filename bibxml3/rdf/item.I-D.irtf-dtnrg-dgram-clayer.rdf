    <title>"Datagram Convergence Layers for the DTN Bundle and LTP Protocols", Hans Kruse, Samuel Jero, Shawn Ostermann</title>

    <description>This document is a product of the Delay- and Distruption-Tolerant Networking Research Group (DTNRG), and represents the consensus of the DTNRG.  It specifies the preferred method for transporting Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol data over the Internet using datagrams.  The specification covers convergence layers for the Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) as well as the transportation of Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) (RFC 5326) segments.  UDP and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) are the candidate datagram protocols discussed.  UDP can only be used on a local network, or in cases where the DTN node implements explicit congestion control.  DCCP addresses the congestion control problem, and its use is recommended whenever possible.</description>
