    <description>With the development of novel network technology, such as software defined networking and network function virtualization, many novel multi-domain applications, such as flexible interdomain routing, distributed, federated machine learning and multi-domain collaborative dataset transfer, have been deployed.  These applications can benefit substantially from the ALTO protocol [RFC7285], through which the information of multiple networks can be provided to applications.  This document first introduces several multi-domain applications and how they can benefit from ALTO.  It then describes a generic framework for multi-domain applications to use ALTO to improve the performance, followed by a discussion on new requirements and challenges for ALTO to better support these applications.</description>
