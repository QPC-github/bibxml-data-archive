        <description>This documents defines a new exchange, called Intermediate Exchange, for the Internet Key Exchange protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  This exchange can be used for transferring large amount of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment. Introducing Intermediate Exchange allows re-using existing IKE fragmentation mechanism, that helps to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE messages, but cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange.</description>
