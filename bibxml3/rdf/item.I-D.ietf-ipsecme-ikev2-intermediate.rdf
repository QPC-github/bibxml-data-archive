        <description>This document defines a new exchange, called Intermediate Exchange, for the Internet Key Exchange protocol Version 2 (IKEv2).  This exchange can be used for transferring large amounts of data in the process of IKEv2 Security Association (SA) establishment.  An example of the need to do this is using Quantum Computer resistant key exchange methods for IKE SA establishment.  Introducing the Intermediate Exchange allows re-using the existing IKE fragmentation mechanism, that helps to avoid IP fragmentation of large IKE messages, but cannot be used in the initial IKEv2 exchange.</description>
