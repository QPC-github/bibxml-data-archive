    <description>Historically MPLS label distribution was driven by protocols like LDP, RSVP and LBGP.  All of those protocols are session oriented.  In order to obtain label binding for a given destination FEC from a given router one needs first to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.  Advertising MPLS labels in IGPs [I-D.gredler-rtgwg-igp-label-advertisement] describes several use cases where utilizing the flooding machinery of link-state protocols for MPLS label distribution allows to obtain the binding without requiring to establish an LDP/RSVP/LBGP session with that router.  This document describes the protocol extension to distribute MPLS label bindings by the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.</description>
