    <title>"UDP Checksum Complement in OWAMP and TWAMP", Tal Mizrahi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ippm-checksum-trailer-06.txt</link>
    <description>The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) are used for performance monitoring in IP networks. Delay measurement is performed in these protocols by using timestamped test packets. Some implementations use hardware-based timestamping engines that integrate the accurate transmission timestamp into every outgoing OWAMP/TWAMP test packet during transmission.  Since these packets are transported over UDP, the UDP checksum field is then updated to reflect this modification. This document proposes to use the last 2 octets of every test packet as a Checksum Complement, allowing timestamping engines to reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather than in the UDP checksum field. The behavior defined in this document is completely interoperable with existing OWAMP/TWAMP implementations.</description>
