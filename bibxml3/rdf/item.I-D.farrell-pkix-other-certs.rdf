    <description>Some applications that associate state information with public key certificates can benefit from a way to link together a set of certificates belonging to the same end entity that can safely be considered to be equivalent for the purposes of referencing that application state information.  This memo defines a certificate extension that supports such linkage that can allow applications to establish the required linkage without introducing a new application protocol data unit.</description>
