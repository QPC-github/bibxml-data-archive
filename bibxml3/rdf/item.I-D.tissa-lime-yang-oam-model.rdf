    <description>This document presents base YANG Data model for OAM.  It provides a protocol-independent and technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs.  Based model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details.  This is leading to uniformity between OAM technologies and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different layers through a unified interface).</description>
