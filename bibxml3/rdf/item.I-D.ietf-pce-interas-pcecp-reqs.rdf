    <description>Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineered (MPLS TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be established wholly within an Autonomous System (AS) or may cross AS boundaries.  The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a component that is capable of computing constrained paths for (G)MPLS TE LSPs. The PCE Communication Protocol(PCEP) is defined to allow communication between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, and between PCEs. The PCEP is used to request constrained paths and to supply computed paths in response. Generic requirements for the PCEP are set out in "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements", RFC 4657. This document extends those requirements to cover the use of PCEP in support of inter-AS MPLS TE.Conventions Used in This Document</description>
