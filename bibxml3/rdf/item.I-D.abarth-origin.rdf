    <title>"The Web Origin Concept", Adam Barth</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-abarth-origin-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the concept of an "origin", which represents a web principal.  Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent a malicious web site operator from interfering with the operation of benign web sites.  In particular, this document defines how to compute an origin from a URI, how to serialize an origin to a string, and an HTTP header, named "Origin", for indicating which origin caused the user agent to issue a particular HTTP request.</description>
