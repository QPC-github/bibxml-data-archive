    <title>"An Architecture for Multi-Segment Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge", Matthew Bocci, Stewart Bryant</title>

    <description>This document describes an architecture for extending pseudowire emulation across multiple packet switched network segments. Scenarios are discussed where each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated service spans a different provider's PSN, and where the emulated service originates and terminates on the same provider's PSN, but may pass through several PSN tunnel segments in that PSN. It presents an architectural framework for such multi-segment pseudowires, defines</description>
