    <description>This memoy defines the Accept-Any option, which provides a more flexible content negotiation than the one originally specified for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in [RFC7252].  As this is particularly useful with but ruled out in CoAP observation ([RFC7641]), that is updated to allow it.</description>
