    <title>"The Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format", Hervé Debar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idwg-idmef-xml-16.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest to intrusion detection and response systems, and to the management systems which may need to interact with them. This Internet-Draft describes a data model to represent information exported by intrusion detection systems, and explains the rationale for using this model. An implementation of the data model in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presented, an XML Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided.</description>
