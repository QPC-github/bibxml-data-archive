    <description>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital signature based design for an HTTP authentication method.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords, such as leakage of server-side password databases.</description>
