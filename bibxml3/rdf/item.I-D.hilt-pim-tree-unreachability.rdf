    <title>"Join failure notification for PIM-SM multicast routing", Benoit Hilt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hilt-pim-tree-unreachability-00.txt</link>
    <description>Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing protocol in the Internet. Nevertheless this multicast protocol lacks connectivity debugging function, making it difficult to identify for example; -multicast routing problem, -source unavailability, -RP failure, etc... When a host wants to receive a multicast group/ channel, if for any reason the associated tree branch cannot be built, nothing exists to inform the receiver or its network about this failure. We propose here a new PIM message suitable for Join forwarding error notification. It is able to inform where and why such an error happened in the network and this without using a multicast traceroute mechanism. This message is also suitable to reduce globally the impact of useless branches in a PIM domain. Furthermore it should be used to block DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.</description>
