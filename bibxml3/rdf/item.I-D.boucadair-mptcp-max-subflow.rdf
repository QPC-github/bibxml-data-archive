    <title>"Negotiating the Maximum Number of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Subflows", Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-mptcp-max-subflow-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an experimental Multipath TCP (MPTCP) option that is meant to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be established and maintained for a given MPTCP connection.  The purpose is to minimize any possible performance degradation that can be induced by a possibly large number of establishment requests for additional subflows if the remote endpoint is not appropriately dimensioned to handle such requests.</description>
