    <description>This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint Authentication (RFA) with public keys as a potential peer authentication method with KARP pair wise and group Key Management Protocols (KMPs).  The advantage of RFA is, it neither requires out- of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full PKI based system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication of peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a significant operational improvement from symmetric key based systems and yet provide a secure authentication technique.</description>
