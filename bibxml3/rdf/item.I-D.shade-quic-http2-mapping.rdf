    <title>"HTTP/2 Semantics Using The QUIC Transport Protocol", Robbie Shade, Mike Warres</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shade-quic-http2-mapping-00.txt</link>
    <description>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a transport for HTTP/2, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a mapping of HTTP/2 semantics over QUIC. Specifically, this document identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how the other features can be implemented atop QUIC.</description>
