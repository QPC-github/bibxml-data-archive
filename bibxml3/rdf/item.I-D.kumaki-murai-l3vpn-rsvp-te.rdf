    <description>IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sites across an IP/MPLS backbone. These VPNs can be operated using BGP/MPLS and a single provider edge (PE) node may provide access to multiple customer sites belonging to different VPNs.  The VPNs may support a number of customer services including RSVP and RSVP-TE traffic. This document describes how to support RSVP-TE between customer sites when a single PE supports multiple VPNs and labels are not used to identify VPNs between PEs.</description>
