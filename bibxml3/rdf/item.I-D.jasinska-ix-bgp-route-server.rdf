    <description>This document outlines a specification for multilateral interconnections at Internet exchange points (IXPs).  Multilateral interconnection is a method of exchanging routing information between three or more exterior BGP speakers using a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a route server.  Route servers are typically used on shared access media networks, such as Internet exchange points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection between multiple Internet routers.</description>
