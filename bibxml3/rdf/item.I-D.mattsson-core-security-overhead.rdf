    <title>"Message Size Overhead of CoAP Security Protocols", John Mattsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mattsson-core-security-overhead-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads when using different security protocols to secure CoAP.  The analyzed security protocols are DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and OSCORE.  DTLS and TLS are analyzed with and without compression. DTLS are analyzed with two different alternatives for header compression as well as with and without Connection ID.</description>
