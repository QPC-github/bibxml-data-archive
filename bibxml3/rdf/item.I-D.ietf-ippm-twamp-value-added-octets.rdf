    <description>This memo describes an extension to the TWAMP test protocol for identifying and managing packet trains, which enables measuring capacity metrics like the available path capacity, tight section capacity and UDP delivery rate in the forward and reverse path directions.  This memo contains the description of a working prototype. It does not represent a consensus of the IETF community. The IETF community is currently working on the problem statement and has not reached consensus on the preferred method for measuring capacity metrics.</description>
