    <title>"Framing ALC Packets over Connection-Oriented Transport", Imed Bouazizi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bouazizi-rmt-alcframing-00.txt</link>
    <description>ALC and FLUTE are reliable content delivery protocols designed mainly for scalable multicast distribution. However, this does not preclude their deployment in the Unicast distribution mode over connectionless or connection-oriented transport protocols. A method for framing ALC and FLUTE packets onto connection-oriented transport is presented. A definition of the descriptors of the framing method for those protocols is also given.</description>
