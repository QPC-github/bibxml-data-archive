    <title>"IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Dispatch Type for SCHC", Carles Gomez</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gomez-6lo-schc-dispatch-01.txt</link>
    <description>A new framework called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) has been designed with the primary goal of supporting IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC components is a header compression mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC header compression allows a greater compression ratio than that achievable with traditional 6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282]. For this reason, it may make sense to use SCHC header compression in some 6LoWPAN environments.  This document defines a 6LoWPAN Dispatch Type to signal when a packet header has been compressed by using SCHC header compression.</description>
