    <description>This document describes a protocol-independent method that employs two bits to allow endpoints to signal packet loss in a way that can be used by network devices to measure and locate the source of the loss.  The signaling method applies to all protocols with a protocol- specific way to identify packet loss.  The method is especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport header and do not allow an alternative method for loss detection.</description>
