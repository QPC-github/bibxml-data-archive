    <title>"Passive Performance Measurement for SRv6 Network Programming", Cheng Li, Mach Chen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-spring-passive-pm-for-srv6-np-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a passive performance measurement method for SRv6 network programming.  In this method, performance measurement information can be carried in data packets by two ways.  One way is carrying measurement information by used SIDs.  Another way is carrying measurement information via related SRH TLVs.</description>
