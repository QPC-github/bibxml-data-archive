    <description>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  And a segment is identified by a Segment Routing ID (SID).  This document proposes a method to calculate SID forwarding entry within SR topology in a SR domain, and to guarantee the consistency of SR encapsulation forwarding.</description>
