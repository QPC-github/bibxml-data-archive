    <title>"Marking Converter for Excess-Marked Traffic", Michael Menth, Frank  Lehrieder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-menth-pcn-marking-converter-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings of a stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packet markings that correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based on a higher-rate.  It may be applied in the PCN context to convert marked admissible-rate-overload into marked supportable-rate- overload.  This allows to perform marked flow termination when packets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.</description>
