    <description>This memo documents the methodology and results of an experiment which tested the availability of the DNS Extension Mechanism (EDNS0) on a large set of authority-only nameservers.  The experiment was conducted in the bar during the IETF 72 meeting on 27 July 2008.  The results of this experiment suggest that EDNS0 deployment is extensive: it was found that 94.4% of non-defective authority-only servers are EDNS0-capable.</description>
