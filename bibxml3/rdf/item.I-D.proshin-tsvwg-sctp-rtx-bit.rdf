    <title>"Retransmit bit for SCTP DATA, I-DATA and SACK", Maksim Proshin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-proshin-tsvwg-sctp-rtx-bit-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a method which helps an SCTP sender to understand when a received SACK acknowledges the original transmission of a TSN or its retransmission.  It is done by specifying a new bit, called Retransmit bit (R-bit), in the header of DATA, I-DATA and SACK chunks.  The bit is used when a TSN is retransmitted and returned back in the acknowledgement.  This document updates [RFC4960] if approved.</description>
