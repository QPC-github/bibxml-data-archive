    <description>The performance monitoring (PM) of BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN) is important for satisfying the Service Level Agreement(SLA) for critical network services.  Since L3VPN is essentially using a multipoint-to-point service model, flow identification becomes a big challenge for L3VPN PM.  This document specifies the framework and mechanisms for the application of PM in L3VPN.</description>
