    <description>This document aims to enrich DOTS Signaling with various telemetry attributes allowing optimal DDoS/DoS attack mitigation.  The nature of the DOTS architecture is to allow DOTS Agents to be integrated in highly diverse environments.  Therefore, the DOTS architecture imposes a significant challenge in delivering optimal mitigation services.  The DOTS Telemetry covered in this document aims to provide all needed attributes and feedback signaled from DOTS Agents such that optimal mitigation services can be delivered based on DOTS Signaling.</description>
