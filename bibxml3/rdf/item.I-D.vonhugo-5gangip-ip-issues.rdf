    <description>This document presents considerations related to open issues with upcoming new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming to set a basis for documenting problem space, use-cases, and potential solutions related to next-generation network infrastructure.  The draft reviews currently investigated topics, including both inputs from IETF and from other SDOs as well as research activities. Further the outcome of recent discussions at side sessions during IETF meetings are recaptured to help identifying a starting point for future thoughts.</description>
