    <description>The PCE architecture [PCE-ARCH] introduces the concept of policy in the context of path computation. This document provides additional details on policy within the PCE Architecture and also provides context for the support of PCE Policy. This document introduces the use of the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) as a framework for supporting path computation policy. This document also provides representative scenarios for the support of PCE Policy.</description>
