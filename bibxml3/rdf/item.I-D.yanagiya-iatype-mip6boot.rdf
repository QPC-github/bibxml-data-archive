    <description>When we use DHCPv6 to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 service, stateful DHCP should be used to assign the home address. In [RFC3315], two types of IA are specified: IA_NA and IA_TA. When stateful DHCPv6 is used in a local network, the "care-of address" is carried as one of the IA_NA options. On the other hand, when autoconfiguration [FRC2462] is used, care-of address is generated on mobile node and there is no way to assign home address stateful. Thus, we introduce a new IA type to assign the home address.</description>
