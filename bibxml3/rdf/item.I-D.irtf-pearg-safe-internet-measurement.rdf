        <description>Researchers from industry and academia often use Internet measurements as part of their work.  While these measurements can give insight into the functioning and usage of the Internet, they can come at the cost of user privacy.  This document describes guidelines for ensuring that such measurements can be carried out safely.  Note  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the research group's mailing list at pearg@irtf.org and/or the author(s).
