    <description>There have been recent discussions on the CLUE and DISPATCH mailing lists about "roles" associated with multimedia conferences.  From the discussions it was apparent that there is some confusion as to what the current defined roles actually imply and that people had different understanding of the meaning and scope of the term "role". This draft seeks to identify the various "roles" that may be associated with a multimedia conference and to provide a grouping and nomenclature for further discussions on this topic.  Specific to CLUE this draft proposes a number of attributes to be able to clearly identify the various roles that may be associated with a media capture.</description>
