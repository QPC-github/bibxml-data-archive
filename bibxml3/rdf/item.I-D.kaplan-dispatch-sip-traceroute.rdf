    <title>"A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-dispatch-sip-traceroute-00.txt</link>
    <description>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A new mechanism for media-loopback calls is also being defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being looped back to the originator.  This document is a strawman proposal for a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.</description>
