    <description>The application programmable interfaces of RESTful, hypermedia-driven Web applications consist of a number of reusable components such as Internet media types and link relation types.  This document proposes "CoRE Applications", a convention for application designers to build the interfaces of their applications in a structured way, so that implementers can easily build interoperable clients and servers, and other designers can reuse the components in their own applications.</description>
