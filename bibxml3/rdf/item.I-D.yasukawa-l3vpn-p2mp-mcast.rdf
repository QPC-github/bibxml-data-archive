    <description>This document describes a solution framework for IP Multicast VPNs. It describes procedures for establishing optimal virtual private IP multicast networks over a provider network. The simple multicast tunnel operation mechanism within a core network provides easy and flexible IP multicast VPN service operation for the service provider. And because the solution can minimize PIM neighbor maintenance over remote PEs, the solution enhances the scalability performance of the multicast VPN service network. This document also describes a P2MP TE LSP based multicast tunnel mechanism which could enhance TE capability and reliability of IP multicast VPNs.</description>
