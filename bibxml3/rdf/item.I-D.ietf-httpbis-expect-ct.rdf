        <description>This document defines a new HTTP header field named Expect-CT, which allows web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts.  Expect-CT allows web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency deployments. Further, web host operaters can use Expect-CT to ensure that, if a UA which supports Expect-CT accepts a misissued certificate, that certificate will be discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.</description>
