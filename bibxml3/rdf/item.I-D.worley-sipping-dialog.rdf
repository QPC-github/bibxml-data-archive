    <description>This document sets out guidelines for how user agents should implement the dialog event package in order to be usable in systems that implement end-point controlled call-control (EPCC) features. It is in addition to the basic requirements for dialog event package implementation in RFC 3265 and draft-ietf-sipping-dialog-package.</description>
