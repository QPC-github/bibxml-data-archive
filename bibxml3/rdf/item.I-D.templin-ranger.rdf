    <title>"Routing and Addressing in Next-Generation EnteRprises (RANGER)", Fred Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-templin-ranger-09.txt</link>
    <description>RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in next generation enterprise networks.  The term "enterprise network" within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an "enterprise" can be as small as a SOHO network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad-hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multi-homing and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements, and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.</description>
