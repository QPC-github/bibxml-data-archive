    <title>"An Approach for Adding RTCWEB Media Streams without Glare", Adam Roach</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roach-rtcweb-glareless-add-00.txt</link>
    <description>One of the ongoing challenges in dealing with the massive number of streams that RTCWEB implementations may wish to instantiate and manipulate is the ability to add and remove streams in a way that avoids the condition known as "glare."  This document describes a non-normative set of behaviors that RTCWEB implementations can implement to completely avoid inducing a glare condition.</description>
