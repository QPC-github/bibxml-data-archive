    <title>"Negotiated Discrete Log Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters for TLS", Daniel Gillmor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gillmor-tls-negotiated-dl-dhe-02.txt</link>
    <description>Traditional discrete logarithm-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency shortcomings.  These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept.  This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by establishing a registry of DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to indicate support for these groups.</description>
