    <description>As more constrained devices are integrating with current Internet, the ubiquitous computing in scenarios like smart home is very important. In smart home, the constrained devices (ex. thermostat) need to be provisioned in such a way that it can inter-operate with any kind of devices like other constrained devices (ex. Air conditioner) or client devices (ex. smart phone). This document provides a method to support access privilege provisioning based on pre-configured admission and resource control policies, where this method explains device's service access in two different use cases: first provisioning the service when a constrained device accessing the service provided by other constrained device, second, accessing the service provided by constrained device from the client device (non constrained device).</description>
