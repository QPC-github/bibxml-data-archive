    <description>This memo describes a REST interface based on the RATS architecture that can be used to retrieve attested system state, for example the reading of a security critical sensor.  The objective is to present a common vocabulary of data formats and basic protocol transactions that can be pieced together into a cohesive interface that is capable of serving different attestation workflows.</description>
