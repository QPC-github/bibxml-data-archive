    <description>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due consideration of functionality needed to operate and manage the protocols.  Retrofitting operations and management is sub-optimal. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors and reviewers of documents defining new protocols or protocol extensions, about covering aspects of operations and management that should be considered.</description>
