    <title>"Returning a Location Information in a Location to Service Translation query", Brian Rosen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosen-ecrit-lost-return-li-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) to permit a location information to be returned in a findservice response.  When the validation is requested in the findservice request, the location information supplied in the request may have enough valid address components (CAtypes) to be considered valid, but the LoST server may wish to return address components CAtypes not found in the query.</description>
