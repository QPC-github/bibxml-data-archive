        <title>"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Directed Return Path for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", Greg Mirsky, Jeff Tantsura, Ilya Varlashkin, Mach Chen</title>

        <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to be able to monitor a wide variety of encapsulations of paths between systems. When a BFD session monitors an explicitly routed unidirectional path there may be a need to direct egress BFD peer to use a specific path for the reverse direction of the BFD session.</description>
