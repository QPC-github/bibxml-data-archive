    <title>"RSA based AES-GCM Cipher Suites for TLS", Joseph Salowey</title>

    <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated encryption operation. GCM provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication, can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations. This memo defines TLS ciphersuites that use AES-GCM with RSA.</description>
