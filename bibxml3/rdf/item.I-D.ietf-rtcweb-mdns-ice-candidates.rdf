    <description>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of creating peer-to-peer connections.  To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses are included in this candidate collection.  However, disclosure of these addresses has privacy implications.  This document describes a way to share local IP addresses with other clients while preserving client privacy.  This is achieved by concealing IP addresses with dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.</description>
