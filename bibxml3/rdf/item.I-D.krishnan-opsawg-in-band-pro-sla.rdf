    <title>"In-band Telemetry for a Proactive SLA Monitoring Framework", Ram Krishnan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-krishnan-opsawg-in-band-pro-sla-03.txt</link>
    <description>The goal of in-band telemetry is to drive per packet, per hop real- time monitoring for the infrastructure towards achieving a programmable proactive SLA monitoring framework. Some of the key aspects from a switch/NIC perspective are - ingress/egress timestamp (latency), queue depth, bandwidth etc. Some of the key aspects from a server perspective are - cache/memory statistics etc. This document summarizes the current work in the industry in this area and identifies key requirements for a comprehensive solution. Towards addressing the requirements, this document describes uses cases and defines reusable monitoring packet formats across all layers in the OAM hierarchy.</description>
