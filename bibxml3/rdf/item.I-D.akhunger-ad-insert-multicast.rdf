    <description>Providing a Standard method for Addition of regional Advertisements in the IP Multicast Video Streaming is very important , because the equipment deployed would most likely be from different vendors across a multicast network. The idea is to introduce a special kind of Enhanced IGMP Ad-Insert control packet, which is passed from the multicast source to intermediate routers and which indicates that the source is going to stop sending multicast traffic for a particular group for specified time and the Regional center can utilize this time to insert its regional advertisement.</description>
