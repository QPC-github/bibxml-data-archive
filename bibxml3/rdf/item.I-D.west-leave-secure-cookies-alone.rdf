    <title>"Deprecate modification of 'secure' cookies from non-secure origins", Mike West</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-west-leave-secure-cookies-alone-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document updates RFC6265 by removing the ability for a non- secure origin to set cookies with a 'secure' flag, and to overwrite cookies whose 'secure' flag is set.  This deprecation improves the isolation between HTTP and HTTPS origins, and reduces the risk of malicious interference.</description>
