        <description>The current BGP specification doesn't use network performance metrics (e.g., network latency) in the route selection decision process. This document describes a performance-based BGP routing mechanism in which network latency metric is taken as one of the route selection criteria.  This routing mechanism is useful for those server providers with global reach to deliver low-latency network connectivity services to their customers.</description>
