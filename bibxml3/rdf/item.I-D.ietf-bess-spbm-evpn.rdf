    <title>"Shortest Path Bridging, MAC Mode Support over EVPN", David Allan, Jeff Tantsura, Don Fedyk, Ali Sajassi</title>

    <description>This document describes how Ethernet Shortest Path Bridging MAC mode (802.1aq) can be combined with EVPN to interwork with PBB-PEs as described in the PBB-EVPN solution. This is achieved via operational isolation of each Ethernet network attached an EVPN core while supporting full interworking between the different variations of Ethernet networks.</description>
