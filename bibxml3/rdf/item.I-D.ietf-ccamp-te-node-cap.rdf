    <title>"IGP Routing Protocol Extensions for Discovery of Traffic Engineering Node  Capabilities", JP Vasseur</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-05.txt</link>
    <description>It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic Engineering (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) selection, such as for instance the capability to act as a branch Label Switching Router (LSR) of a Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP. This requires advertising these capabilities within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). For that purpose, this document specifies Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS) traffic engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.</description>
