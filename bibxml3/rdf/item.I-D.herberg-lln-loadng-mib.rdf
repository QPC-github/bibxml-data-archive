    <title>"Definition of Managed Objects for the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)", Ulrich Herberg, Robert Cole, Thomas Clausen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-herberg-lln-loadng-mib-04.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring parameters of the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng) process on a router.  The MIB module defined in this memo, denoted LOADng-MIB, also reports state.  While LOADng is layer agnostic and can be run with different address families (e.g., on L2 using MAC addresses, or on L3 using IP address), this MIB module assumes that LOADng is used on L3, and uses only IPv4/IPv6 addresses.</description>
