    <description>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  There are use cases where it is desirable to utilize a SID associated with a given node in order to transport traffic destined to different local services supported by such node.  This document defines the mechanism to do so and illustrates it.</description>
