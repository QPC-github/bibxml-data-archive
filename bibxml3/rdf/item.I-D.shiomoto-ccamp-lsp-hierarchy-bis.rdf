    <title>"Advertisement of hierarchical and stitchable Label Switched Paths as Traffic  Engineering Links", Kohei Shiomoto</title>

    <description>This document addresses topics related to hierarchical and stitched Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). It describes extensions to allow an egress to identify that a bi-directional LSP will be used as a dynamically signaled Forwarding Adjacency LSP (FA-LSP) or Routing Adjacency (RA). In addition, the document also addresses the issue of how to indicate that an LSP should be advertised as a traffic engineering (TE) link into a different instance of the IGP and how to identify the instance that should be used.</description>
