    <title>"Deployment Models for PCN-Based Admission Control and Flow Termination Using  Packet-Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)", Michael Menth</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-menth-pcn-psdm-deployment-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-based admission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet- specific dual marking (PSDM) for encoding.  Their major is that they require only a single DSCP for packet marking and that they work reliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs) with only a very small average number of flows.  Moreover, an advanced model even works with multipath routing.</description>
