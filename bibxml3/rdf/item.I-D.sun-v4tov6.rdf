    <description>Current approaches can not solve the scenario that the users from IPv4 Internet to access IPv6-only content.  When IPv6 content are becoming more and more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6- only content can be reachable from legacy IPv4-only clients via some IPv4-only network.  This document proposes an approach for IPv4-only users to access IPv6-only content, and can also achieve address sharing in the server side.
