    <title>"Usage of The RSVP Association Object", Lou Berger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-assoc-info-03.txt</link>
    <description>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) controlled label switched paths (LSPs).  In this context, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  This document reviews how association is to be provided in the context of GMPLS recovery.  No new procedures or mechanisms are defined by this document and it is strictly informative in nature.</description>
