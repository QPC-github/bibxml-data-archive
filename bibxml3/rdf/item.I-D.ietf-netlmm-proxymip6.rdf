    <description>Network-based mobility management enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any mobility related signaling.  The Network is responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.  The mobility entities in the network are responsible for tracking the movements of the host and initiating the required mobility signaling on its behalf.  This specification describes a network-based mobility management protocol and is referred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6.</description>
