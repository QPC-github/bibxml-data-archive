    <title>"Co-Constraints for JSON Content Rules", Pete Cordell, Andrew Newton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints-00.txt</link>
    <description>JSON Content Rules (JCR) [JCR] provides a powerful, intuitive and concise method for defining the structure of JSON [RFC7159] messages. However, modern JSON usage patterns occasionally mean that JCR alone is not able to capture the required constraints in a satisfactory way.  This document describes JCR Co-Constraints (JCRCC) which defines additional JCR directives and annotations that can be added to a JCR ruleset in order to define more detailed constraints on JSON messages.</description>
