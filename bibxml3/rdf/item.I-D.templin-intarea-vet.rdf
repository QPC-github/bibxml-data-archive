    <description>Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various link types, and often also connect to the global Internet either directly or via a provider network.  Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically provision addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), ISP networks, multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration and operation of nodes in dynamic enterprise networks.</description>
