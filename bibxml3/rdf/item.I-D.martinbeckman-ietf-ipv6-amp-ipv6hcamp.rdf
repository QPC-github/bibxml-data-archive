    <title>"IPv6 Header Compression via Addressing Mitigation Protocol (IPv6 AMP)", Martin Beckman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martinbeckman-ietf-ipv6-amp-ipv6hcamp-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document outlines a methodology for IPv6 Header Compression via mapping the source and destination addresses into a flow label value per address pair sessions with a specific traffic class field value to identify the packet as “address-less” compressed header. The resultant headers, sans addresses shrink from 320 bits to 64 bits. This mapping is locally specific to the router port and the connecting hosts/router ports. Specifically written for use on low bandwidth links (less than T1 or 1.544Mbps), IPv6 AMP’s applicability goes to integration of cellular/WiFi appliances and will be critical for tactical uses for military and first responder applications.</description>
