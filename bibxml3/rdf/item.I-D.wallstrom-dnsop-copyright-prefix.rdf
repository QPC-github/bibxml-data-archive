    <description>The content of a typical zone file is lacking information on the copyright and license from which the content of the zone file is available.  The typical use is to make a zone file available after an agreement on use (license) has been made.  When the zone file is publicly available through DNS, there is no way of signalling the copyright ownership or any end user license of the content.  This document describes two prefixes for handling this using the TXT RR type, _copyright and _license.</description>
