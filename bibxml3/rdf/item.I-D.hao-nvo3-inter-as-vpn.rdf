    <description>This draft describes the solution of vanilla inter-as option-B connection between NVO3 network and MPLS/IP VPN network through centralized NVE-NVA architecture. The ASBR located in NVO3 network is called ASBR-d, NVO3 tunnel and MPLS tunnel stitching should be performed on the ASBR-d. No distributed BGP VPN protocol (RFC4364) is running between NVEs and ASBR-d in NVO3 network, NVEs and ASBR-d are controlled by centralized NVA.</description>
