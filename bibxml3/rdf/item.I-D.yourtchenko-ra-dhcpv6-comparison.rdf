    <title>"A comparison between the DHCPv6 and RA based host configuration", Andrew Yourtchenko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yourtchenko-ra-dhcpv6-comparison-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document attempts to make a balanced comparison between the RA- based and DHCPv6-based host configuration mechanisms.  It compares the two on different aspects, e.g: underlying media assumptions, coordination, locality, etc.  and highlights the strong and weak sides of both protocols for each scenario.</description>
