    <description>This memo specifies a protocol for transferring invoices automatically between companies. The receiver can read invoice data automatically into accounts payables and possibly into approval work flow. This eliminates the costly and error-prone manual typing of invoice data. Main design goal was simplicity in order to make implementation easy. The parties involved identify themselves using e-mail addresses, which makes addressing simple and flexible.</description>
