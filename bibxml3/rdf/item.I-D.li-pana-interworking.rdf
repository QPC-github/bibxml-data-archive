    <title>"Interworking of PANA and 802.1X", Li Hongyu, Ruobin Zheng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-pana-interworking-00.txt</link>
    <description>EAP is a lower layer dependant protocol that has 802.1X and PANA to carry it over link layer and network layer respectively. 802.1X cannot go through any nodes, while PANA can carry EAP through the network over network layer. 802.1X is popular on legacy terminals, but it is painful to upgrade all these terminals to support PANA. This document introduces a PANA interworking function that enables legacy 802.1X terminals get authentication and access to PANA network without upgrading its software or hardware.</description>
