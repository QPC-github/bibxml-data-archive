    <title>"Two-Stage IETF Standardization", Spencer Dawkins, Dave Crocker, Eric Burger, Peter Saint-Andre</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crocker-ietf-twostage-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 2026 specifies a three-stage Standards Track.  As currently practiced, IETF standards track documents typically attain only the first stage.  This proposal discusses the problems caused by the disparity between documented procedures and actual practice, and proposes a simplified, two-step standard track, which will streamline the IETF standardization process, with distinct benefits for each stage.  Clarification of the criteria for handling documents re- submitted as Proposed Standard is also provided.</description>
