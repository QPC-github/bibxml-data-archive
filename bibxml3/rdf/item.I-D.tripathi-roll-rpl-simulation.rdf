    <description>This document presents a performance evaluation of the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for a small outdoor deployment of sensor nodes and for a large scale smart meter network. Detailed simulations are carried out to produce several routing performance metrics using these real-life deployment scenarios. Please refer to the pdf version of this document, which includes several plots for the performance metrics not shown in the txt version.  note</description>
