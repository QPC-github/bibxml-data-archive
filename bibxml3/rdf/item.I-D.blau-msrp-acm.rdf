    <title>"An Alternative Connection Model for the Message Session Relay Protocol  (MSRP)", Staffan Blau, Christer Holmberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blau-msrp-acm-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs. The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975 and RFC4976, in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it comes to conveying endpoint address information, and also uses mainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal instead of using MSRP relays.</description>
