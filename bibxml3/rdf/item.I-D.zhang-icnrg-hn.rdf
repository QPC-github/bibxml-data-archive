    <description>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds of information including resources, services and data. With many proposals of novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA, ICN NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content based ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information naming schemes are adopted in different network proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The proposed naming scheme using a hybrid naming structure, including hierarchical components, and the properties of the component assembly plane. The hybrid naming (hn) scheme enables to identify different routing information uniformly, and provides many great advantages, such as high aggregation, limited length, suffix holes remission, fuzzy matching support, high security and good compatibility with IPv4/IPv6, DONA, CCN/NDN and so on.</description>
