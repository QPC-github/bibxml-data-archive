    <title>"Resources for Preferred Path Routes in IGPs", Uma Chunduri, Renwei Li, Kevin Smith</title>

    <description>Preferred Path Routing (PPR) is concerned with setting up the route for a given prefix as specified in the path description along with a corresponding data plane/forwarding identifier PPR-ID.  This document specifies an extension to PPR, a mechanism to perform resource reservations nodes on Preferred Path Routes (PPR) for IGPs (IS-IS, OSPFv2, OSPFv3).  This is done by specifying the resources that need to be reserved along the path using PPR path attributes.</description>
