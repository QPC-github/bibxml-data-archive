        <description>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end- to-end interpersonal messaging.  These include, but are not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key handling (including peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices).  Human Rights-enabling principles like Data Minimization, End-to-End and Interoperability are explicit design goals.  For the goal of usable privacy, pEp introduces means to verify communication between peers and proposes a trust-rating system to denote secure types of communications and signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level. Significantly, the pEp protocols build on already available security formats and message transports (e.g., PGP/MIME with email), and are written with the intent to be interoperable with already widely- deployed systems in order to ease adoption and implementation.  This document outlines the general design choices and principles of pEp.</description>
