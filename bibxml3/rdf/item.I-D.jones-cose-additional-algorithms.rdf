    <description>The W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification and the FIDO2 Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) specification use COSE algorithm identifiers.  This specification registers algorithms in the IANA "COSE Algorithms" registry that are used by WebAuthn and CTAP implementations that are not already registered.  Also, they are registered in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry, when not already registered there.</description>
