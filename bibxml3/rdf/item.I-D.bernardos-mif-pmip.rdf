    <description>The IETF standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi- homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.  The IETF is working on optimizations for PMIPv6.  While multi-homing item has been proposed to be part of the approved work, discussions showed there are still many controversial issues to be addressed (i.e. the no-host modification theorem).  This document explores solutions for the multi-homing use case aiming at helping PMIPv6 development where possible.</description>
