    <description>IKEv2 does not allow secure peer authentication when using short credential strings, i.e. passwords.  Several proposals have been made to integrate password-authentication protocols into IKE.  This document provides an adaptation of PACE (Password Authenticated Connection Establishment) to the setting of IKEv2 and demonstrates the advantages of this integration.</description>
