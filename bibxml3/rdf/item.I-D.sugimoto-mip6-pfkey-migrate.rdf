    <title>"PF_KEY Extension as an Interface between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE", Shinta  Sugimoto, Francis Dupont, Masahide Nakamura</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sugimoto-mip6-pfkey-migrate-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork.  We propose a set of extensions to the PF_KEY framework which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment.  The first extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE and is for migrating the endpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair in tunnel mode.  The second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKE to make the right choice for address selection in bootstrapping process.  Both extensions are helpful for assuring smooth interworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achieving performance optimization.</description>
