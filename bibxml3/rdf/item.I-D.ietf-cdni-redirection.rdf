    <title>"Request Routing Redirection interface for CDN Interconnection", Ben Niven-Jenkins, Ray van Brandenburg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cdni-redirection-20.txt</link>
    <description>The Request Routing Interface comprises (1) the asynchronous advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream Content Delivery Network (CDN) that allows an upstream CDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that downstream CDN; and (2) the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting whether a downstream CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of a downstream CDN responding with how to actually redirect the user request.  This document describes an interface for the latter part, i.e., the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface.</description>
