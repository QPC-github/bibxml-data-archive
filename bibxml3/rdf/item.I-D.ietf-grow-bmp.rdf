    <title>"BGP Monitoring Protocol", John Scudder, Rex Fernando, Stephen Stuart</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-grow-bmp-17.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a protocol, BMP, that can be used to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for obtaining route views.  Prior to introduction of BMP, screen-scraping was the most commonly-used approach to obtaining such views.  The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</description>
