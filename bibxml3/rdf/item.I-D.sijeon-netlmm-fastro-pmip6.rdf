    <title>"Fast Route Optimization for PMIPv6 handover", Seil Jeon, Younghan Kim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sijeon-netlmm-fastro-pmip6-00.txt</link>
    <description>To solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a variety of mechanisms were proposed. The mechanism was also proposed to support PMIPv6 RO handover according mobile node's movements. Efficient PMIPv6 RO handover SHOULD be considered to reduce handover latency and to support communication with route optimization disabled mobile node's remote node. In this draft, we proposed a mechanism that can solve handover latency in PMIPv6 RO handover. And we introduce a few of messages to apply proposed mechanism.</description>
