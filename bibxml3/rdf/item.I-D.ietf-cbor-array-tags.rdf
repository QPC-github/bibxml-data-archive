    <title>"Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Typed Arrays", Carsten Bormann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cbor-array-tags-08.txt</link>
    <description>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.  The present document makes use of this extensibility to define a number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as two additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.</description>
