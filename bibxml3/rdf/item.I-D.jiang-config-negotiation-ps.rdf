    <description>This document describes a problem statement and general requirements for distributed autonomic configuration of multiple aspects of networks, in particular carrier networks.  The basic model is that network elements need to negotiate configuration settings with each other to meet overall goals.  The document describes a generic negotiation behavior model.  The document also reviews whether existing management and configuration protocols may be suitable for autonomic networks.</description>
