    <description>Future 5G networks will not make a clear distinction between fronthaul and backhaul transport networks, because varying portions of radio access network functionality might be moved toward the network as required for cost reduction and performance increase. This will pose additional challenges on the transport network, driving for a new design of integrated fronthaul and backhaul, usually referred to as crosshaul.  This document present the crosshaul architecture framework being developed by the EU 5G-Crosshaul project, as well as identifies several key requirements for the transport network, with the goal of fostering discussion at the DETNET WG.</description>
