        <description>Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate the network. Intent-based management system includes an interface for users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration and manage their life-cycle.  This document discusses mostly the concept of network intents, but other types of intents are also being considered. Specifically, it highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and encode intent, the associated intent taxonomy, and defines relevant intent terms where necessary. This document provides a foundation for intent related research and facilitates solution development.
