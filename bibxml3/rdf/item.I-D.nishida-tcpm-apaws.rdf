    <description>This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can provide protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS.  While PAWS requires TCP to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP connection, A-PAWS supports the same feature without using timestamps.  A-PAWS is designed to be used complementary with PAWS. TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary and activates A-PAWS only when it is safe to use.  Without impairing the reliability and the robustness of TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP extensions.</description>
