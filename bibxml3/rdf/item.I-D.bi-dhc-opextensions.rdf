    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bi-dhc-opextensions-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new option that can be used by DHCP servers to exchange with DHCP clients specific security configuration information.  This new options also defines a standard parameter format and code so that there will be no ambiguity in interoperating the information being exchanged and that there will be no issues related to interoperability.  It also defines some other options that may be used in enterprise networks but not included in [RFC2132].</description>
