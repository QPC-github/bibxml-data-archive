    <description>Targeted LDP (t-LDP) Hellos are used for establishing adjacencies with non-directly connected peers.  After an LDP session is established to a Targeted Peer, there are deployment scenerios where it is not necessary to send Targeted LDP Hellos at the configured intervals.  This document proposes a mechanism to turn off or reduce the rate of exchange of Targeted LDP Hellos after LDP session is established to a peer.</description>
