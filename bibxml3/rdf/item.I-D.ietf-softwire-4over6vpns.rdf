    <title>"IPv4 unicast/multicast VPNs over an IPv6 core", Greg Shepherd</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-softwire-4over6vpns-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider with an IPv6 backbone may provide VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and MVPNs (Multicast Virtual Private Networks) for its IPv4 customers. The IPv6 core network need only deploy native multicast services using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) . All additional functionality described is Customer Edge (CE) based and there are no additional Provider (P) or Provider Edge (PE) protocols.</description>
