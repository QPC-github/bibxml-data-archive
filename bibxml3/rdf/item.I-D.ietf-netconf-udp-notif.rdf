        <description>This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism to collect data from networking devices.  A shim header is proposed to facilitate the data streaming directly from the publishing process on network processor of line cards to receivers.  The objective is to provide a lightweight approach to enable higher frequency and less performance impact on publisher and receiver processes compared to already established notification mechanisms.</description>
