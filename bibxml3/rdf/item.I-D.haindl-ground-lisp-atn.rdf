    <description>This document describes the use of the LISP architecture and protocols to address the requirements of the worldwide Aeronautical Telecommunications Network with Internet Protocol Services, as articulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization.  The ground-based LISP overlay provides mobility and multi-homing services to the IPv6 networks hosted on commercial aircrafts, to support Air Traffic Management communications with Air Traffic Controllers and Air Operation Controllers.  The proposed architecture doesn't require support for LISP protocol in the airborne routers, and can be easily deployed over existing ground infrastructures.</description>
