    <description>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol provides mobility management for an IPv4-only mobile nodes.  It provides network-based mobility management and session continuity for the IPv4 mobile node as long as the mobile node is attached to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  The mobile node that attaches to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, may also implement Mobile IPv4.  When a Mobile IPv4-capable mobile node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, there are some interactions between Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 that need to be studied. This document looks at a particular scenario where the mobile node transitions between using Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4.</description>
