    <description>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features. A feature may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, having a self-contained role. However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction- FI for short.  This document provides a description of the FI problem in Internet, the main problems to be solved in the FI resolution, and compares some solutions for FI identification and resolution explored that have been discussed in the literature.</description>
