    <title>"End-to-End Object Encryption and Signatures for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)", Matthew Miller, Carl Wallace</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-miller-xmpp-e2e-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines two methods for securing objects (often referred to as stanzas) for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), which allows for efficient asynchronous communication between two entities, each with might have multiple devices operating simultaneously.  One is a method to encrypt stanzas to provide confidentiality protection; another is a method to sign stanzas to provide authentication and integrity protection.  This document also defines a related protocol for entities to request the ephemeral session keys in use.</description>
