    <title>"Implications of Full-Duplex HTTP", Wenbo Zhu, Mike Jennings</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhu-http-fullduplex-08.txt</link>
    <description>Full-duplex HTTP follows the basic HTTP request-response semantics but also allows the server to send response body to the client at the same time when the client is transmitting request body to the server. Requirements for full-duplex HTTP are under-specified in the existing HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1) specification, and this memo intends to clarify the requirements of full-duplex HTTP on top of the basic HTTP protocol semantics.</description>
