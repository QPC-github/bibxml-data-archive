    <description>In SDN networks, applications need to discover the location of the local or specific SDN Orchestrator before requesting service.  Other SDN Orchestrator may also need to know its nearby SDN Orchestrators. This is called SDN Discovery.  This document introduces a discovery scheme which employs the U-NAPTR mechanism to determine the URI of the SDN Orchestrator.</description>
