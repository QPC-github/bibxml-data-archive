    <description>IPsec and SRTP use out-of-band key management. Synchronization of group security associations is an issue when out-of-band key management protocols are used. In case of rapid or unplanned rekeying, some members may not receive the key updates in time to decrypt the IPsec or SRTP traffic. To address that problem, this document describes a strawman proposal to carry group key updates as part of IPsec and SRTP.</description>
