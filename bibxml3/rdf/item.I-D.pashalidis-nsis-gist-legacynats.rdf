    <title>"GIST Legacy NAT Traversal", Andreas Pashalidis, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pashalidis-nsis-gist-legacynats-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension to the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol that enables the protocol to traverse different types of Network Address Translator (NAT). These NATs are assumed to not support GIST, i.e. to be "legacy" NATs. The purpose of this extension is to enable GIST hosts to correctly interpret signalling messages with respect to the data traffic they refer to, in the presence of such NATs. Note that this extension does not require changes to the format of GIST messages; it merely requires some new behaviour for non-NAT GIST nodes.</description>
