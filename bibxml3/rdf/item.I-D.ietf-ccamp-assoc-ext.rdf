    <description>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) controlled label switched paths (LSPs).  In this context, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  This object also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate RSVP state, and this document defines how the ASSOCIATION object can be more generally applied.  This document also defines Extended ASSOCIATION objects which, in particular, can be used in the context of the Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).  This document updates RFC 2205, RFC 3209, and RFC 3473. It also generalizes the definition of the Association ID field defined in RFC 4872.</description>
