    <title>"Routing Loop Attack using IPv6 Automatic Tunnels: Problem Statement and Proposed Mitigations", Gabi Nakibly, Fred Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nakibly-v6ops-tunnel-loops-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in- IPv4 automatic tunnels.  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take advantage of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6 routing state and the native IPv6 routing state.  The attack forms a routing loop which can be abused as a vehicle for traffic amplification to facilitate DoS attacks.  The first aim of this document is to inform on this attack and its root causes.  The second aim is to present some possible mitigation measures.</description>
