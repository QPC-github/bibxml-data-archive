        <description>This document specifies the format and contents of data escrow deposits targeted primarily for Industrial Internet Identifier Node (IIIN) which provides identifier registration. However, this specification was designed to be independent of the underlying objects that are being escrowed, therefore it could be used for purposes other than IIIN.</description>
