    <title>"A Mechanism to Measure the Quality of a Point-to-point Route in a Low Power and Lossy Network", Mukul Goyal, Emmanuel Baccelli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-goyal-roll-p2p-measurement-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a mechanism that enables an RPL node to measure the quality of an existing route to/from another RPL node in a low power and lossy network, thereby allowing the node to decide if it wants to initiate the discovery of a more optimal route.</description>
