    <title>"Signaling MSD (Maximum SID Depth) using OSPF", Jeff Tantsura, Uma Chunduri</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tantsura-ospf-segment-routing-msd-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a way to expose Maximum SID Depth (MSD) supported by a node at node and/or link level by an OSPF Router.  In a Segment Routing (SR) enabled network a centralized controller that programs SR tunnels at the head-end node needs to know the MSD information at node level and/or link level to push the label stack of an appropriate depth .  Here the term OSPF means both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</description>
