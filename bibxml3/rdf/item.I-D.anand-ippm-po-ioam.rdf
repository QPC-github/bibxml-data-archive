    <description>This document proposes a way to extend in-situ OAM techniques to include operational data from multiple network layers with a view to create an integrated record of OAM information as the data flows between two network entities. An instance of this technique that is elaborated here focuses on packet-optical networks that are traditionally transport centric. The mechanisms described are general enough to allow future extensibility of in-situ OAM techniques into other non-packet domains.</description>
