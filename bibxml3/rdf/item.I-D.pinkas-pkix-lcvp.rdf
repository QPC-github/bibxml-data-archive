    <title>"Lightweight Certificate Validation Protocol (LCVP)", Denis Pinkas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pinkas-pkix-lcvp-02.txt</link>
    <description>LCVP allows a client to delegate certificate path validation to a trusted server. The path validation (e.g. making sure that none of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a set of rules called a validation policy. It allows simplification of client implementations and only uses of a set of predefined validation policies. This document defines a protocol that can be used to: (1) validate one certificate according to one validation policy, (2) query the validation policies supported by an LCVP server.</description>
