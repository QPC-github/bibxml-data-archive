    <title>"IS-IS Protocol Extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery", Jean-Louis Le Roux</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pce-disco-proto-isis-08.txt</link>
    <description>There are various circumstances where it is highly desirable for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Path Computation Elements (PCEs), along with information that can be used by the PCC for PCE selection. When the PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating passively in the IGP, a simple and efficient way to announce PCEs consists of using IGP flooding. For that purpose this document defines extensions to the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within an IS-IS area or within the entire IS-IS routing domain.</description>
