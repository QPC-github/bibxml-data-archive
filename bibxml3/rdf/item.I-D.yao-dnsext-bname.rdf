    <description>This document defines a new DNS Resource Record called "BNAME", which provides the capability to map itself and its subtree of the DNS name space to another domain.  It differs from the CNAME record which only maps a single node of the DNS name space, from the DNAME which only maps the subtree of the DNS name space to another domain.</description>
