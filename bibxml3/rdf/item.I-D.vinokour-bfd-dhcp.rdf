    <title>"Configuring BFD with DHCP and Other Musings", Vitali Vinokour, David Ward</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vinokour-bfd-dhcp-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a method for configuring Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) by an IP Edge device using DHCPv4 or DHCPv6.  It provides motivation for the new functionality, defines new DHCP options to assist with the task and outlines the rules for configuring BFD on an IP endpoint for different network topologies. The document also discusses endpoint behavior upon BFD failure. Comments on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org.</description>
