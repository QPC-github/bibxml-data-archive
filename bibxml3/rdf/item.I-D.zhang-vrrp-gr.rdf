    <title>"Extending the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for Graceful Restart", Huihong Building, Dacheng Zhang</title>

    <description>Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwarding data packets during the restart of their control plains.  This functionality is called "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding". A router supporting graceful restart is able to provide more reliable packet forwarding service during system maintaining procedures and software-error recoveries.  This informational document analyzes the issues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introduces several candidate solutions.</description>
