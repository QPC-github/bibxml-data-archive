    <description>The NFS version 4 protocol provides a mechanism for a collection of NFS file servers to collaborate in providing an organization-wide file name space.  The DNS SRV RR allows a simple way for an organization to publish the root of its filesystem name space, even to clients that might not be intimately associated with such an organization.  The DNS SRV RR can be used to join these organization- wide file name spaces together to allow construction of a global, uniform NFS file name space.</description>
