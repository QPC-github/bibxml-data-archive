    <title>"Secure IoT Bootstrapping: A Survey", Mohit Sethi, Behcet Sarikaya, Dan Garcia-Carrillo</title>

    <description>This draft provides an overview of the various terms that are used when discussing bootstrapping of IoT devices.  We document terms that have been used within the IETF as well as other standards bodies.  We investigate if the terms refer to the same phenomena or have subtle differences.  We provide recommendations on the applicability of terms in different contexts.  Finally, this document presents a survey of secure bootstrapping mechanisms available for smart objects that are part of an Internet of Things (IoT) network.  The survey does not prescribe any one mechanism and rather presents IoT developers with different options to choose from, depending on their use-case, security requirements, and the user interface available on their IoT devices.</description>
