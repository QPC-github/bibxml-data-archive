    <title>"Framework for CDN Interconnection", Bruce Davie, Larry Peterson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-davie-cdni-framework-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI).  The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect CDNs.  CDN Interconnection requires the specification of several interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing, metadata exchange, and the acquisition of content by one CDN from another.  The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.</description>
