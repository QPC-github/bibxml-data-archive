    <title>"An Improvement of ECN to Enhance TCP Fairness Performance", Marcus Sun</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sun-tcpm-ecn-improvement-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes TCP fairness performance enhancement scheme by use of two parameters congestion degree and link idle rate. It uses IP header flag reserved field and ECN 2 bits field to form a new IP congestion and Spare Flag (ICSF) and uses 3bits of reserved bits in the TCP header to compose the TCP Congestion and Spare Flag (TCSF) field. This method identifies the congestion and link idle status to make sure that every TCP flow can receive the same degree of fairness and can improve TCP send window adjustment speed and transmission efficiency.</description>
