    <title>"The Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling Extensible Authentication  Protocol Method (EAP-FAST)", Joseph Salowey</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cam-winget-eap-fast-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) based Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) protocol. EAP-FAST is an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel. Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey authentication related data between the peer and the EAP server.</description>
