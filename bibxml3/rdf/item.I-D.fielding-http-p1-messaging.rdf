    <description>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990.  This document is Part 1 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, updates RFC 2616 and RFC 2617.  Part 1 provides an overview of HTTP and its associated terminology, defines the "http" and "https" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the generic message syntax and parsing requirements for HTTP message frames, and describes general security concerns for implementations.</description>
