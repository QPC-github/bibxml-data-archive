    <description>This document describes a Home Agent assisted Route Optimization functionality to IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol.  The function is designed to facilitate optimal routing in cases where all nodes are connected to a single Home Agent, thus the use case is Route Optimization within single organization or similar entity.  The functionality adds the possibility to discover eligible peer nodes based on information received from Home Agent, Network Prefixes they represent, and how to establish a direct tunnel between such nodes.</description>
