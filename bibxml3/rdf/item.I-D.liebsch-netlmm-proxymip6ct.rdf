    <title>"Context Transfer for Proxy MIPv6", Marco Liebsch, Christian Vogt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liebsch-netlmm-proxymip6ct-00.txt</link>
    <description>The IETF is specifying a protocol for network-based localized mobility management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management and de-registration into account. This document specifies how the IETF's Context Transfer Protocol, which is specified in RFC 4067, can be used with protocols for network-based mobility management, taking proactive and reactive handover scenarios into account. The protocol Proxy Mobile IPv6 is suitable to support network-based mobility management, which is the reference protocol solution for the integration of the context transfer mechanisms in this document.</description>
