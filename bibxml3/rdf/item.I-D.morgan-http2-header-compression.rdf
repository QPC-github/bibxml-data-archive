    <description>This specification defines the format and compression of HTTP header fields in HTTP/2.  The compression is based on EZFLATE, which is a token-based DEFLATE algorithm for secure compression within encrypted communication channels.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  Discussion of this draft takes place on the HTTPBIS working group mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org), which is archived at &lt;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/>.
