    <description>Maintaining reachability of an EID prefix despite the failures of ETRs is a key concern in the LISP architecture.  In this document, we first analyse this problem in comparison with traditional routing protocols.  Then, we explain how Internet Service Providers could offer a service that preserves the reachability of the LISP ETRs of their customers in case of failures.</description>
