    <title>"Gap Analysis for Layer and Technology Independent OAM Management in the Multi-Layer Environment", Yuji Tochio, Huub van Helvoort, Liang Xia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-txh-opsawg-lime-gap-analysis-03.txt</link>
    <description>This draft analyses the existing management plane OAM related works in different SDOs, against the key objectives of Layer Independent OAM Management (LIME), to find the gap between them.  The results can be used as the guidance for further work.  This gap analysis is not targeted at L0-L2 transport OAM in ITU-T, either technology specific or generic across those technologies.  Rather, it is intended to leverage knowledge from that domain for the benefit of developing generic layer independent OAM management for L3-L7 (and L2.5 MPLS OAM).</description>
