    <title>"Happy Eyeballs Extension for Multiple Interfaces", Gang Chen, Carl Williams, Dan Wing, Andrew Yourtchenko</title>

    <description>This memo proposes extensions to the Happy Eyeball's algorithm requirements defined in RFC6555 for use with the multiple provisioning domain architecture.  The Happy Eyeballs in MIF would make the selection process smoother by using connectivity tests over pre-filtered interfaces according to defined policy.  This would choose the best interface with an automatic fallback mechanism.</description>
