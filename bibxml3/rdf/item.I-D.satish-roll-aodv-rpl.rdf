    <description>Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Point-to-Point (P2P) traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  For that purpose, this document specifies a reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for hop-by-hop routing (storing mode) based on Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) based RPL protocol.  Two separate Instances are used to construct directional paths in case some of the links between source and target node are asymmetric.</description>
