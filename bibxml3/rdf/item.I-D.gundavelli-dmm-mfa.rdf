    <description>IP mobility protocols are designed to allow a mobile node to remain reachable while moving around in the network.  The currently deployed mobility management protocols are anchor-based approaches, where a mobile node's IP sessions are anchored on a central node.  The mobile node's IP traffic enters and exits from this anchor node and it remains as the control point for all subscriber services.  This architecture based on fixed IP anchors comes with some complexity and there is some interest from the mobile operators to eliminate the use of fixed anchors, and other residual elements such as the overlay tunneling that come with it.  This document describes a new approach for realizing a mobile user- plane that does not require fixed IP anchors.  The architectural- basis for this approach is the separation of control and user plane, and the use of programmability constructs of the user-plane for traffic steering.  This approach is referred to as, Mobility-aware Floating Anchor (MFA).</description>
