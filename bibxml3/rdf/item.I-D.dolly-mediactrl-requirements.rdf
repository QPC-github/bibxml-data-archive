    <description>This document addresses the communication between an application server and media server. The current work in SIPPING and XCON working groups show these logical entities but do not address the physical decomposition and the protocol between the entities. This document presents the requirements from a media server control protocol (MCP) that enables an application server to use a media server. It will address the aspects of announcements, IVR and conferencing media services.</description>
