    <title>"Delay Tolerant Network Management Protocol", Edward Birrane, Vignesh Ramachandran</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-dtnrg-dtnmp-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network Management Protocol (DTNMP).  The DTNMP provides monitoring and configuration services between managing devices and managed devices, some of which may operate on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links. The protocol is designed to minimize the number of transmitted bytes, to operate without sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and to function autonomously when there is no timely contact with a network operator.</description>
