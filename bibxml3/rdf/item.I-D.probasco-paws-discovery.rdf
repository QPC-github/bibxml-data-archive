    <title>"Protocol to Access White Space database: Discovery", Scott Probasco, Basavaraj Patil</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-probasco-paws-discovery-01.txt</link>
    <description>A white space master device needs to query a white space database and obtain information about available spectrum/channels prior to operation.  White space databases which contain information about available spectrum/channels are associated with a regulatory domain and hence specific to a country or region.  A white space master device needs to discover the relevant white space database(s) given its current location and the regulatory domain that it is operating in.  The white space database discovery is the preliminary step that a white space master device has to perform.</description>
