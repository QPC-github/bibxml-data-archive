    <description>This document describes a Transport for the Syslog Protocol, that uses the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  The DTLS protocol provides authentication and privacy services for SYSLOG applications.  This document describes how using DTLS to transport SYSLOG messages makes this protection possible in an interoperable way.  This transport is designed to meet the security and operational needs of network administrators, operate in environments where a datagram transport is preferred, and integrates well into existing public keying infrastructures.</description>
