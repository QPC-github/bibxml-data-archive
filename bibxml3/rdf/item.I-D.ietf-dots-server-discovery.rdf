    <description>This document specifies mechanisms to configure Distributed Denial of Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) clients with their DOTS servers. The discovery procedure also covers the DOTS Signal Channel Call Home.  Knowing the appropriate DOTS server for a given location can be useful to engage mitigation actions even in cases where the DOTS client cannot localize the attack, but only knows that some resources are under attack and that help is needed.</description>
