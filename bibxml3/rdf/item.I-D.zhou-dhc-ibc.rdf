    <title>"Securing DHCPv6 By Identity Based Cryptography", Sujing Zhou, Zhou Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhou-dhc-ibc-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides security methods based on identity based cryptography to protect DHCP messages.  Identity based cryptography is a special kind of public key cryptography.  Specifically, an authetication protocol based on IBS (identity based signature) algorithms is proposed.  A key distribution method adopting IBE ( identity based encryption) algorithms is also proposed, where key is used as a shared secret in calculating authentication information according to authentication protocol specified in RFC 3315.</description>
