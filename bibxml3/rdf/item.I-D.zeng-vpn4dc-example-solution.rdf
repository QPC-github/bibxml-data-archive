    <description>More and more service providers proposed VPN4DC requirements. That is how to maintain and manage the host-to-host connectivity through Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs) between an enterprise legacy VPN site and the virtual datacenter (VDC) in datacenter, including automated provisioning, monitoring, and so on[VPN4DC].  This document provides an example solution by prototyping experiment for VPN4DC auto-provision. This solution is focus on the network side and the DC Edge, the DC inside is out of scope.</description>
