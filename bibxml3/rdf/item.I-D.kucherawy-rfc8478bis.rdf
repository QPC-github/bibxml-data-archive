    <description>Zstandard, or "zstd" (pronounced "zee standard"), is a data compression mechanism.  This document describes the mechanism and registers a media type and content encoding to be used when transporting zstd-compressed content via Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).  It also registers a corresponding media type, content encoding, and structured syntax suffix.  Despite use of the word "standard" as part of its name, readers are advised that this document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is being published for informational purposes only.  This document replaces and obsoletes RFC 8478.</description>
