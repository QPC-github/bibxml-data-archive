        <description>The goal of this document is to summarize current standardization efforts in the IETF ALTO working group to support important multi- domain use cases and show how they can benefit from network information exposure using ALTO.  Besides, key design requirements of network information exposure to support multi-domain use cases are also presented along with information about novel mechanisms and abstractions to improve the base ALTO framework in multi-domain scenarios.</description>
