    <title>"EAP Mutual Cryptographic Binding", Sam Hartman, Margaret Wasserman, Dacheng Zhang</title>

    <description>As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server.  EAP extensions such as channel binding or network posture information are often carried in tunnel methods; peers are likely to rely on this information.  RFC 3748 is a facility that protects tunnel methods against man-in-the-middle attacks.  However, cryptographic binding focuses on protecting the server rather than the peer.  This memo explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected from man-in- the-middle attacks and recommends mutual cryptographic binding, a new form of cryptographic binding that protects both peer and server along with other mitigations.</description>
