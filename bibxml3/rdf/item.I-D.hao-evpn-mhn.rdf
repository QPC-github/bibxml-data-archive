    <description>To enhance the reliability, bridged network is normally multi-homed to an EVPN network, there are two categories of mechanisms to avoid the layer 2 traffic loop. The first category does not require the PEs participating in the control protocol of the bridged network, while the second category requires that. [EVPN] described one of the first category mechanisms called  designated forwarder (DF) election to achieve loop avoidance and vlan-based load balancing. This draft mainly focuses on the second category of mechanisms which can achieve intra-vlan MAC-based load balancing. MAC-based VLAN balancing is more applicable than DF election mechanism if all end stations in bridged network are on the same VLAN which can cause traffic congestion in DF link.</description>
