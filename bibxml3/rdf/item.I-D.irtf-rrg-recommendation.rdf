    <description>It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multihoming, and inter-domain traffic engineering.  This document presents, as a recommendation of future directions for the IETF, solutions which could aid the future scalability of the Internet.  To this end, this document surveys many of the proposals that were brought forward for discussion in this activity, as well as some of the subsequent analysis and the architectural recommendation of the chairs.  This document is a product of the Routing Research Group.</description>
