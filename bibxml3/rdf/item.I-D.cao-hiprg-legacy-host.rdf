    <title>"Communication between a HIP-enabled Host and a Legacy Host", Zehn Cao, Feng Cao, Hui Deng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-hiprg-legacy-host-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a way to support a HIP-enabled host to have the ability to communicate with legacy hosts.  By leveraging a proxy to bridge the communication between HIP host and non-HIP hosts, this document does not need the extensions to the HIP protocol.</description>
