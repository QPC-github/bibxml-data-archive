    <description>Let us consider an Information Centric Networking (ICN) solution, in which an End Node requests for a content sending "content requests" (or "interest packets").  The content is provided back to the requestor by the "origin" node or by an intermediate node that had cached the content.  The content is usually divided into "chunks" that can be individually requested, sent back to the requester, cached into intermediate nodes.  The sending rate of content requests can be adjusted in order to perform congestion control, implementing a receiver driven transport protocol.  As it can be useful to have large chunks (significantly larger than the Maximum Tranfer Unit across the network), the trasport protocol should also be used to further segment the chunks rather than relying to IP fragmentation. In this memo we define a receiver driven trasport protocol for ICN, which relies on the CONET ICN solution described in a companion draft.</description>
