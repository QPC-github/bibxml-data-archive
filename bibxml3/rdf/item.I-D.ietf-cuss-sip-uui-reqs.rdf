    <title>"Problem Statement and Requirements for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in SIP", Alan Johnston, Laura Liess</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-cuss-sip-uui-reqs-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces the transport of call control related User to User Information (UUI) using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and develops several requirements for a new SIP mechanism. Some SIP sessions are established by or related to a non-SIP application.  This application may have information that needs to be transported between the SIP User Agents during session establishment. In addition to interworking with the ISDN UUI Service, this extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints requiring application UUI.</description>
