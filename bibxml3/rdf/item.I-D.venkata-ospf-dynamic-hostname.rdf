    <description>Currently, there does not exist a simple and dynamic mechanism for routers running OSPF to learn about symbolic hostnames just like for routers running IS-IS.  This document defines a new OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV which allows the OSPF routers to flood their hostname-to-Router ID mapping information across the OSPF network. This mechanism is applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</description>
