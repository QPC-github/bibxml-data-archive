    <description>An end-to-end email security solution is proposed by implementing both DANE and DMARC protocols.  DMARC enables the recipient's mail server, with a method to verify the sender's ingenuity.  DANE intends to mitigate the MITM attack, by enabling the sender a method to authenticate the recipient's mail domain.  DANE and DMARC therefore complement each other by allowing the sender to verify the recipient's domain, and the recipient to verify the sender's address respectively.</description>
