    <title>"Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP)", Ambarish Malpani</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-scvp-33.txt</link>
    <description>SCVP allows a client to delegate certification path construction and certification path validation to a server. The path construction or validation (e.g., making sure that none of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a validation policy, which contains one or more trust anchors. It allows simplification of client implementations and use of a set of predefined validation policies.</description>
