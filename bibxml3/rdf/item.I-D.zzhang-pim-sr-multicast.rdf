    <description>With Segment Routing (SR) architecture [rfc8402], a unicast flow can be routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified in the packet, w/o the need for per-flow state in the network.  As a result, the otherwise needed protocols to signal the per-flow unicast state can also be removed from the network.  This document discusses options for multicast in an SR network.</description>
