    <title>"Extending the Bundle Protocol with Relative Time and Hops to Live", Daniel Ellard</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ellard-dtnrg-reltime-htl-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft presents two extensions to the DTN bundle protocol.  The first extension is the use of relative time rather than absolute time to address situations where the DTN nodes cannot achieve loosely synchronized clocks, as required by the current DTN bundle protocol. The second extension is the addition of a "hops-to-live" field to the bundle header, which specifies how many node-to-node hops each instance of a bundle is permitted to make before it expires.  These two extensions are separable; either may be used independently of the other.  Used together, however, they provide a powerful way to constrain resources consumed by the handling of a DTN bundle despite the absence of synchronized clocks or the presence of incomplete knowledge of the network topology (which may lead to the presence of hazards such as routing loops).</description>
