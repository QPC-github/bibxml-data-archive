    <title>"Spam reporting using IMAP: SREP", Zoltan Ordogh, Alessandro Vesely</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ordogh-spam-reporting-using-imap-kleansed-00.txt</link>
    <description>This is the definition of an IMAP command for reporting spam.  Spam can be flagged using the $Junk and $NotJunk keywords.  Spam reporting is meant to correspond to a command to be run on the IMAP server, in order to tune filters and possibly mitigate further attempts.  This behavior can be obtained by moving message to a special folder that is being observed by the server.  Purpose  This is a cleanup of an existing draft and its sole purpose is to discuss whether its core is good for APPSAWG.</description>
