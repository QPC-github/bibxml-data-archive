    <title>"Using short-lived traffic keys for Routing Protocols", Manav Bhatia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bhatia-karp-short-lived-keys-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes a generic mechanism for deriving short-lived traffic keys from the longed-lived keys.  The long-lived key could be a preshared secret or a key obtained from some key management protocol.  The mechanism described in this draft can be used to implement key rollovers without requiring the participating routers to exchange any additional information.</description>
