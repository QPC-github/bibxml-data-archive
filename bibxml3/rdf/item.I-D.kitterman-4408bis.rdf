    <title>"Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-Mail, Version 1", D. Kitterman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kitterman-4408bis-01.txt</link>
    <description>E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways.  In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands.  This document describes version 1 of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protocol, whereby a domain may explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.</description>
