    <description>Edge TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) switches currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress TRILL switch by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or by the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) protocol. When an ingress TRILL switch receives a data frame whose destination address (MAC&amp;Label) that switch does not know, the data frame is flooded within the frame's Data Label across the TRILL campus.  This document describes the framework for using directory services to assist edge TRILL switches in reducing multi-destination frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus improving TRILL network scalability and security.</description>
