    <description>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that enables easy development of security-related services, such as for authentication or encryption.  It uses self-certifying keys based on domain names.  The domain name owner can be any actor involved in the handling of the data, such as the author's organization, a server operator or one of their agents.  The DOSETA Library provides a collection of common capabilities, including canonicalization, parameter tagging and key retrieval.  The DOSETA Signing Template creates common framework for a signature of data that are in a "header/content" form.  Defining the meaning of a signature is the responsibility of the service that incorporates DOSETA.  Data security is enforced through the use of cryptographic algorithms.</description>
