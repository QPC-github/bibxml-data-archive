    <title>"Extensions to OSPF to Support Mobile Ad Hoc Networking", Madhavi Chandra, Abhay Roy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ospf-manet-or-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-OR, includes a mechanism for link-local signaling, a OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes, and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates. It also provides a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANET networks.</description>
