    <description>An increasing proportion of multimedia communication applications, including real-time interactive voice and video, are transported over Wi-Fi networks (i.e., wireless local area networks following IEEE 802.11 standards) today.  It is therefore important to evaluate candidate congestion control schemes designed in the RMCAT Working Group over test cases that include Wi-Fi access links.  This draft serves such a purpose, and is complementary to [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test] and [I-D.draft-sarker-rmcat-cellular-eval-test-cases]</description>
