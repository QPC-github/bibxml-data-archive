    <description>Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a flexible protocol possible to use in a wide range of applications and network and system topologies.  This flexibility and the implications of different choices should be understood by any application developer using RTP. To facilitate that understanding, this document contains an in-depth discussion of the usage of RTP's multiplexing points; the RTP session and the Synchronisation Source Identifier (SSRC).  The document tries to give guidance and source material for an analysis on the most suitable choices for the application being designed.</description>
