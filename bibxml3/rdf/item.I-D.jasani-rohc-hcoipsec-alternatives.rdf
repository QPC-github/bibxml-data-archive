    <description>Header Compression over IPsec [HCOIPSEC], documents the work items needed to integrate hop-by-hop header compression algorithms with IPsec security associations. However, as a result of various discussions within the IETF, two alternative approaches to achieving HCoIPsec have emerged. This draft is intended to document the two alternatives, and help those involved with HCoIPsec development converge on one common approach for realizing HCoIPsec.</description>
