    <title>"An AS-based Inter-domain Routing Architecture for a Scalable Internet (AIRA)", Zhengzhou University</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liang-idr-aira-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a simple, incremental, autonomous system  (AS)-based inter-domain routing architecture to solve the scalability  problems of the Internet, by separation of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)  for identifying endpoints and Routing Identifiers (RIDs) for locating  endpoints in the Internet. The proposed architecture uses AS numbers  as RIDs so that global routing tables can grow only with of AS  numbers, thus avoiding the rapid growth driven by constantly  increasing IP prefixes.  This proposal was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the  Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop in October 2006.</description>
