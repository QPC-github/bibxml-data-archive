    <title>"Software-Defined Network (SDN) Use Case for Bandwidth on Demand Applications", Ping Pan, Lyndon Ong, Shane Amante</title>

    <description>Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in industry and research sectors to support the needs of selected customers needing high bandwidth point-to-point connections.  Without a standard interface for controlling the use of network resources, user applications and services are subject to limits of layering, security and interoperability across multiple vendors of network equipment.  In this document, we argue the necessity in providing network information to the applications, thereby enabling the applications to directly provision network elements associated with the relevant applications.</description>
