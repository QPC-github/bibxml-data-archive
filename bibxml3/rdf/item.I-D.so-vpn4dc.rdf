    <description>This contribution addresses service provider requirements to provide host-to-host connectivity through Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).  It describes the use cases and the characteristics of hosts in data centers automatically joining the L3VPN.  It specifies the requirements on how to maintain and manage such host-to-host connectivity through L3VPN, so that automated provisioning, monitoring, and reporting of the cloud services can be achieved.</description>
