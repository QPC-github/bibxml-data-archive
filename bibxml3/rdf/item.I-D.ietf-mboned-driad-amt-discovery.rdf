    <title>"DNS Reverse IP AMT (Automatic Multicast Tunneling) Discovery", Jake Holland</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mboned-driad-amt-discovery-13.txt</link>
    <description>This document updates RFC 7450 (Automatic Multicast Tunneling, or AMT) by modifying the relay discovery process.  A new DNS resource record named AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.  The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.  Other extensions and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also defined.</description>
