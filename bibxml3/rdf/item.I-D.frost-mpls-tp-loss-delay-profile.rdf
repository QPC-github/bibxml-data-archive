    <title>"A Packet Loss and Delay Measurement Profile for MPLS-based Transport Networks", Dan Frost, Stewart Bryant</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-frost-mpls-tp-loss-delay-profile-00.txt</link>
    <description>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX.  This document describes a profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.  [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF consensus.]</description>
