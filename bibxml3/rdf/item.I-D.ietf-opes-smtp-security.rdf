    <title>"Integrity, privacy and security in OPES for SMTP", Martin Stecher</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-opes-smtp-security-03.txt</link>
    <description>The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework is application agnostic. Application specific adaptations extend that framework. Previous work has focused on HTTP and work for SMTP is in progress. These protocols differ fundamentally in the way data flows and it turns out that existing OPES requirements and IAB considerations for OPES need to be reviewed with regards to how well they fit for SMTP adaptation. This document analyzes aspects about the integrity of SMTP and mail message adaptation by OPES systems and privacy and security issues when the OPES framework is adapted to SMTP and lists requirements that must be considered when creating the "SMTP adaptation with OPES" document. The intent of this document is to capture this information before the current OPES working group shuts down. This is to provide input for subsequent working groups or individual contributors that may pick up the OPES/SMTP work at a later date.</description>
