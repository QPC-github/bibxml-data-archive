    <description>Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined as consistent sets of network configuration information.  This allows hosts to manage connections to multiple networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home router provides connectivity through both a broadband and cellular network provider.  This document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs through a Router Advertisement (RA) option.  This RA option announces a PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between PvDs.  The option can directly carry some information about a PvD and can optionally point to additional PvD information that can be retrieved using HTTP over TLS.</description>
