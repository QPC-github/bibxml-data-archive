    <title>"A Suggested Scheme for DNS Resolution of Networks and Gateways", Edward  Warnicke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-warnicke-network-dns-resolution-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document suggests a method of using DNS to determine the network that contains a specified IP address, the netmask of that network, and the address(es) of first-hop routers(s) on that network. This method supports variable length subnet masks, delegation of subnets on non-octet boundaries, and multiple routers per subnet.</description>
