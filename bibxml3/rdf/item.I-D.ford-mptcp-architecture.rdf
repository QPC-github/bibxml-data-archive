    <description>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the nature of TCP/IP restricts communications to a single path per socket. Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were these multiple paths able to be used concurrently.  This should enhance user experience through improved resilience to network failure and higher throughput.  This document outlines architectural guidelines for the development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these architectural components come together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol.  This document also lists certain high level design decisions that provide foundations for the MPTCP design, based upon these architectural requirements.</description>
