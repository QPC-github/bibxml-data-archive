    <title>"Using Labels With DNS-Based Service Discovery, mDNS, and DNS", Andrew Sullivan</title>

    <description>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Different name systems use different conventions for the characters allowed in any name.  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems are in use, it is important to follow a common set of conventions for naming.  This memo presents a convention for maximizing such interoperability.</description>
