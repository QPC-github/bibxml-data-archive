    <description>This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms that are probably fit for ALTO. Specifically it discusses those mechanisms for authentication, encryption and attack-preventing. The goal of this draft is to list and analyze the existing security mechanisms, and to explore suitable solutions to guarantee the security of ALTO protocol. This draft is a very early draft to outline the possible security mechanisms and leaves considerable contents and details to be added later.</description>
