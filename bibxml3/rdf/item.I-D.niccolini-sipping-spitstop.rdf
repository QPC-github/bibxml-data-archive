    <title>"Signaling TO Prevent SPIT (SPITSTOP) Reference Scenario", Saverio Niccolini, Jan Seedorf</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-niccolini-sipping-spitstop-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo discusses the need for standards that support SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) prevention applications.  After explaining the general need for SPIT prevention applications the memo provides a reference scenario for potential communication between entities that may be involved in SPIT prevention.  Within this scenario the need for standardizing communication is analyzed for each pair of communicating entities.  The analysis is intended to serve as a starting point for discussing the requirements for signaling standards as well as for architectural considerations, that support SPIT prevention applications.  This memo is not intended to suggest any solution of SPIT signaling issues.  Such work, if necessary at all, should be object of separate documents.</description>
