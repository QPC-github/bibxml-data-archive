    <title>"Indicating Service Retargeting in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", John Elwell, Francois Audet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-sipping-service-retargeting-00.txt</link>
    <description>This contains motivation, requirements and a proposed solution for indicating service retargeting information in SIP requests and responses. Retargeting of a request can be considered to be service retargeting when it goes beyond "normal" routing and might be of interest to applications at the UAS or UAC.</description>
