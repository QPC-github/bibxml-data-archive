    <description>This document specifies optional procedures for BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM signaling with controllers.  When P2MP tunnels used for BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM are to be signaled from controllers, the controllers can learn tunnel information (identifier, root, leaf) by participating BGP-MVPN and EVPN BUM signaling, instead of relying on ingress PEs to collect the information and then pass to the controllers. Additionally, Inclusive/Selective PMSI Auto Discovery Routes can be originated from controllers based on central provisioning, instead of from PEs based on local provisioning.</description>
