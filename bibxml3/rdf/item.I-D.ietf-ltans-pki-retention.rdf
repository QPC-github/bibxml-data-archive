    <description>In most PKIs, directory servers are used to provide current certificates and revocation information to relying parties. In situations where certificates must be validated relative to a time in the past, relying parties often have no means of obtaining the necessary PKI artifacts. This specification defines several directory attributes to support validation using historical PKI artifacts.</description>
