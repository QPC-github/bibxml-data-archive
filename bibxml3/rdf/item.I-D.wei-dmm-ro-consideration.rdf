    <description>Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) is designed to be a distributed and scalable mobility management solution, and providing optimal route for traffics is one of DMM's aims.  There have been several proposals on DMM framework, and this document provides discussion on how to optimize traffic routes, and aims to provide suggestioins on how to avoid long route in DMM network.</description>
