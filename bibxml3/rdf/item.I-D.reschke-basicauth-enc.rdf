    <title>"An Encoding Parameter for HTTP Basic Authentication", Julian Reschke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-reschke-basicauth-enc-08.txt</link>
    <description>The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on the locales they are running in. There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set, and even less interoperability for any characters beyond that.  This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic", specifying the server's character encoding expectation, using a new authentication scheme parameter.</description>
