        <description>This document sets guidelines for human rights considerations for developers working on network protocols and architectures, similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. This is an updated version of the guidelines for human rights considerations in [RFC8280].  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.  This informational document has consensus for publication from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Human Right Protocol Considerations Research Group.  It has been reviewed, tried, and tested by both by the research group as well as by researchers and practitioners from outside the research group.  The research group acknowledges that the understanding of the impact of internet protocols and architecture on society is a developing practice and is a body of research that is still in development.</description>
