    <description>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.  This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate two additional SDP capabilities.  In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media titles ("i=" line for each media) and media bandwidth ("b=" line).</description>
