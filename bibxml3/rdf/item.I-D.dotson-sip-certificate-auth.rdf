    <title>"Certificate Authentication in SIP", Steve Dotson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dotson-sip-certificate-auth-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines requirements for adding certificate authentication to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The use case addressed is that of a SIP device authenticating on behalf of configured users using a device certificate for purposes such as registration.  This document is being presented with the intention of providing requirements to any potential solutions specifying certificate authentication within SIP networks.  Supporting certificate authentication in SIP would provide strong authentication and increase the types of possible deployment scenarios.</description>
