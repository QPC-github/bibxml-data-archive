    <description>This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular,it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] provides provisioning capability for IPv4 and IPv6 tunnel by SNMP.  But it is not eqnough to support modern tunnel protocol such as 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].  The document describes extention of IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] to support 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].</description>
