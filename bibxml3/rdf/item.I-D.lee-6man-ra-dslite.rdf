    <title>"IPv6 RA Option for DS-Lite AFTR Element", Yiu Lee, Mohammed Boucadair, Xiaohu Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lee-6man-ra-dslite-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router Advertisement messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite AFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite traffic).  The provisioning of the AFTR address is crucial to access IPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context.  Means to ensure reliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is a must.  Furthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS- Lite serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without requiring a central knowledge of the underlying topology and deployed AFTRs.</description>
