    <title>"Source Specific support for Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast", Pierre Pfister</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pfister-pim-ssbidir-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document adds Source-Specific capabilities to the Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM-BIDIR) routing protocol. Similarly to PIM-BIDIR, multicast traffic is always forwarded to the RP Link, but packets are also filtered based on their source address and source-specific subscription state.  This operation mode is backwards compatible with PIM-BIDIR, provides a simpler alternative to PIM-SM and does not suffer when the multicast source location cannot be determined.</description>
