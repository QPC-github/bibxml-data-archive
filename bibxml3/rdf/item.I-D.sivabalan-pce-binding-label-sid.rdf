    <description>In order to provide greater scalability, network opacity, and service independence, SR utilizes a Binding Segment Identifier (BSID).  It is possible to associate a BSID to RSVP-TE signaled Traffic Engineering Label Switching Path or binding Segment-ID (SID) to Segment Routed (SR) Traffic Engineering path.  Such a binding label/SID can be used by an upstream node for steering traffic into the appropriate TE path to enforce SR policies.  This document proposes an approach for reporting binding label/SID to Path Computation Element (PCE) for supporting PCE-based Traffic Engineering policies.</description>
