        <description>Redundancy Protection is a generalized protection mechanism to achieve the high reliability of service transmission in Segment Routing network.  The mechanism inherits the "Live-Live" methodology, targeting to enhance the functionalities of Segment Routing over IPv6.  Inspired by DetNet Packet Replication and Packet Elimination functions, two new Segments are introduced to provide replication and elimination functions on specific network nodes by leveraging SRv6 Segment programming capabilities.</description>
