    <title>"ALTO Incremental Updates Using Server-Sent Events (SSE)", Wendy Roome, Y. Yang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-alto-incr-update-sse-22.txt</link>
    <description>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol provides network related information, called network information resources, to client applications so that clients can make informed decisions in utilizing network resources.  This document presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO server to push updates to ALTO clients, to achieve two benefits: (1) updates can be incremental, in that if only a small section of an information resource changes, the ALTO server can send just the changes; and (2) updates can be immediate, in that the ALTO server can send updates as soon as they are available.</description>
