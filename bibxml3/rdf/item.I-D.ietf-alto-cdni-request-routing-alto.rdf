        <description>The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework in RFC 6707 defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs to achieve multiple goals, including extending the reach of a given CDN.  A CDNI Request Routing Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) is needed to achieve the goals of a CDNI.  RFC 8008 defines the FCI semantics and provides guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is not specified.  This document defines a new Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service, called "CDNI Advertisement Service", that provides an implementation of the FCI, following the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.</description>
