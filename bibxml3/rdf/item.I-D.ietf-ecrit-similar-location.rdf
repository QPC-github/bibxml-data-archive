        <title>"A LoST extension to return complete and similar location info", Brian Rosen, Roger Marshall, Jeff Martin</title>

        <description>This document describes an extension to the LoST protocol of RFC 5222 that allows additional civic location information to be returned in a &lt;findServiceResponse&gt;.  This extension supports two use cases: First, when the input location is valid but lacks some Civic Address elements, the LoST server can provide a completed form.  Second, when the input location is invalid, the LoST server can identify one or more feasible ("similar") locations.  This extension is applicable when the location information in the &lt;findService&gt; request uses the Basic Civic profile as described in RFC 5222 or another profile whose definition provides instructions concerning its use with this extension.</description>
