    <description>Overlap signalling is a traditional feature in telecom network. RFC 3578 addresses how to implement it in a SIP network. It mainly introduce the method to carry subsequent dialed number in INVITE. But there are still some issues for it. This document gives a detailed discussion on another method based on INFO. It can be treated as a supplementary for RFC 3578.</description>
