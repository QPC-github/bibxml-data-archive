    <title>"eICP: Extended Internet Cache Protocol to support today's content-based cache exchange", Yunfei Zhang, Liwen Gui, Jin Peng, Christian Schmidt, Lin Xiao</title>

    <description>This draft proposes three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol in order to support today's content-based Internet environment.  Since the newly created PPSP protocol is especially designed for today's network condition, we will take its advantages here.  The three proposals are: (1) Embedding PPSP in ICP; (2) PPSP and ICP Co-existing in caches communication; (3) Using PPSP to replace ICP.</description>
