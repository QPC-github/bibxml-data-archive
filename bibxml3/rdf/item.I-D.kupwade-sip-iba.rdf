    <title>"Identity Based Authentication in the Session Initiation Protocol", Harsh  Patil, Dean Willis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kupwade-sip-iba-00.txt</link>
    <description>Session Initiation Protocol is the Internet Engineering Task Force's standard for multimedia communications in an IP network. Authentication in SIP has been a major concern and most of the existing authentication mechanisms in SIP are dependent on public key infrastructure (PKI) or shared secrets (passwords).This document proposes new authentication schemes in SIP using identity-based signature and signcryption schemes.  This approach provides security comparable to that of certificate-based authentication while preserving the operational simplicity of shared-secret techniques.</description>
