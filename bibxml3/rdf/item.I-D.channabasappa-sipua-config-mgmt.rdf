    <title>"Use Cases and Considerations for SIP Client Configuration and Management", Sumanth Channabasappa, Jean-Francois Mule</title>

    <description>This document provides use cases for the configuration and management of SIP-based devices (SIP client and applications) based on available IETF protocols and related methodologies. The use cases have been made generic enough to take into account common network topologies and requirements in SIP service deployments. Based on the use cases, we present a preliminary analysis of available IETF protocols that meet these requirements and highlight some of the limitations.</description>
