        <title>"DNS Transport over TCP - Operational Requirements", John Kristoff, Duane Wessels</title>
        <dc:date>2022-01-06T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document updates RFC 1123 and RFC 1536.  This document requires the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried over TCP on the Internet as a Best Current Practice.  This operational requirement is aligned with the implementation requirements in RFC 7766.  The use of TCP includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session.  The document also considers the consequences of this form of DNS communication and the potential operational issues that can arise when this Best Current Practice is not upheld.</description>
