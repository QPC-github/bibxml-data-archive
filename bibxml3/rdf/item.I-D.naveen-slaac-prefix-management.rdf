    <title>"IPv6 Stateless Prefix Management", Naveen Kottapalli</title>

    <description>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) provides a provision for the hosts to request for a specific IPv6 address and manage the same, whereas the StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) doesn't have such a provision.  Also, unavailability of DHCPv6 across all OS platforms has limited the IPv6 nodes to not use features like soliciting a prefix of desired length and lifetime, renewing, releasing / declining a prefix, etc.  This document proposes IPv6ND extensions for enabling SLAAC devices to solicit prefix information as a hint PIO in RS and other methods like renewing or releasing or declining a prefix without introducing any new ICMPv6 message or option types.</description>
