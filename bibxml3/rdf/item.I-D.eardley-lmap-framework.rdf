    <title>"A framework for large-scale measurements", Philip Eardley, Trevor Burbridge, Al Morton</title>

    <description>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols that coordinate interactions between the components.  The document presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements and discusses which elements could be standardised in the IETF.  It is intended to assist the discussions about the potential creation of the LMAP working group.</description>
