    <description>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions).  This document defines a solution to enforce Service Function Chaining (SFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network.  The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding (DiffForward): packets are classified and marked at the entry point of an SFC-enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per SFC map basis.</description>
