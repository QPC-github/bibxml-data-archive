    <title>"Use of Multipath with MPLS and MPLS-TP", Curtis Villamizar</title>

    <description>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks.  MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) performance cannot be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.  Using MPLS Entropy Labels (RFC6790), MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.</description>
