    <description>This memo describes an optional extension to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP, [RFC7252] and [RFC7959]) that allows matching of request blocks.  This primarily serves to transfer the security properties that Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP, [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]) provides for single requests to blockwise transfers.  The security of blockwise transfer in OSCOAP is reflected on in a dedicated section.</description>
