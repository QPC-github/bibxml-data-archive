    <title>"Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust", Jari Arkko, Ted Hardie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iasa2-trust-update-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo updates the process for selection of trustees for the IETF Trust.  Previously, the Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as part of an update of the structure of the Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA).  This memo specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.  This memo obsoletes RFC 4371.  The changes relate only to the selection of trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are today.</description>
