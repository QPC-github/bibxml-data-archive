    <title>"Trickle ICE: Incremental Provisioning of Candidates for the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Protocol", Eric Rescorla, Justin Uberti, Emil Ivov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rescorla-mmusic-ice-trickle-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol that allows ICE agents to send and receive candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete lists.  With such incremental provisioning, ICE agents can begin connectivity checks while they are still gathering candidates and considerably shorten the time necessary for ICE processing to complete.  The above mechanism is also referred to as "trickle ICE".</description>
