    <description>The Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration [2] is a useful protocol which allows a mobile node to get Internet access through multiple accesses simultaneously, in which case the mobile node would be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of addresses. It proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and use multiple care-of addresses with the Binding Identifier Mobility Option. This document describes a simple extension to Binding Identifier Mobility Option to allow mobile node to select the most wanted link for the ongoing service.</description>
