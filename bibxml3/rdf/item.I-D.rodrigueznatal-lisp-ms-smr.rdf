        <description>This document extends [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] to allow Map Servers to send SMR messages.  This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments that use LISP as a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant with [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].  In this use-case mapping updates do not come from ETRs, but rather from a centralized controller that pushes the updates directly to the Mapping System.  In such deployments, Map Servers will benefit from having a mechanism to inform directly (P)ITRs about updates in the mappings they are serving.  Although implementations of this extension exist, this extension is deprecated by [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] and it is being documented for informational purposes.  Newer implementations should look into [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] to support PubSub in LISP deployments.</description>
