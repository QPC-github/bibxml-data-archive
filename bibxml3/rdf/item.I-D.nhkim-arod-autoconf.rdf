    <title>"AROD: An address autoconfiguration with Address Reservation and Optimistic  Duplicated address detection for mobile ad hoc networks", Namhoon Kim</title>

    <description>Every node must configure its network interface with a unique address in order to communicate with other nodes. Having a centralized DHCP server that provides addresses to nodes, we can easily and automatically obtain addresses. However, in a mobile ad hoc network, difficulties exist in supporting address autoconfiguration due to the lack of the centralized servers. We therefore propose a distributed address autoconfiguration approach for a mobile ad hoc network using address reservation and optimistic Duplicated Address Detection. The reserved address helps to reduce the allocation latency, and the optimistic DAD guarantees the uniqueness of addresses with smaller communication overhead.</description>
