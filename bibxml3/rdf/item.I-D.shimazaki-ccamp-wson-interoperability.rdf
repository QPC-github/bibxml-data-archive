    <description>GMPLS protocol enabled network operator to setup optical path network rapidly and dynamically.  Recently, WSON [8] is standardized to achieve WDM core network.  However, it is difficult that all network equipment supports WSON protocol.  Therefore, interoperability between WSON and non-WSON nodes is needed to construct path network.  This document describes requirement for interoperability between WSON node and non-WSON nodes and functions that routing and signaling protocol should support.</description>
