    <description>This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to add an optional operational capability, that allows tagging and grouping of the nodes in an OSPF domain.  This allows simplification, ease of management and control over route and path selection based on configured policies.  This document describes an extension to the OSPF protocol to advertise per-node administrative tags.  The node- tags can be used to express and apply locally-defined network policies which is a very useful operational capability.  Node tags may be used either by OSPF itself or by other applications consuming information propagated via OSPF.  This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate per- node administrative tags to the OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocol.  It provides example use cases of administrative node tags.</description>
