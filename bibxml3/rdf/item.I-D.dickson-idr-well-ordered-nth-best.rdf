    <title>"Enhanced BGP Capabilities for Exchanging Additional Nth-Best Paths", Brian  Dickson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dickson-idr-well-ordered-nth-best-01.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix information, so as to permit multiple copies of a prefix, with different paths, to be announced and withdrawn.  This negotiated capability facilitates faster local (inter-AS) and global (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route- reflector behaviour, including eliminating persistent oscillations.  Additional prefix instances have a new wire format for updates and withdrawals, to control path selection.  Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS peering.  Author's Note  This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr.</description>
