    <title>"Issues with Private IP Addressing in the Internet", Anthony Kirkham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-grow-private-ip-sp-cores-07.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the potential problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally- routable addressing within the core of an SP network.  The discussion focuses on link addresses and to a small extent loopback addresses. While many of the issues are well recognised within the ISP community, there appears to be no document that collectively describes the issues.</description>
