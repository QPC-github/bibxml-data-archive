    <title>"Handover Key Hierarchy based on Extended Master Session Key (EMSK)  Derivation", Zhen Cao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-hoakey-hierarchical-hokey-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework supporting various authentication protocols known as EAP methods. To avoid a full EAP authentication exchange when there is a handover across EAP authenticators, a handover key hierarchy should be specified. This document specifies how to derive a handover key hierarchy from the Extended Master Session Key (EMSK). In our mechanism, both intra and inter-authenticator handovers can be supported.</description>
