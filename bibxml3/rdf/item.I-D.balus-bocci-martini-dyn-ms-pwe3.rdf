    <title>"Dynamic Placement of Multi Segment Pseudo Wires", Florin Balus</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-balus-bocci-martini-dyn-ms-pwe3-00.txt</link>
    <description>There is a requirement for service providers to be able to extend the reach of pseudo wires ( PW ) across multiple Public Switched Network domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point- to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi segment pseudo wire among a set of Provider Edge Routers.</description>
