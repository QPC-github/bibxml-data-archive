    <description>The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP) with global network address and multiplexing local network address. This AEIP with Network Address Multiplexing(AEIP NAM) can realize autonomy and extensibility with minimal cost.</description>
