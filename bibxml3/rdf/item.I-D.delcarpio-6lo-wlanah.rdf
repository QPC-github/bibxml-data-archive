    <description>IEEE 802.11 is an established Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology which provides radio connectivity to a wide range of devices.  The IEEE 802.11ah amendment defines a WLAN system operating at sub 1 GHz license-exempt bands designed to operate with low-rate/low-power consumption.  This amendment supports large number of stations and extends the radio coverage to several hundreds of meters.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported over 802.11ah using 6LoWPAN techniques.</description>
