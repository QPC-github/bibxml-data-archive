    <title>"Shimmed IPv4/IPv6 Address Network Translation Interface (SHANTI)", Brian  Carpenter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-carpenter-shanti-01.txt</link>
    <description>There is a pragmatic need for a packet-level translation mechanism between IPv4 and IPv6, for scenarios where no other mode of IPv4 to IPv6 interworking is possible.  The mechanism defined here uses a shim in both the translator and the IPv6 host to mitigate the problems introduced by stateless translation.</description>
