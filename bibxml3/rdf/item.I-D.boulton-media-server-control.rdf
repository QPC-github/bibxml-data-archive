    <description>This document describes a protocol for application deployment where the application logic and media processing are distributed. The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control mechanism between Application Servers and Media Servers. The motivation for this protocol is to provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a distributed, centralized conference system, as defined by the XCON work group of the IETF.</description>
