    <description>In the mobile backhaul network, the mobile service is sensitive to Bit Error Rate (BER).  When the BER value of the service exceeds the threshold, the cell site equipments will stop working and the mobile terminal users cannot obtain voice and data services anymore.  Now the mobile backhaul tends to be IP/MPLS network and MPLS TE LSP is used to bear the mobile service which may be encapsulated in PW or L3VPN end to end.  Then the ingress Label Switched Router (LSR) of the MPLS TE LSP needs to get information on BER along the path of the LSP.  This document proposes new extensions of RSVP-TE to advertise the BER measurement requirement of the specific LSP to all of the transit LSRs and the egress LSR, and to report the BER measurement result from any transit or egress LSR towards the ingress LSR.</description>
