    <title>"PMIPv6 and Network Mobility Problem Statement", Carlos Bernardos, Maria Calderon, Ignacio Soto</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bernardos-netext-pmipv6-nemo-ps-02.txt</link>
    <description>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement of hosts within the localized mobility domain.  A mobile network (commonly referred to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the network-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6 [I-D.ietf-netext-pd-pmip], but with some limitations.  This I-D describes what can be done with current standardized protocols, and describes the problem statement of fully supporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.</description>
