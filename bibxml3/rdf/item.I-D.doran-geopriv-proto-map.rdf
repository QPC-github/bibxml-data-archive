    <title>"A Common Framework for Location Protocols", Kevin Doran, Richard Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-doran-geopriv-proto-map-01.txt</link>
    <description>There are currently several protocols developed by different standards organizations that implement a basic design pattern where a client requests location from a location server and the server responds with location information.  This document defines the Common Location Interoperability Framework (CLIF), a general data model for such protocols, and describes how some existing geolocation protocols can be mapped into this unified model.</description>
