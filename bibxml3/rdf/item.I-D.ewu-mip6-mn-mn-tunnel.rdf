    <title>"Packet Tunneling for Route Optimization in MN-to-MN Communications", Eric  Wu</title>

    <description>Mobile IPv6 provides mobility support for mobile devices moving around the Internet. It specifies that when a mobile host wishes for peers to communicate directly to its visited location, that the peer send packets using a Routing Header, Type 2. Corresponding packets from the mobile use a Home Address option. When two moving devices communicate, they may wish to use a the most direct data path between their respective locations. Use of this direct data path incurs the cost of both Routing Header and Home Address Options, in each direction. This document provides a simple means of reducing this overhead.</description>
