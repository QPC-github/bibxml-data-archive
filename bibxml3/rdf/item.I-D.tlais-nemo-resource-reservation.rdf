    <description>Degradation or forced service termination may occur because of frequent handoffs that may occur within NEMO networks. This paper presents a resource reservation scheme aiming at supporting quality of service guaranty. We focus on a reservation protocol adapted to NEMO specifications. For doing so, we use a generic signaling protocol that may exploit advantages of both reservation protocols; IntServ and DiffServ.</description>
