    <title>"OCSP Digest Extension", Phillip Hallam-Baker, Rob Stradling</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hallambaker-ocspdigest-01.pdf</link>
    <description>The OCSP digest extension creates a strong cryptographic binding between an OCSP token and the certificate it asserts a status value for.  Support for the digest identifier extension permits a certificate issuer to employ a high assurance cryptographic digest function such as SHA2 to attest to the authenticity of their certificates in a fashion that is fully downwards compatible with legacy clients that only support SHA1.</description>
