    <title>"Accurate ECN Feedback in TCP", Mirja Kuehlewind, Richard Scheffenegger</title>

    <description>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an IP/TCP mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion to the end-points.  An ECN-capable receiver will feedback this information to the sender.  ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).  Recently new TCP mechanisms like ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate feedback information in the case where more than one marking is received in one RTT.</description>
