    <title>"A Framework for Consent-Based Communications in the Session Initiation  Protocol (SIP)", Jonathan Rosenberg, Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sipping-consent-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports communications across many media types, including real-time audio, video, text, instant messaging, and presence. In its current form, it allows session invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered from one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the recipient. Without such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used for malicious purposes, including spam and denial-of-service attacks. This document identifies a framework for consent-based communications in SIP.</description>
