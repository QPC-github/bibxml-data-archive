    <description>This document specifies the requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  This document is a product of a joint International Telecommunications Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T).  This work is based on two sources of requirements; MPLS and PWE3 architectures as defined by IETF, and packet transport networks as defined by ITU-T.  The requirements expressed in this document are for the behavior of the protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks out of which the MPLS transport profile is constructed.  The requirements are not implementation requirements.</description>
