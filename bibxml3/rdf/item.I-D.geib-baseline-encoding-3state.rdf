    <title>"Signaling 3 PCN states with baseline encoding", Ruediger Geib</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-geib-baseline-encoding-3state-00.txt</link>
    <description>Layer 2 transport services like MPLS offer only 2 states to encode ECN state, if DiffServ based Class of Service is operated.  Still, a mechanism by which PCN egress nodes can differentiate between the normal behaviour state, admission stop state control state and flow termination state, by using PCN marking of packets is desirable. This document describes how threshold and excess marking can be combined with PCN baseline encoding.  A minimalistic approach like the one described in the following has some obvious shortcomings. These shortcomings are also presented and discussed.  Currently, the aim of this document is to trigger experimentation feasability studies.  Standardisation will be pursued in the future based on the results of the studies.</description>
