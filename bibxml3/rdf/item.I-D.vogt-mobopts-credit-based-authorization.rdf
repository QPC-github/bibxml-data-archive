    <title>"Credit-Based Authorization for Mobile IPv6 Early Binding Updates", Christian  Vogt, Jari Arkko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vogt-mobopts-credit-based-authorization-00.txt</link>
    <description>The latency associated with Mobile IPv6's Return Routability test can have an adverse impact on delay-sensitive applications. Early Binding Updates mitigate this issue by already using a new care-of address in parallel with testing it. We propose and analyze a credit-based mechanism that prevents misuse of Early Binding Updates for amplified flooding attacks and discourages such misuse for non-amplified flooding attacks.</description>
