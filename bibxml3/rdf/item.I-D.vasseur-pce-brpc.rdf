    <description>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a domain is referred to as a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems) has been identified as a key requirement . This document specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) in order to compute such inter-domain shortest constraint paths along a determined sequence of domains, using a backward recursive path computation technique while preserving confidentiality across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different Service Providers.</description>
