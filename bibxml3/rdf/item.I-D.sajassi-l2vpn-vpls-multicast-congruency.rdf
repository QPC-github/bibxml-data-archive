    <description>The current VPLS multicast proposals based on multicast tree has several issues that are outlined in [BRIDGE-INTEROP]. These issues stems from the divergence of the multicast and unicast paths for a given VPLS instance in the MPLS/IP network. This draft describes a mechanism for building multicast and unicast paths that are congruent in order to address these issues.</description>
