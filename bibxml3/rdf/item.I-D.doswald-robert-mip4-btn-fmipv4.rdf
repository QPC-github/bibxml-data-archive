    <title>"Better Than Nothing Mobile IPv4 Fast Handovers", Alistair Doswald, Stephan  Robert</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-doswald-robert-mip4-btn-fmipv4-00.txt</link>
    <description>Proposed fast handover solutions for Mobile IPv4 depend on the presence of Foreign Agents (FA) in the networks between which the Mobile Node (MN) moves to ensure their operation.  However, in many situations the MN moves into networks without FAs.  This document proposes a solution that includes fast handover mechanisms involving a direct connection to the Home Agent (HA).  This solution is not a full fledged fast handover proposal, but rather a complement to RFC 4881: Low-Latency Handovers in Mobile IPv4, and RFC 4988: Mobile IPv4 Fast Handover.</description>
