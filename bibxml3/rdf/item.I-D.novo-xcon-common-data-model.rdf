    <title>"A Common Conference Information Data Model for Centralized Conferencing  (XCON)", Oscar Novo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-novo-xcon-common-data-model-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document collects, organizes, and describes the conference variables that have been introduced in various protocol drafts of the XCON and SIPPING working groups. The goal of this document is to allow the conference control protocols to use a unified common conference information data model for XCON. This document formally defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that represents the common conference information in a conferencing server. The information is modeled as a series of elements, each of which contains a set of children and attributes.</description>
