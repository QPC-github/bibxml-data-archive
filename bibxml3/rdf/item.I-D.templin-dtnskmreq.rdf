    <title>"DTN Security Key Management - Requirements and Design", Fred Templin, Scott Burleigh</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-templin-dtnskmreq-00.txt</link>
    <description>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.  These challenges render traditional security key management mechanisms infeasible since round trip delays may exceed the duration of communication opportunities.  This document therefore proposes requirements and outlines a design for security key management in DTNs.</description>
