    <title>"A Compact LISP Encapsulation Scheme to Transport IPv4 Packets over an IPv6 Network", Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-lisp-v6-compact-header-05.txt</link>
    <description>The encapsulation scheme used by the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) may sometimes raise MTU issues at the cost of possibly degrading the overall performance of the LISP network, especially in IPv6 migration contexts.  This document proposes a new, more compact, encapsulation scheme that aims to accommodate such issues and facilitate LISP deployment for IPv6 migration purposes, in particular.  This compact header may be considered to provide IPv4 over IPv6 connectivity for mobile LISP-capable devices.</description>
