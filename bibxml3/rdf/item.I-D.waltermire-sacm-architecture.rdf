    <title>"Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Architecture", David Waltermire</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-waltermire-sacm-architecture-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document identifies the architectural components, data flows, and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable automation infrastructure required to support timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT systems. This architecture is based on previous use case and requirements analysis.  Automation tools implementing the continuous monitoring approach described in this document will utilize this infrastructure together with existing and emerging event, incident and network management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical information. Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</description>
