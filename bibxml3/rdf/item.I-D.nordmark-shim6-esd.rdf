    <title>"Extended Shim6 Design for ID/loc split and Traffic Engineering", Erik  Nordmark</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nordmark-shim6-esd-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying the 'first, do no harm' security requirements.  This document outlines three rather orthogonal sets of extensions to Shim6.  The first one is how to procide complete separation between identifiers and locators.  The second one is how to allow routers to rewrite the locators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide traffic engineering information to the hosts.  The third one is the outline of a simple extension to allow shim6, with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate using IPv4 addresses as locators.  The purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.</description>
