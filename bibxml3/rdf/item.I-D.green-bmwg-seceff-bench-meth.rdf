    <title>"Benchmarking Methodology for Evaluating the Security Effectiveness of Content Aware Devices", Kenneth Green, Tom Alexander</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-green-bmwg-seceff-bench-meth-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a methodology for evaluating the ability of content-aware network devices to correctly detect and block malicious or administratively disallowed traffic flows. This benchmark addresses the issue of classification accuracy under well defined conditions. It is not concerned with measuring forwarding performance which is covered by other BMWG documents.</description>
