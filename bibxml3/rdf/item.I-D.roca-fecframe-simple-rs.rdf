    <description>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for Reed- Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 16, that can be used to protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.  Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal protection against packet erasures.  They are also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols. The price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for instance.</description>
