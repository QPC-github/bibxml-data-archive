    <title>"Using DHCP to Manage Node and Ring SID Assignment", Kireeti Kompella, Ron Bonica</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kompella-spring-dhcp-00.txt</link>
    <description>Node and ring segment identifiers (SIDs) assignements in a particular domain (such as an IGP area) must follow certain rules: they must be allocated from a configured set of SID blocks; they must be unique; and the values should be sticky, i.e., the same value(s) should be assigned to a node should its assignment expire (as might happen if the node resets).  This memo suggests the use of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol to handle such assignments.</description>
