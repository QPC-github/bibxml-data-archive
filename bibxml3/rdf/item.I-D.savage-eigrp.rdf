    <description>This document describes the protocol design and architecture for Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). EIGRP is a routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology. The specific algorithm used is called DUAL, a Diffusing Update Algorithm as reference in "Loop-Free Routing using Diffusing Computations". The algorithm and procedures were researched, developed, and simulated by SRI International.</description>
