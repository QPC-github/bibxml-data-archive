    <description>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This document has three goals.  First, increase the security of Kerberos pre-authentication exchanges by making offline brute-force attacks infeasible.  Second, enable the use of secure second factor authentication without relying on FAST.  This is achived using the existing trust relationship established by the shared first factor. Third, make Kerberos pre-authentication more resilient against time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp from the client.</description>
