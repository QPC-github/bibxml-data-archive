    <title>"Verifying Correctness of Alternate Care-of Address Option", Jari Arkko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-arkko-mext-rfc3775-altcoa-check-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document revises the RFC 3775 rules on how Alternate Care-of Address option is processed.  Alternate Care-of Address option is used to carry the current care-of address inside a Mobility Header message.  This is used in addition to the source address in the packet in order to ensure that the care-of address is protected by IPsec ESP, the security mechanism that protects Mobility Header messages.  Unfortunately, RFC 3775 did not require verification that the source address and care-of address are the same.  This document adds that requirement.</description>
