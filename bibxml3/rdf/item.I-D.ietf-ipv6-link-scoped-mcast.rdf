    <title>"A Method for Generating Link Scoped IPv6 Multicast Addresses", Jung-Soo  Park</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipv6-link-scoped-mcast-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for the use of Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses. When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely determined. After that, each node can generate their unique multicast addresses automatically without conflicts. Basically, this document proposes an alternative method for creating link-local multicast addresses over a known method like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses. It is preferred to use this method for link-local scope rather than unicast- prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses. This memo update RFC3306.</description>
