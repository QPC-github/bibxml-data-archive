    <title>"mLDP Extensions for Multi-Topology Routing", IJsbrand Wijnands, Kamran Raza</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iwijnand-mpls-mldp-multi-topology-04.txt</link>
    <description>The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation through class-based forwarding.  IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) and LDP have already been extended to setup MTR.  In order to deploy mLDP in an MTR network, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware. This document specifies extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology Routing.</description>
