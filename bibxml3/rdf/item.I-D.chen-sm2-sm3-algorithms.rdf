        <description>The Handle System is a global name service that allows secured handle resolution and administration over the public Internet according to [1][5][3]. Handle System protocol [3] is designed to be transmitted as a byte stream via a TCP connection. In this document, SM2 and SM3 algorithms [4][5]are introduced into the handle system to enhance the security and compactivity. Trusted resolution and message credential are extended to support SM2 and SM3 algorithms.</description>
