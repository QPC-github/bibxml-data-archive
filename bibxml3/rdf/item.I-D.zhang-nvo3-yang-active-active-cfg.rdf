    <description>When a Tenant System is not collocated with Network Virtualization Edges (NVEs), it's possible for this Tenant System to connect to a group of NVEs or a single NVE with multiple underlay IP addresses to use the active-active multihoming L2/L3 service provided by these NVEs.  This document defines the YANG data model that can be used to configure NVEs of a NVO3 network to achieve active-active multi- homing.</description>
