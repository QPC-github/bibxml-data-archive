    <description>In VXLAN overlay networks, Operation and Management(OAM)functions are important for fault management and performance monitoring.  Path Detection(PD) is one critical OAM function which is applied to monitor and/or diagnose the potential paths between two VTEPs or between two Tenant System.  In addition, it can assist to identify the locations of failures on data transmission paths.  This document specifies a method of PD method for VXLAN Overlay Networks by using a centralized controller.  However,the method can be easily extended to support the overlay networks without a centrilized controller.  It can also be generalized to other overlay technique such as NVGRE.</description>
