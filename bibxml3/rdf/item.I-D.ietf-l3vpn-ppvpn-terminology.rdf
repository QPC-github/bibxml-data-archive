    <description>The wide spread interest in provider-provisioned VPN solutions lead to memos proposing different and overlapping solutions. The IETF working groups, first Provider Provisioned VPNs and later Layer 2 VPNs and Layer 3 VPNs, have been discussed these proposals and documented specifications. This has lead to the development of a partly new set of concepts used to describe the set of VPN services. To a certain extent there is more than one term covering the same concept and sometimes the same term covers more than one concept. This document seeks to fill the need to make the terminology in the area clearer and more intuitive.</description>
