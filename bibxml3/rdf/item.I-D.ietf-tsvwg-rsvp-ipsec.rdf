    <title>"Generic Aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) Reservations", Francois Le Faucheur</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-ipsec-05.txt</link>
    <description>RFC3175 defines aggregate Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) reservations allowing resources to be reserved in a Diffserv network for a given Per Hop Behavior (PHB), or given set of PHBs, from a given source to a given destination. RFC3175 also defines how end-to- end RSVP reservations can be aggregated onto such aggregate reservations when transiting through a Diffserv cloud. There are situations where multiple such aggregate reservations are needed for the same source IP address, destination IP address and PHB (or set of PHBs). However, this is not supported by the aggregate reservations defined in RFC3175. In order to support this, the present document defines a more flexible type of aggregate RSVP reservations, referred to as generic aggregate reservation. Multiple such generic aggregate reservations can be established for a given PHB (or set of PHBs) from a given source IP address to a given destination IP address. The generic aggregate reservations may be used to aggregate end-to-end RSVP reservations. This document also defines the procedures for such aggregation. The generic aggregate reservations may also be used end- to-end directly by end-systems attached to a Diffserv network.</description>
