    <description>This document extends Node and Link Attribute TLVs to Border Gateway Protocol-Link State (BGP-LS) to advertise supported In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) capabilities at node and/or link granularity.  An ingress router cannot insert IFIT-Data-Fields for packets going into a path unless an egress router has indicated via signaling that it has the capability to process IFIT-Data-Fields.  In addition, such advertisements would be useful for entities (e.g. Path Computation Element (PCE)) to gather each router's IFIT capability for achieving the computation of end-to-end Traffic Engineering (TE) paths that be able to fulfill the visibility of on- path OAM data.</description>
