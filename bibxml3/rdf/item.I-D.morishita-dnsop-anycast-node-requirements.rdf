    <title>"BGP Anycast Node Requirements for Authoritative Name Servers", Yasuhiro  Morishita</title>

    <description>IP anycast [1] is a technology to share one IP address for Internet services with multiple server nodes. It is now being deployed for improving service reliability, scalability, and stability. Especially, "Global-Scope" IP anycast is now being deployed for authoritative name servers, typically for root servers. RFC 3258 [2] describes a set of practices to apply IP anycast technology for authoritative name servers. And "Operation of Anycast Services" Internet-Draft [3] (hereafter, called "Anycast BCP") describes a series of recommendations and considerations for distribution of services using IP anycast. On the other hand, operators of authoritative name servers can also refer to RFC 2182 [4] and 2870 [5] for general guidances on appropriate practices for authoritative name servers. This memo describes the details of requirements and preconditions for making "Global-Scope" IP anycast nodes for authoritative name servers, with the conformance of the practices in RFC 2182, 2870, 3258 and Anycast BCP. And this memo also describes our findings and experiences for making IP anycast nodes for us. Authors hope that it is useful for DNS operators that they will walk on the same way in the future, especially for TLD operators.</description>
