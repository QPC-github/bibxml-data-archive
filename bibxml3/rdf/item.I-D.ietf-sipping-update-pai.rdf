    <title>"Updates to Asserted Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", John Elwell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-update-pai-09.txt</link>
    <description>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of the originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity header field.  This header field is specified for use in requests using a number of SIP methods, in particular the INVITE method.  However, RFC 3325 does not specify the insertion of this header field by a trusted UAC, does not specify the use of P-Asserted-Identity and P-Preferred- Identity header fields with certain SIP methods such as UPDATE, REGISTER, MESSAGE and PUBLISH, and does not specify how to handle an unexpected number of URIs or unexpected URI schemes in these header fields.  This document extends RFC 3325 to cover these situations.  This work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
