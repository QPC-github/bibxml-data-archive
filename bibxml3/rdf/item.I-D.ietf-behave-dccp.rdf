    <title>"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for the Datagram  Congestion Control Protocol", Remi Denis-Courmont</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-behave-dccp-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  Those allow DCCP applications, such as streaming applications to operate consistently. These requirements are very similar to the TCP requirements for NATs already published by the IETF.  Ensuring that NATs meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications using DCCP will function properly.</description>
