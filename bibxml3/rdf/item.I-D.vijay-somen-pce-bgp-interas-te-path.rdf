    <description>The ability to compute an optimal path for setting up Traffic engineering Label Switched Paths spanning multiple autonomous systems managed by different operators has been a key requirement in MPLS and GMPLS networks. This document specifies a method of computing inter-AS paths consisting of a list of ASes to be traversed and a list of TE-Tunnels to be traversed in each AS. The method described here uses BGP speakers in the PCEs of each AS to distribute the inter-AS connectivity information and the TE-Tunnels in each AS to its neighbors to facilitate the construction of an inter-AS topology graph which can be used for computing inter-AS paths.</description>
