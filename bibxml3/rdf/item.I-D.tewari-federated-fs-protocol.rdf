    <description>This document describes a file system federation protocol that enables file access and namespace traversal across collections of independently administered fileservers. The protocol specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers and collections of fileservers with different administrators can form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of the filesystems physically hosted on and exported by the constituent fileservers.</description>
