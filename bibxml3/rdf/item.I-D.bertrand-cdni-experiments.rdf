    <description>This document reports studies and related experiments on CDN interconnection performed by France Telecom-Orange Labs.  The document summarizes implications of CDN interconnection to CDN service providers and lessons learned through CDNI experiments.  The main purpose of the experiments was to test the interconnection of CDN solutions from two vendors (namely, Cisco and Verivue) and to identify the gaps and needs for standardization work for CDN interconnection.</description>
