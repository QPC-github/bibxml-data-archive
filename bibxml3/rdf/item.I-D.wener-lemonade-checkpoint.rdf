    <title>"IMAP Extension for CHECKPOINT Synchronization", Michael Wener</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wener-lemonade-checkpoint-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an IMAP extension that aids in allowing a client to maintain mailbox synchronization without performing a deep sync after each connection. The goal is to minimize, but not eliminate, the need for deep synchronizations. The extension defines a way for a client to receive and acknowledge state change responses from the server.</description>
