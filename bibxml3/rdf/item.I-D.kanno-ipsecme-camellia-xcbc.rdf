    <description>This memo specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of XCBC mode with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header protocols.  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-96.  Latter is pseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia block cipher for Internet Key Exchange.  This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF- 128.</description>
