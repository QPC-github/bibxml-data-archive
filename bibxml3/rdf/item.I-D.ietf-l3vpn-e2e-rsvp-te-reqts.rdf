    <description>Today, customers expect to run triple play services through BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. Some Service Providers will deploy services that request QoS guarantees from a local CE to a remote CE across the network. As a result, the application (e.g., voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe, etc.) requirements for an end-to- end QOS and reserving an adequate bandwidth continue to increase.  Service Providers can use both an MPLS and an MPLS-TE LSP to meet the service objectives. This document describes service provider requirements for supporting a customer RSVP and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN.</description>
