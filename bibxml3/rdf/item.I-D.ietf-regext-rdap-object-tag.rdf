    <title>"Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Object Tagging", Scott Hollenbeck, Andrew Newton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-regext-rdap-object-tag-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) includes a method that can be used to identify the authoritative server for processing domain name, IP address, and autonomous system number queries.  The method does not describe how to identify the authoritative server for processing other RDAP query types, such as entity queries.  This limitation exists because the identifiers associated with these query types are typically unstructured.  This document updates RFC 7484 by describing an operational practice that can be used to add structure to RDAP identifiers that makes it possible to identify the authoritative server for additional RDAP queries.</description>
