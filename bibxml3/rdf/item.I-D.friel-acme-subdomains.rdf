        <description>This document outlines how ACME can be used by a client to obtain a certificate for a subdomain identifier from a certification authority.  The client has fulfilled a challenge against a parent domain but does not need to fulfill a challenge against the explicit subdomain as certificate policy allows issuance of the subdomain certificate without explicit subdomain ownership proof.</description>
