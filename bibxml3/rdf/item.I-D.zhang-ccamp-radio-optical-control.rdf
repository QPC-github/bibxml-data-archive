    <description>This memo specifies an unified radio and optical control architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN).  The architecture is designed for the purposes of end-to-end 5G Radio Access Networks (RAN) service, which enables joint radio and optical network resoures orchestration.  Based on this architecture, some new applications could be achieved, such as enhanced Coordinated MultiPoint (eCoMP) service, Baseband Unit (BBU) aggregation, fronthaul traffic prediction and so on.</description>
