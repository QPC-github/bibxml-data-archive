    <title>"Update to the IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures for the Replacement of the IAOC with the IETF Administration LLC", Pete Resnick, Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7776bis-03.txt</link>
    <description>The IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures are described in RFC 7776.  The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has been replaced by the IETF Administration LLC, and the IETF Administrative Director has been replaced by the IETF LLC Executive Director.  This document updates RFC 7776 to amend these terms.  RFC 7776 contained updates to RFC 7437.  draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis has incorporated those updates, so this document also updates RFC 7776 to remove those updates.  NOTE for RFC Editor and Readers of this Document  When published as an RFC  o  All references to and mentions of draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis in this document should be replaced by the RFC that results from draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis.  o  The string "XXXX" should be replaced with the RFC number assigned to the RFC that results from draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis.  o  This note should be removed.  *** END OF NOTE ***</description>
