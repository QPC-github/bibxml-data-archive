    <title>"Ogg Encapsulation for the Opus Audio Codec", Timothy Terriberry, Ron Lee, Ralph Giles</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-terriberry-oggopus-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the Ogg encapsulation for the Opus interactive speech and audio codec.  This allows data encoded in the Opus format to be stored in an Ogg logical bitstream.  Ogg encapsulation provides Opus with a long-term storage format supporting all of the essential features, including metadata, fast and accurate seeking, corruption detection, recapture after errors, low overhead, and the ability to multiplex Opus with other codecs (including video) with minimal buffering.  It also provides a live streamable format, capable of delivery over a reliable stream-oriented transport, without requiring all the data, or even the total length of the data, up-front, in a form that is identical to the on-disk storage format.</description>
