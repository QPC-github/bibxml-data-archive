    <description>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths between end- systems.  These are typically provided by using different IP addresses obtained by different ISPs at the end-systems.  While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end-systems are single-homed (e.g. desktop PCs in an enterprise).  It seems also likely that a lot of network sites will insist on having all traffic pass a single network element (e.g. for security reasons) before traffic is split across multiple paths.  This memo therefore describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at the end-systems but somewhere within the network.</description>
