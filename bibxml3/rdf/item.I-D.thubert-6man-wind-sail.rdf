    <title>"Wireless Neighbor Discovery Stateful Address Identification and Location exchange", Pascal Thubert, Eric Levy-Abegnoli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thubert-6man-wind-sail-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to exchange Stateful Address Identification and Location between State Maintaining Entities located over a backbone link about attached nodes that are attached to the backbone via a Wireless Link, in order to maintain all the entities up-to-date and maintain reachability as the attached nodes move.</description>
