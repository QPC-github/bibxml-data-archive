    <title>"P-Charge-Info - A Private Header (P-Header) Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Dan York, Tolga Asveren</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info-05.txt</link>
    <description>This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing information about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is currently in production usage by a number of equipment vendors and carriers and this document is submitted to request the registration of this header with IANA.  This P-Header may also be used in some situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN interconnection.  NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008 under the name draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.  This -05 document is identical to draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for edits to the text to indicate this is now for the DISPATCH working group as the SIPPING working group no longer exists.</description>
