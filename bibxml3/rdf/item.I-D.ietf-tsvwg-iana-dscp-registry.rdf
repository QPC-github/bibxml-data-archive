    <title>"IANA Assignment of DSCP Pool 3 (xxxx01) Values to require Publication of a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC", Gorry Fairhurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-iana-dscp-registry-08.txt</link>
    <description>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of a field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP) values.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values.  This update to RFC2474 changes the IANA assignment policy for Pool 3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for experimental and Local Use of the Codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.</description>
