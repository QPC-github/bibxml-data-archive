    <description>Wireless, low power field devices enable industrial users to significantly increase the amount of information collected and the number of control points that can be remotely managed.  The deployment of these wireless devices will significantly improve the productivity and safety of the plants while increasing the efficiency of the plant workers.  For wireless devices to have a significant advantage over wired devices in an industrial environment the wireless network needs to have three qualities: low power, high reliability, and easy installation and maintenance.  The aim of this document is to analyze the requirements for the routing protocol used for low power and lossy networks (L2N) in industrial environments.</description>
