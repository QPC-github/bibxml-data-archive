    <title>"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication Diversion Information in support of the Communication Diversion (CDIV) Notification (CDIVN) CDIV service", John-Luc Bakker, Ranjit Avasarala</title>

    <description>3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) supplementary service.  As part of CDIV, a SIP based event package is used for notifying users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of requests for communication sessions targetting the user.  This document defines the SIP event package to support subscription and notification of diversions.  The proposed event package is applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general internet.</description>
