    <title>"Extension to BGP-VPLS for E-Tree", Yuqun Cao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-l2vpn-bgp-vpls-etree-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service using BGP for auto-discovery and signaling [RFC4761]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking pseudowire between Leafs to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered.</description>
