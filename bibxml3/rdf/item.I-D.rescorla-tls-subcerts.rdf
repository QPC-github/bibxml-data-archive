    <title>"Delegated Credentials for TLS", Richard Barnes, Subodh Iyengar, Nick Sullivan, Eric Rescorla</title>

    <description>The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS server and the certificate authority that provides it credentials can cause problems, for example when it comes to reducing the lifetime of certificates or supporting new cryptographic algorithms.  This document describes a mechanism to allow TLS server operators to create their own credential delegations without breaking compatibility with clients that do not support this specification.</description>
