    <title>"Delegated CoAP Authentication and Authorization Framework (DCAF)", Stefanie Gerdes, Olaf Bergmann, Carsten Bormann</title>

    <description>This specification defines a protocol for delegating client authentication and authorization in a constrained environment for establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel between resource-constrained nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS to transfer authorization information and shared secrets for symmetric cryptography between entities in a constrained network.  A resource- constrained node can use this protocol to delegate authentication of communication peers and management of authorization information to a trusted host with less severe limitations regarding processing power and memory.</description>
