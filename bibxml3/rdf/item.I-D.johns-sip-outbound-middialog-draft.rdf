    <description>This document describes a solution for routing of mid-dialog requests in the presence of NATs. The solution leverages and extends the concepts described in the Internet Draft titled Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol. This solution is necessary to support routing of mid-dialog requests while preserving Edge Proxy failover within an outbound-proxy-set.</description>
