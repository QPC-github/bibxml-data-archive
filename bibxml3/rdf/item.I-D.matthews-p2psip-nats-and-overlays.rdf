    <title>"The Effect of NATs on P2PSIP Overlay Architecture", Eric Cooper, Philip  Matthews</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-matthews-p2psip-nats-and-overlays-01.txt</link>
    <description>This paper explains the problems created by Network Address Translators (NATs) in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays and recommends some NAT traversal techniques appropriate for P2PSIP networks. Two P2PSIP overlay architectures that accommodate the presence of NATs are described and analyzed. The first is the super-peer scheme used in a number of p2p file-sharing systems today. The second is a scheme where all peers play an equal role in the overlay.</description>
