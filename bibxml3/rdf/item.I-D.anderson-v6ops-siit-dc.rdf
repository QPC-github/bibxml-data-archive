    <description>This document describes SIIT-DC, an extension to Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) [RFC6145] that makes it ideally suited for use in IPv6 data centre environments.  SIIT-DC simultaneously facilitates IPv6 deployment and IPv4 address conservation.  The overall SIIT-DC architecture is described, as well as guidelines for operators. Finally, the normative implementation requirements are described, as a list of additions and changes to SIIT [RFC6145].</description>
