    <description>Today, networked applications typically make use of name-oriented network abstractions.  There is a myriad of application development frameworks who provide abstracted APIs allowing applications to refer to their peers by name.  These abstractions normally only provide application-layer protocol functionality.  They are normally uni- lateral solutions, the support for the protocol used is implied by the service accessed on the remote peer(s).  We suggest a unified API for networked applications.  Isomorphic to the existing name-based solutions, but with added network-related functionality.  Providing an existing application-layer protocols with network features such as mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6 interoperability, NAT-traversal and so on...</description>
