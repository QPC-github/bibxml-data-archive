    <title>"Extended DTLS Session Resumption for Constrained Network Environments", Rene Hummen, Johannes Gilger, Hossein Shafagh</title>

    <description>This draft defines two extensions for the existing session resumption mechanisms of TLS that specifically apply to Datagram TLS (DTLS) in constrained network environments.  Session resumption type negotiation enables the client and the server to explicitly agree on the session resumption mechanism for subsequent handshakes, thus avoiding unnecessary overheads occurring with the existing specifications.  Session resumption without client-side state additionally enables a constrained DTLS client to resume a session without the need to maintain state while the session is inactive. The extensions defined in this draft update [RFC5077] and [RFC5246].</description>
