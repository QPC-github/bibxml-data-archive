    <description>This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for Reverse DNS Management in a tightly controlled Representational State Transfer (REST) environment.  This document describes a schema that has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" based system since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA through an X.509 certificate mediated HTTPS transaction.</description>
