        <description>This document specifies the operations performed by a proxy, when using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group communication scenarios.  Such a proxy processes a single request sent by a client over unicast, and distributes the request over IP multicast to a group of servers.  Then, the proxy collects the individual responses from those servers and relays those responses back to the client, in a way that allows the client to distinguish the responses and their origin servers through embedded addressing information.  This document updates RFC7252 with respect to caching of response messages at proxies.</description>
