    <description>This document describes experiences and lessons learnt organizing remote sessions for working group meetings in Latin America. The main objective is to engage people in the IETF through small and informal meetings with people that share common interests.  At the same time, remote participation for those already active in the IETF is more attractive and they help with IETF outreach sharing their experiences with newcomers.  The local meetings are called remote IETF Working Group Hubs.</description>
