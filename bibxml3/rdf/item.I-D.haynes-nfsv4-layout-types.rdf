    <title>"Considerations for a New pNFS Layout Type", Tom Haynes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-haynes-nfsv4-layout-types-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides help in distinguishing between the requirements for Network File System (NFS) version 4.1's Parallel NFS (pNFS) and those those specifically directed to the pNFS File Layout. The lack of a clear separation between the two set of requirements may be troublesome for those trying to specify new Layout Types.</description>
