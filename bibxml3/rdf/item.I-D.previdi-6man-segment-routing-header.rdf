    <description>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending a SR header to the packet.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a flow through any path (topological, or application/service based) while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR domain.  Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header.  This draft describes the Segment Routing Extension Header Type and how it is used by SR capable nodes.</description>
