    <title>"IPv6 Host to Router Load Sharing", Robert Hinden, Dave Thaler</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipv6-host-load-sharing-04.txt</link>
    <description>The original IPv6 conceptual sending algorithm does not do load- sharing among equivalent IPv6 routers, and suggests schemes which can be problematic in practice. This document updates the conceptual sending algorithm in RFC 2461 so that traffic to different destinations can be distributed among routers in an efficient fashion.</description>
