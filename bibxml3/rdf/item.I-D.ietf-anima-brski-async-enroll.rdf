        <description>This document enhances Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995]) to allow employing alternative enrollment protocols, such as CMP.  Using self-contained signed objects, the origin of enrollment requests and responses can be authenticated independently of message transfer.  This supports end-to-end security and asynchronous operation of certificate enrollment and provides flexibility where to authenticate and authorize certification requests.</description>
