    <description>This document defines three new RADIUS attributes.  For device that implementing IP port ranges, these attributes are used to communicate with a RADIUS server in order to configure and report TCP/UDP ports and ICMP identifiers, as well as mapping behavior for specific hosts. This mechanism can be used in various deployment scenarios such as CGN, NAT64, Provider WiFi Gateway, etc.  This document does not make any assumption about the deployment context.</description>
