    <description>The Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is being specified jointly by IETF and ITU-T.  This document addresses the functionality described in the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document [SurvivFwk] and defines a protocol that may be used to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination for linear protection, as described in that document.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
