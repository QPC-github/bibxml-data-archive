        <description>Motivated by the need to support multiple in-network services and functions in an MPLS network, this document describes a generic and extensible method to encapsulate extension headers into MPLS packets. The encapsulation method allows stacking multiple extension headers and quickly accessing any of them as well as the original upper layer protocol header and payload.  We show how the extension header can be used to support several new network applications and optimize some existing network services.</description>
