    <title>"Extensions to IS-IS for Layer-2 Systems", Ayan Banerjee, David Ward</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-isis-layer2-11.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) extensions necessary to support link state routing for any protocols running directly over Layer-2.  While supporting this concept involves several pieces, this document only describes extensions to IS-IS.  Furthermore, the Type, Length, Value pairs (TLVs) described in this document are generic Layer-2 additions and specific ones as needed are defined in the IS-IS technology specific extensions.  We leave it to the systems using these IS-IS extensions to explain how the information carried in IS-IS is used.</description>
