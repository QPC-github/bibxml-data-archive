    <title>"TLS Downgrade protection extension for TLS DNSSEC Authentication Chain Extension", Paul Wouters, Viktor Dukhovni</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-asmithee-tls-dnssec-downprot-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft specifies a TLS extension that adds downgrade protection for another TLS extension, [dnssec-chain-extension].  Without the downgrade protection specified in this TLS extension, the only effect of deploying [dnssec-chain-extension] is to reduce TLS security from the standard "WebPKI security" to "WebPKI or DANE, whichever is weaker".  This draft dictates that [dnssec-chain-extension] MUST only be used in combination with this TLS extension, whose only content is a two octet SupportLifetime value.  A value of 0 prohibits the TLS client from unilaterally requiring ongoing use of both TLS extensions based on prior observation of their use (pinning).  A non-zero value is the value in hours for which this TLS extension as well as [dnssec-chain-extension] MUST appear in subsequent TLS handshakes to the same TLS hostname and port.  If this TLS extention or [dnssec-chain-extension] is missing from the TLS handshake within this observed pinning time, the TLS client MUST assume it is under attack and abort the TLS connection.</description>
