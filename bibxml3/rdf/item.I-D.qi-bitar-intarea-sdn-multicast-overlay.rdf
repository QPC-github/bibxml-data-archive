    <description>This document describes a framework for IP multicast based on the software defined networking paradigm.  The framework enables flexible allocation of multicast responsibilities to designated control and forwarding elements, and provides for multicast path computation and programming of the forwarding plane. The objective of this framework is to enable network operators to support IP multicast in an IP/MPLS core free of Protocol- Independent-Multicast (PIM) and MPLS multicast control. The forwarding paradigm provides for multicast replication over unicast and multicast overlays at designated edges, and for native IP and MPLS multicast replication and forwarding in the core.</description>
