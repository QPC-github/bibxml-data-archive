    <title>"A Simple Approach to CDN Interconnection", Larry Peterson, John Hartman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peterson-cdni-strawman-01.pdf</link>
    <description>This document presents a simple strawman for CDN interconnection, and uses the strawman as a basis for articulating a set of design principles and exploring (parts of) the CDNI design space.  Our intent is to spur discussion about what information needs to be exchanged between CDN peers, which is a prerequisite for crafting interfaces and protocols to communicate that information.</description>
