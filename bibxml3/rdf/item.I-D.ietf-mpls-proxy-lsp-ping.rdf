    <description>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol Label Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths. An MPLS Proxy Ping Request is sent to any Label Switching Router along a Label Switched Path. The primary motivations for this facility are first to limit the number of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf to leaf/root tracing.</description>
