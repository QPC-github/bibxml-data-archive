    <title>"PASSporT Extension for Diverted Calls", Jon Peterson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-stir-passport-divert-09.txt</link>
    <description>PASSporT is specified in RFC 8225 to convey cryptographically-signed information about the people involved in personal communications. This document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its original destination to a new one.  This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios.  Also specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.</description>
