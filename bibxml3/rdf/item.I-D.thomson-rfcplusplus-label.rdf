    <title>"The Label "RFC"", Martin Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-rfcplusplus-label-00.txt</link>
    <description>The perception and reality of the RFC series have long been separate. More than 20 years of attempts to correct perception, starting with RFC 1796, have been unsuccessful.  This document proposes an experiment to see if changing the labels on document will have any effect on fixing that problem.</description>
