    <description>Upon link down event or link up event, each device in network individually schedules route calculation.  Because of different hardware capabilities and internal/external environments, the time to update forwarding entries on these devices are disordered which can cause a transient forwarding loop.  This document introduces a method to prevent forwarding loop by adjusting link metric gradually for several times.</description>
