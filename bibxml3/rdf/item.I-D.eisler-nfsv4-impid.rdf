    <title>"Identifying Implementations in NFSv4", Mike Eisler</title>

    <description>NFSv4.0 has no method for allowing clients and servers to provide to each other their implementation identities. An implementation identity might contain the name of the software that embodies the NFSv4 client or server, and the version number of the software. This proposal describes how a future minor version of NFSv4.0 could allow clients and servers to exchange implementation identities.</description>
