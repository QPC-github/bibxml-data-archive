    <title>"Routing Optimization in the same nested mobile network", Sungmin Baek</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baek-nemo-nested-ro-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a nested NEMO Route Opimization (NNRO) protocol for the communications between any two nodes in the same nested mobile network. A nested NEMO Route Opimization message is used to exchange the routing information between two mobile network nodes in the same nested mobile network. The protocol is designed in a way such that the mobility of the entire nested mobile network is transparent to the nodes therein.</description>
