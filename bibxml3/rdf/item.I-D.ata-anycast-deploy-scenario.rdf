    <description>Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we list possible deployment scenarios in IPv6 anycasting. We consider three conditions based on the region of anycasting, and list possible scenarios. For each scenario we also clarify example applications as well as technical issues to be resolved.</description>
