    <description>This memo updates the ODETTE File Transfer Protocol, an established file transfer protocol facilitating electronic data interchange of business data between trading partners, to version 2.0. The protocol now supports secure and authenticated communication over the Internet using Transport Layer Security, provides file encryption, signing and compression using Cryptographic Message Syntax and provides signed receipts for the acknowledgement of received files. The protocol supports both direct peer to peer communication and indirect communication via a Value Added Network and may be used with TCP/IP, X.25 and ISDN based networks.</description>
