    <title>"PDAD-OLSR: Passive Duplicate Address Detection for OLSR", Kenichi Mase, Kilian Weniger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-weniger-autoconf-pdad-olsr-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes PDAD-OLSR, a solution for configured address uniqueness maintenance in MANETs running the OLSR protocol. It utilizes the Passive Duplicate Address Detection (PDAD) concept, which enables nodes to passively detect duplicate addresses in the network (e.g., occurring after network merging) by analyzing received routing protocol messages. Due to its passive nature, PDAD-OLSR is very efficient in terms of bandwidth consumption. Moreover, it can prevent the contamination of routing tables with wrong routing information resulting from address conflicts.</description>
