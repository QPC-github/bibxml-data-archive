    <description>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new routing and addressing architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface model.  The IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) allows a Virtual Private Network (VPN) client to keep a connection to a VPN gateway active across multiple network points of attachment or while moving from one network point of attachment to another.  This document examines the similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and observes that they are addressing the same fundamental networking objectives.  It further proposes ways in which the basic MOBIKE model could be extended through adoption of IRON architectural constructs.</description>
