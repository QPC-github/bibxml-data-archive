    <description>IN Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), a multi-homed MN can connect to the PMIPv6 domain by using only one interface even though it has multiple interfaces. It would be efficient when such a multi-homed MN connect to the PMIPv6 domain by using all of its interfaces. If such a multi-homed MN utilizes all of its interfaces, flow mobility can be provided that the MN handovers one or more flows from one interface to another without re-establishing sessions. This document specifies the layer-3 based flow mobility mechanism by considering the intention of the MN. Here, a MN chooses the interface for sending the service traffic and transmits the traffic by using the chosen interface. The PMIPv6 domain can know the intention of the MN when a MAG receives a service flow via a specific network.</description>
