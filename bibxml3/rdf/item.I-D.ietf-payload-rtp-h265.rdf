    <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single as well as multiple RTP streams. When multiple RTP streams are used, a single or multiple transports may be utilized.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.</description>
