    <description>Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we explain a new network architecture for global anycasting to solve (1) in practical use and able to realize with existing technology easily, (2) about support for stateful communications keeping a session information at the end nodes such as TCP. The architecture is based on MIPv6 because there are many similarities between MIPv6 and global anycast.</description>
