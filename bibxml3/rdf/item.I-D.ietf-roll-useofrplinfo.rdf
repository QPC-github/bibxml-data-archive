    <title>"Using RPI Option Type, Routing Header for Source Routes and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation in the RPL Data Plane", Ines Robles, Michael Richardson, Pascal Thubert</title>

    <description>This document looks at different data flows through LLN (Low-Power and Lossy Networks) where RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is used to establish routing.  The document enumerates the cases where RFC6553 (RPI Option Type), RFC6554 (Routing Header for Source Routes) and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required in data plane.  This analysis provides the basis on which to design efficient compression of these headers.  This document updates RFC6553 adding a change to the RPI Option Type.  Additionally, this document updates RFC6550 defining a flag in the DIO Configuration option to indicate about this change and updates RFC8138 as well to consider the new Option Type when the RPL Option is decompressed.</description>
