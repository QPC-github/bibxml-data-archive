    <title>"Storage File Format for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) Audio  Codec", Sassan Ahmadi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-avt-vmr-wb-file-format-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a file format for the storage of variable-rate multimode wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. A MIME type registration is included for VMR-WB files. VMR-WB is a variable-rate multimode wideband speech codec that has a number of operating modes, one of which is interoperable with AMR-WB (i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates. Therefore, provisions have been made in this draft to facilitate retrieval of VMR-WB stored data (generated in the interoperable mode) by AMR-WB decoder.</description>
