    <description>There is no standard terminology as how to talk about use of DNS in various application contexts, this document goal is to facilitate creation of such a vocabulary/taxonomy.  This document started out as proposal for specific word usage for specifications of adding DANE like technology by different protocols/ services.  DANE is a method for specifying in DNS records acceptable keys/certificates for application servers.  The terms defined in this document should be applicable to all uses of service specification that uses DNS records.</description>
