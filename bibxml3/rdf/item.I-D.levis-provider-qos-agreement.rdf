    <title>"Considerations of provider-to-provider agreements for Internet-scale QoS", Pierre Levis, Mohammed Boucadair</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levis-provider-qos-agreement-04.txt</link>
    <description>This memo analyzes provider-to-provider QoS agreements suitable for a global QoS-enabled Internet.  It defines terminology relevant to inter-domain QoS models.  It proposes a new concept denoted by Meta- QoS-Class (MQC).  This concept could potentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain relationships are built between providers. It opens up new perspectives for a QoS-enabled Internet that retains, as much as possible, the openness of the existing best-effort Internet.</description>
