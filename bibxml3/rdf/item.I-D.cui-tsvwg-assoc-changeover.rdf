    <description>Sigtran specifies association-level reliable transport for signaling using SCTP, but in some scenarios a single association failure's reliability mechanism is not sufficient to achieve telco reliability. This document specifies procedures for an SCTP association changeover solution which will enable applications to meet a higher degree of availability. Two generic changeover solutions are presented in this document. One is implemented inside the SCTP protocol stack and the other requires SCTP and ULP to work in collaboration.</description>
