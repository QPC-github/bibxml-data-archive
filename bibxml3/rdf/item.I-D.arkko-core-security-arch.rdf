    <description>Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight protocol designed to be used in machine-to-machine applications.  This memo describes challenges associated with securing CoAP and proposes a new security model that the authors believe is suitable for these environments.  The model requires minimal amount of configuration, but still provides strong security and is a natural fit with the typical communication practices smart object networking environments. This memo also proposes JSON payload format extensions to support the architecture.</description>
