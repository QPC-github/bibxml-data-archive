    <description>This document considers the applicability of the IETF Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to Packet Optical Integration (POI), and IP and Optical DWDM domain internetworking.  In this document, we highlight the IETF protocols and YANG data models that may be used for the ACTN and control of POI networks, with particular focus on the interfaces between the MDSC (Multi- Domain Service Coordinator) and the underlying Packet and Optical Domain Controllers (P-PNC and O-PNC) to support POI use cases.</description>
