        <description>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than 10 cm apart.  NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LoWPAN techniques.</description>
