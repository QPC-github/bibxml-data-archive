    <description>There are challenges to request quality of service for an application or network flow that is not part of a mobile network's Evolved Packet Core (EPC).  This document addresses this issue by defining a mechanism to signal the desired characteristics of a flow to the Mobile Network from a User Equipment (UE) using Port Control Protocol (PCP).  The signaled characteristics allow the Mobile Network to enforce appropriate policies such as prioritize that flow accordingly and trigger dedicated bearer activation or bearer modification procedure.</description>
