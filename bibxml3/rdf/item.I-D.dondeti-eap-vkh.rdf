    <title>"EAP Keying and Re-authentication in Visited Domains", Lakshminath Dondeti, Vidya Narayanan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dondeti-eap-vkh-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a visited domain key hierarchy derived from the extended master session key (EMSK) from EAP to facilitate visited domain key management for various purposes including fast handovers and visited domain services. The visited domain key hierarchy avoids the latency associated with communicating with the home domain as in case of a full EAP method run or even in a single round trip as with the EAP efficient reauthentication scheme, and that is especially desirable when the protocol is in the critical path of a handover.</description>
