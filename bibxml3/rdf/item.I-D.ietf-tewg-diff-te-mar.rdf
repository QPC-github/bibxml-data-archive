    <title>"Max Allocation with Reservation Bandwidth Constraint Model for MPLS/DiffServ  TE &amp; Performance Comparisons", Jerry Ash</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tewg-diff-te-mar-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document complements the DiffServ-aware MPLS TE (DS-TE) requirements document by giving a functional specification for the Maximum Allocation with Reservation (MAR) Bandwidth Constraints Model. Assumptions, applicability, and examples of the operation of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model are presented. MAR performance is analyzed relative to the criteria for selecting a Bandwidth Constraints Model, in order to provide guidance to user implementation of the model in their networks.</description>
