    <title>"A NULL MX Resource Record for Domains that Accept No Mail", John Levine, Mark Delany</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-delany-nullmx-02.txt</link>
    <description>When the 5321.MailFrom domain in an e-mail message has a DNS MX Resource Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is willing to accept email.  However, when the domain has just a DNS A or AAAA RR, there mail clients cannot easily tell whether the domain accepts mail, as many hosts on the Internet advertise an A or AAAA RR regardless of whether they want to accept email.  The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts no mail.</description>
