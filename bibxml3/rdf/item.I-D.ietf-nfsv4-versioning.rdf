    <title>"Rules for NFSv4 Extensions and Minor Versions", David Noveck</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-nfsv4-versioning-11.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the rules relating to the extension of the NFSv4 family of protocols.  It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of optional features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features already published as Proposed Standards.  The rules relating to the construction of minor versions and the interaction of minor version implementations that appear in this document supersede the minor versioning rules in RFC5661 and other RFCs defining minor versions.</description>
