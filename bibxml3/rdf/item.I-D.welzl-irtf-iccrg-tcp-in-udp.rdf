    <description>This document specifies a method to encapsulate multiple TCP connections using only one UDP port number pair.  Doing so allows for a relatively easy implementation of coupled congestion control for the TCP connections.  This can have several performance benefits, and it makes it possible to precisely assign a share of the congestion window to the connections based on priorities.  It also enables use of UDP-based NAT traversal techniques, and it can act as a framework for experimentation with novel changes to the TCP standard.</description>
