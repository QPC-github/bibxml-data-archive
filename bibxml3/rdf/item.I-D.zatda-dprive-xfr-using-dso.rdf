    <description>DNS zone transfers are transmitted in clear text, which gives attackers the opportunity to collect the content of a zone by eavesdropping on network connections.  This document specifies use of DNS Stateful Operations to enable a subscribe/publish mechanism for zone transfers reducing the over head introduced by NOTITY/SOA interactions prior to zone transfer request.  This additionally prevents zone contents collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers by restricting XFR using DSO to require TLS.</description>
