    <description>Current mobility solutions generally introduce an anchor point in the network, e.g., HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP.  The anchor point is used to maintain the mapping between the stable IP address (e.g., Home address in MIPv6) and the current routable IP address (e.g., CoA in MIPv6).  However, one of the trend in mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by confining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access routers level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of the mobility events and their support.  This document discusses the deployment of current IP mobility mechanisms in such a flat architecture.</description>
