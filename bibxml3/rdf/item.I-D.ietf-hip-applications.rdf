    <title>"Using the Host Identity Protocol with Legacy Applications", Tom Henderson, Pekka Nikander, Miika Komu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-hip-applications-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document is an informative overview of how legacy applications can be made to work with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  HIP proposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names. From an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address family of host identifiers, but it may be a long time until such HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are upgraded.  This informational document discusses implementation and Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not, and is intended to aid implementors and early adopters in thinking about and locally solving systems issues regarding the incremental deployment of HIP.</description>
