    <title>"The Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Vijay Gurbani, Alan Jeffrey</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gurbani-sip-tls-use-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document explores the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). We do so by outlining the goals and the non-goals for the use of TLS and SIP. In doing so, a number of open questions are encountered regarding the contents of certificates and the behavior of SIP entities using such certificates. We hope to foster discussion in the SIP working group on these issues.</description>
