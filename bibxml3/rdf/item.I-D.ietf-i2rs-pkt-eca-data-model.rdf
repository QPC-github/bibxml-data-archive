    <title>"Filter-Based Packet Forwarding ECA Policy", Susan Hares, Linda Dunbar, Russ White</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-i2rs-pkt-eca-data-model-03.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes the yang data model for packet forwarding policy that filters received packets and forwards (or drops) the packets.  Filters for Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4, and packet-arrival time are linked together to support filtering for the routing layer. Prior to forwarding the packets out other interfaces, some of the fields in the packets may be modified.  (If one considers the packet reception an event, this packet policy is a minimalistic Event-Match Condition-Action policy.)  This policy controls forwarding of packets received by a routing device on one or more interfaces on which this policy is enabled.  This data model may be used in either the configuration datastore, control plane datastores, or the I2RS ephemeral control plane datastore.</description>
