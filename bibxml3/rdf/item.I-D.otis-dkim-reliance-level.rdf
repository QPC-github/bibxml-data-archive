    <description>This document describes a mechanism permitting the DKIM signing domain to indicate different levels of reliance be given to specific messages by the recipient. This reliance indication is a security and safety enhancement when messages are selectively screened or annotated based upon generally trusted DKIM signing domains. Using this reliance mechanism, the signing domain better protects recipients by indicating low reliance levels when messages are from poorly-vetted sources. A low reliance level warns the recipient to increase the scrutiny given to such messages and also to appropriately limit message annotations. Without a means for a DKIM signing domain to partition the handling of their messages, their least vetted source may diminish the trust that might otherwise be established for their signed messages.</description>
