    <description>The Benchmarking Methodologies defined in RFC2544 [1] are IP version independent however, they do not address some of the specificities of IPv6. This document provides additional benchmarking guidelines which in conjunction with RFC2544 will lead to a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance of network elements.</description>
