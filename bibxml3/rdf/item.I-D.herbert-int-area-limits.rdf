    <title>"Guidance to limit size of protocol headers in packets", Tom Herbert</title>

    <description>This specification provides guidance for limiting the size of protocol headers in packets. Intermediate nodes that perform deep packet inspection (DPI), particularly hardware implementations, are often limited as to how many bytes of protocol headers they can process. We recommend that 256 bytes be established as the minimum number of bytes of headers that intermediate nodes are expected to be able to process. This limit is explicitly not intended to be a standard requirement, however it can be used as a guideline in hardware design, protocol design, as well as a useful constraint in implementation or configuration.</description>
