    <title>"Analysis of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-based  Recovery Mechanisms (including Protection and Restoration)", Dimitri Papadimitriou, Eric Mannie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-recovery-analysis-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an analysis grid to evaluate, compare and contrast the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite capabilities with respect to the recovery mechanisms currently proposed at the IETF CCAMP Working Group. A detailed analysis of each of the recovery phases is provided using the terminology defined in a companion document. This document focuses on transport plane survivability and recovery issues and not on control plane resilience and related aspects.</description>
