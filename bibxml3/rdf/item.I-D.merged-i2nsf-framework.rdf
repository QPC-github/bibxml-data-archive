    <description>This document defines the framework for guiding the functionality provided by I2NSF. Network security functions (NSFs) are packet- processing engines that inspect and optionally modify packets traversing networks, either directly or in the context of sessions in which the packet is associated. This document provides an overview of how NSFs are used, and describes how NSF software interfaces are controlled and monitored using rulesets. The design of these software interfaces must prevent the creation of implied constraints on NSF capability and functionality.</description>
