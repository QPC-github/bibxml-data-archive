    <description>PIM Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to forward multicast packets from new sources.  Once last hop routers receive packets from a new source, they may join the Shortest Path Tree for the source for optimal forwarding.  This draft defines a new mechanism that provides a way to support PIM-SM without the need for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees.  Multicast source information is flooded throughout the multicast domain using a new generic PIM flooding mechanism.  This allows last hop routers to learn about new sources without receiving initial data packets.</description>
