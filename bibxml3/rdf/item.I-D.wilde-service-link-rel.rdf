    <description>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.  Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs".  This specification defines link relations for representing relationships from those resources to ones that provide documentation, descriptions, or metadata for these Web services.  Documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers; metadata is supposed to be information about a service's context.  It also defines a link relation to identify status resources that are used to represent operational information about service status.</description>
