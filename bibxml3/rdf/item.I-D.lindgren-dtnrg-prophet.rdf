    <title>"Probabilistic Routing Protocol for Intermittently Connected Networks", Anders Lindgren, Avri Doria</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lindgren-dtnrg-prophet-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a routing protocol for intermittently connected networks, where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts. These networks are examples of networks where the Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[1] is applicable. The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</description>
