    <title>"Probabilistic Loss Ratio Search for Packet Throughput (PLRsearch)", Maciek Konstantynowicz, Vratko Polak</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vpolak-plrsearch-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document addresses challenges while applying methodologies described in [RFC2544] to benchmarking NFV (Network Function Virtualization) over an extended period of time, sometimes referred to as "soak testing".  More specifically to benchmarking software based implementations of NFV data planes.  Packet throughput search approach proposed by this document assumes that system under test is probabilistic in nature, and not deterministic.</description>
