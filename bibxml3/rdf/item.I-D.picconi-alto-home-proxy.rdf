    <description>This documents discusses the use of ALTO proxies running on home devices such as gateways or home NAS servers. An ALTO home proxy caches ALTO information obtained from an origin ALTO server, and uses that information to serve queries originating from the home network. ALTO home proxies reduce ALTO traffic and query latency, improve scalability, and enhance user privacy.</description>
