    <title>"Generic YANG Data Model for Connection Oriented Operations, Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols", Deepak Kumar, Qin Wu, Zitao Wang</title>

    <description>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connection oriented OAM protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for such protocols.  The model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details.  This guarantees uniformity in the management of OAM protocols and provides support for nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different levels through a unified interface)</description>
