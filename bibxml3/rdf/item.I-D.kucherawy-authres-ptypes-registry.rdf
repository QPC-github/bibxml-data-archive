    <title>"A Property Types Registry for the Authentication-Results Header Field", Murray Kucherawy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kucherawy-authres-ptypes-registry-00.txt</link>
    <description>[RFC7001] describes a header field called Authentication-Results for use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results of message authentication efforts.  Any receiver-side software, such as mail filters or Mail User Agents (MUAs), can use this header field to relay that information in a convenient and meaningful way to users, or make sorting and filtering decisions.  One portion of the definition in that document limits the types of authentication properties about a message to a small, fixed set. This document updates the specification to allow new property types to be declared and used.</description>
