    <title>"Tagging Customer Bridge Domains in VPLS", Mingui Zhang, Liang Xia, Jie Hu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-l2vpn-vpls-bd-tagging-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes to use Customer VLAN ID as an identifier for traffic isolation in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS). In this way, multiple bridge domains of customers can share a single VPLS instance while their traffic are separated. With this proposal, Service Providers can be relieved from the heavy provisioning overhead of large number of pseudowires in the environment where a mass of bridge domains need be connected.</description>
