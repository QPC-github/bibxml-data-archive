    <title>"Policy-Mandated Labels Such as "Adv:" in Email Subject Headers Considered  Ineffective At Best", Carl Malamud</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-malamud-subject-line-05.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet-Draft discusses policies that require certain labels to be inserted in the "Subject:" header of a mail message. Such policies are difficult to specify accurately while remaining compliant with key RFCs and are likely to be ineffective at best. This Internet-Draft discusses an alternate, standards-compliant approach that is significantly simpler to specify and is somewhat less likely to be ineffective.</description>
