    <description>A multihomed host receives node configuration information from each of its access networks.  Some configuration objects are global to the node, some are local to the interface.  Various issues arise when multiple conflicting node-scoped configuration objects are received on multiple interfaces.  Similar situations also happen with single interface host connected to multiple networks.  This document describes these issues.</description>
