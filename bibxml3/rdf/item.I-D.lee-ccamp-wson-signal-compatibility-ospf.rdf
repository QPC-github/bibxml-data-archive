    <title>"OSPF Enhancement for Signal and Network Element Compatibility for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks", Young Lee, Greg Bernstein</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lee-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support signal compatibility constraints associated with WSON network elements. These routing enhancements are required in common optical or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the optical signals in the network are compatible with all network elements participating in the network.  This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.</description>
