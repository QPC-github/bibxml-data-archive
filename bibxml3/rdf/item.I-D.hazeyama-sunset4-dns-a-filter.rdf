    <description>Filtering out of A records of a DNS response on a DNS proxy, we call it ``DNS A record filtering'', is an effective and efficient solution as a smooth migration to IPv6 only networks.  DNS A record filtering can mitigate fallback problems of dual stack nodes on IPv6 only environment.  This memo mentions the components of the DNS A record filter solution, procedure of DNS queries and refers current issues.</description>
