        <description>This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) Source Active routes and customer Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) Source Active routes, which is useful for MVPN provider networks offering services to customers with an existing MSDP infrastructure.  Without the procedures described in this document, VPN-specific MSDP sessions are required among the PEs that are customer MSDP peers.  This document updates RFC6514.</description>
