    <description>Address Resolution Protocol in IPv5 is basically the same as in IPv4, and it is intended to resolve Data Link Layer Ethernet addresses to Network Layer IP-FF addresses,  in addition to Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), includes optional duplicate MAC address detection. This spec was written for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet links or compatible. Separate specifications may be required for other link types.</description>
