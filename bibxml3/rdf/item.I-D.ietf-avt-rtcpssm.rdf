    <title>"RTCP Extensions for Single-Source Multicast Sessions with Unicast Feedback", Joerg Ott, Julian Chesterfield</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-avt-rtcpssm-19.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback to a multicast sender. The proposed extension is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) communication where the traditional model of many-to-many group communication is either not available or not desired. In addition, it can be applied to any group that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized reporting mechanism.</description>
