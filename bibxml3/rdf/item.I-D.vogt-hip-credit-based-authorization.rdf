    <title>"Credit-Based Authorization for HIP Mobility with Concurrent IP-Address  Tests", Christian Vogt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vogt-hip-credit-based-authorization-00.txt</link>
    <description>End-host mobility with the Host Identity Protocol uses IP-address tests to protect against malicious packet redirection and third-party flooding. The tests cause handover signaling delays to increase by one round-trip time. This document proposes a credit-based strategy that allows peers to securely resume active communications after handover as soon as possible, and to pursue a concurrent IP-address test subsequently. The optimization thus eliminates the additional handover delay that IP-address tests entail.</description>
