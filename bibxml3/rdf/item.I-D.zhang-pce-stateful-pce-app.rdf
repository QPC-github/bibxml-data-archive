    <title>"Applicability of Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE)", Xian Zhang, Ina Minei</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-pce-stateful-pce-app-04.txt</link>
    <description>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits through a number of use cases.  Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</description>
