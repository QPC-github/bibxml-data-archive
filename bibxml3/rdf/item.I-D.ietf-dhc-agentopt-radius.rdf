    <description>A NAS (network access server) may choose to authenticate the identity of a device before granting that device access to the network. The IEEE 802.1X protocol is an example of a mechanism for providing authenticated layer 2 network access. A network element using RADIUS as an authentication authority will receive attributes from a RADIUS server that may be used by a DHCP server in the selection of configuration parameters to be delivered to the device through its DHCP client. The RADIUS Attributes sub-option enables a network element to pass along attributes for the user of a device received during RADIUS authentication to a DHCP server.</description>
