    <description>This document defines firstly functionality levels for IoT devices that describe the device capabilities at the granularity of devices, objects and resources.  It additionally presents a metric to measure the functional similarity between the manageable properties of any two IoT devices, called Functionality Distance (FD), which is defined as the indication of the extent to which one device can be substituted for the other.</description>
