    <title>"Additional Data related to a Call for Emergency Call Purposes", Brian Rosen, Hannes Tschofenig</title>

    <description>When an emergency call is sent to a PSAP, the device that sends it, as well as any service provider in the path of the call may have information about the call which the PSAP may be able to use.  This document describes an XML data structure that contains this kind of information in a standardized form.  A URI that points to the structure can be included in the SIP signaling with the call.</description>
