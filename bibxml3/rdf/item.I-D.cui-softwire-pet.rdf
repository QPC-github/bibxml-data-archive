    <description>IPv4 and IPv6 are expected to coexist for a long period.  Currently, there are many IPv4/IPv6 transition/coexistence techniques, roughly divided into the categories of tunneling and translation.  Tunneling and translation have respective application scopes, and translation has some technical limitations, including scalability issue, application layer translation, operation complexity, etc.  To improve the availability of translation, this draft proposes the method of selecting appropriate translation spot to execute translation.  When the translation spot is not on IPv4-IPv6 border, tunnel is used to achieve the traversing between translation spot and IP border.  This method applies well in mesh scenario where both IPv4 and IPv6 client network exists, and BGP can be extended to achieve a translation spot signaling.</description>
