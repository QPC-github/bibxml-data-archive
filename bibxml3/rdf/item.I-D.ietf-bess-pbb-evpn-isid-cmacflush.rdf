        <description>Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to deploy Ethernet Local Area Network (ELAN) services in large Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks (PBB-EVPN).  Single- Active Multi-homing and per-I-SID (per Service Instance Identifier) Load-Balancing can be provided to access devices and aggregation networks.  In order to speed up the network convergence in case of failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed Ethernet Segments, PBB-EVPN defines a flush mechanism for Customer MACs (CMAC-flush) that works for different Ethernet Segment Backbone MAC (BMAC) address allocation models.  This document complements those CMAC-flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN Ethernet Segments are defined (the attachment circuit is associated to a zero Ethernet Segment Identifier) and a Service Instance Identifier based (I-SID-based) CMAC-flush granularity is required.</description>
