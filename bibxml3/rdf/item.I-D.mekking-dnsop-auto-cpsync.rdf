    <title>"Automated (DNSSEC) Child Parent Synchronization using DNS UPDATE", Matthijs Mekking</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mekking-dnsop-auto-cpsync-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a way to synchronise existing trust anchors automatically between a child zone and its parent.  The protocol can be used for other Resource Records that are required to delegate from a parent to a child such as NS and glue records.  The synchronization allows for a third party to be involved, thus the protocol is suitable for both cases, whether you have to communicate to the registry or to the registrar.</description>
