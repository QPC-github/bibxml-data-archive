    <title>"Proposed Refactoring of JOSE to Align Encryption and Key Wrapping", Richard Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-jose-key-wrapping-01.txt</link>
    <description>The discussions around key wrapping in the JOSE working group have raised new requirements for wrapped keys, namely: (1) Wrapping keys other than symmetric keys, (2) cryptographically binding attributes to keys, and (3) allowing the use of AEAD cryptographic algorithms for key wrapping (other than AES-KW).  This document proposes a refactoring of the JOSE document set that provides a cleaner conceptual structure for JWS / JWE and transparent support for wrapped keys, all with a relatively minor impact on the compact form of JWS and JWE objects.</description>
