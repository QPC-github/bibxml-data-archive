    <title>"Lightweight Industrial CMP Profile", Hendrik Brockhaus, Steffen Fries, David von Oheimb</title>

    <description>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [RFC4210] and the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) [RFC4211].  It specifies a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing on typical uses cases relevant for managing certificates of devices in industrial and IoT scenarios.  To limit the overhead of certificate management for constrained devices only the most crucial types of transactions are specified as mandatory.  To foster interoperability also in more complex scenarios, other types of transactions are specified as recommended or optional.</description>
