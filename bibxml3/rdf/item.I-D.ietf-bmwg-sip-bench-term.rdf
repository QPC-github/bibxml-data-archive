    <title>"Terminology for Benchmarking Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Devices: Basic session setup and registration", Carol Davids, Vijay Gurbani, Scott Poretsky</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-bmwg-sip-bench-term-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance of devices.  Methodology related to benchmarking SIP devices is described in the companion methodology document.  Using these two documents, benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Servers, Registrars and Session Border Controllers.  The term "performance" in this context means the capacity of the device-under- test (DUT) to process SIP messages.  Media streams are used only to study how they impact the signaling behavior.  The intent of the two documents is to provide a normalized set of tests that will enable an objective comparison of the capacity of SIP devices.  Test setup parameters and a methodology is necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements.  A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures.</description>
