    <description>This document provides an overview of the MPLS-TP OAM toolset, which consists of MPLS-TP fault management and performance monitoring. This overview includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions, and of the generic mechanisms created in the MPLS data plane to support in-band OAM. The importance of using IANA assigned code point under G-Ach when supporting MPLS-TP OAM is also discussed. The protocol definitions for each individual MPLS-TP OAM tool are specified in separate RFCs or Working Group documents which are referenced by this document.</description>
