    <description>The Source Address Selection Policy option of DHCPv6 provides a mechanism for notifying end nodes of information about source address selection policies. This makes it possible for an end node to set up a connection without concern for transfer failures due to ingress filtering by ISPs, for ISP operators to manage user behavior and networking policy, and for consumers to be provided with networks that are almost automatically robust and reliable.</description>
