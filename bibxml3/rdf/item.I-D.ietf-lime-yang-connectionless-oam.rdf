    <description>This document presents a base YANG Data model for the management of Operations Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols that use Connectionless Communications.  The data model is defined using the YANG, as specified in RFC7950 data modeling language.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication.  The base model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details.  There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols.  And second, it support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).</description>
