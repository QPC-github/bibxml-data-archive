    <title>"Cisco Systems' Solution for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs", Yiqun Cai, Eric Rosen, IJsbrand Wijnands</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosen-vpn-mcast-15.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes the MVPN (Multicast in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) solution designed and deployed by Cisco Systems.  The procedures specified in this draft are largely a subset of the generalized MVPN framework recently standardized by the IETF.  However, as the deployment of the procedures specified herein pre-dates the publication of IETF standards (in some cases by over five years), an implementation based on these procedures differs in some respects from a fully standards-compliant implementation.  These differences are pointed out in the document.</description>
