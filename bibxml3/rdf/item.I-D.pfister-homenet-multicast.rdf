    <title>"Multicast enabled Home Network using PIM-SSBIDIR and HNCP", Pierre Pfister</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pfister-homenet-multicast-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a possible solution enabling multicast routing in a home network.  It relies on the Source-Specific Bidirectional variant of the Protocol Independent Multicast routing protocol (PIM-SSBIDIR).  HNCP is used to elect the Rendezvous Point address and a Proxy Controller connected to the Rendezvous Point Link.  Additionally, PIM-SSBIDIR routers behavior is slightly modified on the Rendezvous Point Link so that the Proxy Controller may know the home-wide subscription state.  Note that this document defines one single working solution to the stated problem: Inputs regarding other possibilities are welcome.</description>
