    <title>"Distributing OpenPGP Key Fingerprints with Signed Keylist Subscriptions", R. McCain, Micah Lee, Nat Welch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mccain-keylist-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe to an organization's public keylist to keep its keystore up-to-date with correct keys from the correct keyserver(s), even in cases where the keys correspond to multiple (potentially uncontrolled) domains.  Ensuring that all members or followers of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining operational security.  Without the most recent keys' fingerprints and a source of trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users must manually update and sign each others' keys -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations. This document proposes a experimental format for the keylist file as well as requirements for clients who wish to implement this experimental keylist subscription functionality.</description>
