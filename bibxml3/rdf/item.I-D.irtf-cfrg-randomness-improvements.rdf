    <description>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related security protocols.  Weak or predictable "cryptographically-strong" pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes.  An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems.  This document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys.  This improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.  This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</description>
