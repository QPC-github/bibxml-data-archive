        <description>This document describes an information model and the corresponding YANG data model for the Consumer-Facing Interface of the Security Controller in an Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) system in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.  The information model defines various types of managed objects and the relationship among them needed to build the flow policies from users' perspective.  This information model is based on the "Event- Condition-Action" (ECA) policy model defined by a capability information model for I2NSF, and the YANG data model is defined for enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to define, manage, and monitor flow policies within an administrative domain.</description>
