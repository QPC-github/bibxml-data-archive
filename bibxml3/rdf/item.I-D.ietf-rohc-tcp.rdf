    <title>"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Profile for TCP/IP (ROHC-TCP)", Ghyslain  Pelletier</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rohc-tcp-16.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for compression of TCP/IP packets. The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient and robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP options such as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments) and Timestamps. ROHC-TCP works well when used over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times. For many bandwidth-limited links where header compression is essential, such characteristics are common.</description>
