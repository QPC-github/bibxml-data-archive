    <description>This document summarizes the existing approaches for name resolution in various ICN architectures, and categorizes them into two groups: (1) standalone name resolution; (2) name based routing. It compares the two types of approaches from the aspects of update message overhead, resolution capability, node failure impact, and maintained database. And hybrid approaches also exist with a subnet of routers carrying out name based routing. Despite the coexistence of different name resolution approaches, the Name Resolution Service (NRS) is most essential service that shall be provided by the ICN infrastructure. The document gives the definition of NRS in ICN and proposes some requirements of NRS, i.e. resolution guarantee, delay sensitivity, minimum inter-domain traffic, failure resilience, accuracy, security and accessibility, scalability, and time transiency, support for manifest, interoperability, resolution result selection, heterogeneity, unspecified Content Name.</description>
