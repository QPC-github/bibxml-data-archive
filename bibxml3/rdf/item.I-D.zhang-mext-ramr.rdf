    <description>The Router Advertisement message in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol [2] contains an 8-bit field reserved for single-bit flags. Several protocols have reserved flags in this field and others are preparing to reserve a sufficient number of flags to exhaust the field. This document defines a flag to the Router Advertisement message that extends the available number of flag bits available. The extended flag defined in this document is mainly used by Mobile Router to identify its location.</description>
