    <description>SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for enabling global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  New methods have been devised for accurate delivery of packets from the global Internet into the internal domain of destinations that do not share a common address space with the majority of the global Internet.  These improvements can be used to augment Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy can be achieved in many common cases of interest.</description>
