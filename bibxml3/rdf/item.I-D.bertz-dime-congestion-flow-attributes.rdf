    <title>"Diameter Congestion and Filter Attributes", Brent Hirschman, Lyle Bertz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bertz-dime-congestion-flow-attributes-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines optional ECN and filter related attributes that can be used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and minimized filter administration within Diameter.  RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule AVP that accommodates extensions for classification, conditions and actions. It does not support traffic identification for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification as defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions when the flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule are congested.  A Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the exact number of flows. Flow count and other associated data (e.g. packets) is not captured in Accounting applications, leaving administrators without useful information regarding the effectiveness or understanding of the filter definition.  These optional attributes are forward and backwards compatible with RFC 5777.</description>
