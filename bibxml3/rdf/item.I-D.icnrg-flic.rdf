    <title>"File-Like ICN Collection (FLIC)", Christian Tschudin, Christopher Wood</title>

    <description>This document describes a bare bones "index table"-approach for organizing a set of ICN data objects into a large, File-Like ICN Collection (FLIC).  At the core of this collection is a so called manifest which acts as the collection's root node.  The manifest contains an index table with pointers, each pointer being a hash value pointing to either a final data block or another index table node.</description>
