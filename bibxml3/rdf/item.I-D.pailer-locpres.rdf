    <title>"A Location Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Rudolf Pailer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pailer-locpres-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of location presence. Presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network. Presence data is general information about the state of a user like "on-line" and "off-line". Location presence extends conventional presence by taking the physical location of a user into account. Location presence is information about the geographical position of a user. Subscriptions and notifications of location presence are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event notification framework. This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence Profile (CPP) framework.</description>
