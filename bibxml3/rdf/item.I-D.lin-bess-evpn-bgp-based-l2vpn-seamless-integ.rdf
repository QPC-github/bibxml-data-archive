    <description>This document presents a seamless integration solution for BGP-based Layer-2 VPN (L2VPN) and EVPN to provide point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS).  In addition, this document also extends the existing seamless integration for multipoint Ethernet VPN service with all-active multihoming support.  The specified solution allows the coexistence of EVPN and L2VPN services under the same point-to- point or multipoint VPN instance.  By using this seamless integration solution, a service provider can introduce EVPN into their existing L2VPN network or migrate from an existing L2VPN based network to EVPN.</description>
