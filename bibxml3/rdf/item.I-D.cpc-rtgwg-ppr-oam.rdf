    <description>This document defines OAM and traffic accounting capabilities for Preferred Path Routing (PPR) for IS-IS and OSPF protocols. Specifically, this document specifies OAM capabilities that allow to assert proper PPR connectivity and to trace PPR path information.  In addition, a set of statistics and operational data to facilitate PPR traffic accounting on a per-PPR path basis are defined.  This includes a number of Information Elements that extend IPFIX to export path information, as well as a YANG Data Model to be used in conjunction with management and control protocols.  Collectively the capabilities defined in this document provide network operators with the necessary means to ensure proper working of their PPR deployments.</description>
