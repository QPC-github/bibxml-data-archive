    <title>"Use of IP Router Alert Considered Dangerous", Reshad Rahman, David Ward</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rahman-rtg-router-alert-dangerous-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides guidelines to address security concerns which arise with the use of IP Router Alert option [RFC2113] and [RFC2711]. RSVP,[RFC2205] and [RFC3209], and IGMP [RFC3376] are some of the protocols which make use of the IP Router Alert option. IP datagrams carrying the Router Alert option are usually examined in a router's "slow path" and an excess of such datagrams can cause performance degradation or packet drops in a router's "slow path".</description>
