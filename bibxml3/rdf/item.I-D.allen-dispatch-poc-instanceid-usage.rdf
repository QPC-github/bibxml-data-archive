    <title>"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Instance ID usage by the Open Mobile Alliance Push-to-talk over Cellular", Andrew Allen, Alan Soloway</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-allen-dispatch-poc-instanceid-usage-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how the SIP Instance ID as defined in RFC 5626 [1] is used by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), for Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) and Push-to-Communicate for Public Safety (PCPS) and addresses security concerns with use of the SIP instance ID in non-register requests and responses.  This document updates RFC 7255 [2] to allow the use of the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) as an instance ID in the Contact header field of non-register requests and responses by the OMA PoC and PCPS enablers for the purposes described in this document.</description>
