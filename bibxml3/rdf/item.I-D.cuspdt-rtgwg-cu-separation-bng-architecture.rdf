    <description>This document defines an architecture for Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) devices with control plane (CP) and user plane (UP) separation. A BNG-CP is a user control management component while a BNG-UP takes responsibility as the network edge and user policy implementation component. Both BNG-CP and BNG-UP are core components for fixed broadband services and are deployed separately at different network layers.</description>
