    <title>""Pending" Responses for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)", Peter van der Stok, Klaus Hartke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hartke-core-pending-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a new type of response for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) called a "Pending" response.  A CoAP server can use a Pending response to indicate that it has accepted a request but has not yet started processing it or that processing the request will take longer than a client is typically willing to wait for a response.</description>
