    <description>This document defines concepts and terminology for use of the Session Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar function is replaced by a distributed mechanism that might be implemented using a distributed hash table or other distributed data mechanism with similar external properties. This document includes a high-level view of the functional relationships between the network elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations, and an outline of the related open problems that might be addressed by an IETF working group.</description>
