    <title>"An Enhanced Media Delivery Index (eMDI) based on TCP", ding xiaojian, Qin Wu, Rong Gu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ding-tcp-emdi-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces an Enhanced Media Delivery Index (eMDI) that can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended to deliver streaming media over TCP transport.  It aims to address the problems that RFC4445 has when measuring in environments where TCP traffic is dominated as a transport for streaming media.</description>
