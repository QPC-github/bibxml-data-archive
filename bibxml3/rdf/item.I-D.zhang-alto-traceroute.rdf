    <title>"P2P Traffic Localization by Traceroute and 2-Means Classification", Yunfei  Zhang, Liufei Wen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-alto-traceroute-02.txt</link>
    <description>Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between the randomly constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical network topology, causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT time. This document describes how DHT overlay peers can interact with the routers by traceroute to get the path information, and execute 2- Means Classification, thereafter peers leverage the DHT itself to    build efficient "closer" cluster. This scheme only requires the infrastructure to enable traceroute queries.</description>
