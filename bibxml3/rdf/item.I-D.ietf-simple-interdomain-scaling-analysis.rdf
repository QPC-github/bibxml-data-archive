    <description>This document analyzes the traffic that is generated by presence subscriptions between domains and shows that the amount of traffic can be extremely large.  This document also analyzes the effects of a large presence system on the memory footprint and the CPU load. Approved and in-work optimizations to the Session Initiation Protocol are analyzed, considering the possible impact on the load.  Separate documents contain the requirements for optimizations and suggestions for new optimizations.</description>
