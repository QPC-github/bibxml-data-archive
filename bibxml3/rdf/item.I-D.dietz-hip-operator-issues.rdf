    <description>This document discuss the potential issues that arise when the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) will be introduced in a operator network, especially in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) of the 3GPP systems. It discusses mobile network specific issues like charging, lawful interception as well as common issues like where to associate the HIP ID or privacy issues. The document tries to make the HIP community aware of those issues and wants to stimulate discussion on those topics.</description>
