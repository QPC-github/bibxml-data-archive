    <title>"Security and Reliable Multicast Transport Protocols: Discussions and Guidelines", Brian Adamson, Vincent Roca, Hitoshi Asaeda</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rmt-sec-discussion-08.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes general security considerations for Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building blocks and protocols.  An emphasis is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport protocol design.  However, relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed.  The document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be embraced to mitigate these risks.  The purpose of this document is to provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for further discussions and potential resolution of any significant security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.</description>
