    <description>This draft describes extended performance statistics for TCP. They are designed to use TCP's ideal vantage point to diagnose performance problems in both the network and the application. If a network based application is performing poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck is in the sender, the receiver or the network itself. If the bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific information about its nature.</description>
