    <description>A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static configuration and does not consider the link characteristics of that interface, which may affect the user experience.  This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to query the link characteristics from the access router (the router at the other end of the endpoint's access link) using a Port Control Protocol (PCP) Flow Extension.  This information influences endpoint's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidate selection algorithm.</description>
