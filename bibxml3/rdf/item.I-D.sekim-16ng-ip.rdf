    <title>"IP Transmission over IEEE 802.16 Networks", Sang-Eon Kim, Joo Yoon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sekim-16ng-ip-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes IP packet transmission over IEEE 802.16 network to access Internet with PMP mode based IP CS.  IP CS is a payload of IPv4 packet and IPv6 packet over IEEE 802.16 frame.  This draft introduces host based packet delivery mechanism that can be classified layer 2 forwarding and IP tunnel based on public service and trial on IEEE 802.16 network.  It describes HBPD on IEEE 802.16, requirements of the network elements and how to control IP CS on the IEEE 802.16.</description>
