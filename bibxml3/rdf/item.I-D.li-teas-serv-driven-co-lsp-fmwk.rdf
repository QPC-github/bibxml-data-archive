    <description>MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) has been widely deployed to satifisfy all kinds of requirements of traffic engineering for transport of services.  Complexity of configuration has much negative effect on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale network.  The document identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment and proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the setup of co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths(TE LSPs) is triggered by the bidirectional service.  Then the document proposes the framework for setting up service-driven co-routed MPLS TE LSP for L2VPN and L3VPN.</description>
