    <title>"Consistent Modeling of Operational State Data in YANG", Rob Shakir, Anees Shaikh, Marcus Hines</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-openconfig-netmod-opstate-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an approach for modeling configuration and operational state data in YANG [RFC6020] that is geared toward network management systems that require capabilities beyond those typically envisioned in a NETCONF-based management system.  The document presents the requirements of such systems and proposes a modeling approach to meet these requirements, along with implications and design patterns for modeling operational state in YANG.</description>
