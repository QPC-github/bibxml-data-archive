    <description>The RPL specification allows nodes running with storing or non- storing modes to operate in the same network.  We describe how such a mix can result in network partitioning even when there are plenty of physical links available in the network.  The partitioning affects both upwards (nodes to root) and downwards (root to leaf) traffic. This routing pathology stems from a recommendation made in the RPL specification forcing nodes with different modes of operation to join the RPL network as leaf nodes only.  We propose a solution that modifies RPL by mandating that all the nodes parse and interpret source routing headers and storing mode nodes to sometimes act like a non-storing mode root by attaching source routing headers.</description>
