    <title>"Requirements for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Routing  for the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON)", Lyndon Ong, Janathan Sadler, Stephen Shew</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-many-ccamp-4258bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different applications.  These include support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).  This document concentrates on the routing requirements placed on the GMPLS suite of protocols in order to support the capabilities and functionalities of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
