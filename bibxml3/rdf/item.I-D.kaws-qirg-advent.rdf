    <description>This document describes the use of link-state routing protocols on classical links in Quantum Networks.  It contains proposals for additions to the IS-IS and OSPF protocols in order for them to transport relevant information for a Quantum Network, specifically, for the creation and manipulation of entangled pairs.  The document will describe some of the necessary attributes and some suggestions of how this information may be used.  No Schrodinger's cats were harmed in the creation of this document.</description>
