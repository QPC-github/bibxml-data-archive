    <description>In networks depending on edge-to-edge establishment of MPLS forwarding paths via LDP, blackholing of traffic can occur in situations where the IGP is operational on a link and thus the link is used for IP forwarding but LDP is not operational on that link for whatever reason. This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.</description>
