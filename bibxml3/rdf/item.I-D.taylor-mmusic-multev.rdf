    <title>"Signalling the Ability To Understand Packing of Multiple Telephony Events  Into One RTP Packet", Tom Taylor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-taylor-mmusic-multev-00.txt</link>
    <description>Section 2.5.1.5 of RFC 4733 specifies how an implementation of the telephony-event payload type can pack multiple short-duration event reports into one RTP packet. Because this capability was added to RFC 4733 in a fashion which is not backward compatible with RFC 2833, it is desirable that a sender have the means to determine whether the receiver understands such packets. This memo specifies a new SDP attribute, a=multev, to indicate that capability.</description>
