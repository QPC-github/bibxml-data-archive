    <title>"A Configuration Profile Schema for LDAP-based agents", Bob Joslin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-joslin-config-schema-17.txt</link>
    <description>This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents that make use of the Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and a proposed use case of that schema, for distributed configuration of similar directory user agents. A set of attribute types and an objectclass are proposed. In the proposed use case, directory user agents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory data location and access parameters for specific services they support. In addition, in the proposed use case, attribute and objectclass mapping allows DUAs to re-configure their expected (default) schema to match that of the end user's environment. This document is intended to be a skeleton for future documents that describe configuration of specific DUA services.</description>
