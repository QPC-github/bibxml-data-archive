    <description>This documents defines the Lightweight Authenticated Time (LATe) Synchronization Protocol, a secure time synchronization protocol for constrained environments.  The messages are encoded using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and basic security services are provided by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).  A secure source of time is a base assumption for many other services, including security services.  LATe Synchronization protocol enables these time-dependent services to run in the context of a constrained environment.</description>
