    <description>The "Network Management Datastore Architecture" (NMDA) improves on NETCONF by adding new features to give more accurate handling of configuration and operational data.  These include ability to inspect the current operational values of configuration data, allowing clients to use identical paths for retrieving the configured values and the operational values.  These new features require additional operations in network management applications such as NETCONF.  This draft details those new operations.</description>
