    <title>"A Framework for Loop-free Convergence", Mike Shand, Stewart Bryant</title>

    <description>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop which may occur transiently among two or more routers in a hop by hop packet forwarding paradigm. This framework provides a summary of the causes and consequences of micro-loops and enables the reader to form a judgement on whether micro-looping is an issue that needs to be addressed in specific networks.  It also provides a survey of the currently proposed mechanisms that may be used to prevent or to suppress the formation of micro-loops when an IP or MPLS network undergoes topology change due to failure, repair or management action.  When sufficiently fast convergence is not available and the topology is susceptible to micro-loops, use of one or more of these mechanisms may be desirable.</description>
