    <description>In this document, procedures' considerations on the applicability of LDP MT for unicast fast-reroute using MRT are provided.  The behaviors of label allocation and label forwarding entry setup with LDP Multi-Topology and MRT fast-reroute are described in details. Different application scenarios of the combining of the LDP multi- topology(MT) and unicast fast-reroute using Maximally Redundant Trees(MRT) are also analyzed.</description>
