    <title>"Enabling Global Service Attributes in the Service Location Protocol", Weibin  Zhao, Henning Schulzrinne</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhao-slp-attr-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes enabling global service attributes in the Service Location Protocol (SLP). A global service attribute describes a service property common to all service types. Its name begins with the "service-" prefix. It is defined via an attribute template, and can be imported into any service template. A single Service Request (SrvRqst) message can use global service attributes to search services across multiple service types. Global service attributes can be associated with certain special characteristics so as to support advanced discovery scenarios, such as URL changes, multi-access-point services, multi-function devices and replicated services.</description>
