    <title>"Multi-Topology/Multi-Instance OSPFv3 for IPv4-Embedded IPv6", Mohammed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet, Dean Cheng, Yiu Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-ospf-v4v6-ospfv3-mt-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT IDs), based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and two new Instance Identifiers (MI IDs), based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt], respectively, in OSPFv3.  With these identifiers, an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology is maintained for both IPv6 unicast and multicast traffic.  The purpose of running separate instances or topologies for IPv4- Embedded IPv6 traffic is to distinguish from the native IPv6 routing topology, and the topology that is used for routing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 datagrams only.  Separate instances/topologies are also meant to prevent any overload of the native IPv6 routing tables by IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes.</description>
