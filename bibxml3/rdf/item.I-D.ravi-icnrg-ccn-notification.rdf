    <description>This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for CCN.  Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or multicast to multiple listening points.  Notifications do not expect a Content Object response hence only requires the use of FIB state in the CCN forwarder.  Emulating Notification as a PULL has performance and routing implications.  The draft first discusses the design choices associated with using current Interest/Data abstraction for achieving push and challenges associated with them.  We follow this by proposing a new fixed header primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using Content Object primitive to transport Notifications.  This discussion are presented in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.  The draft also provides discussions on various aspects related to notification such as flow and congestion control, routing and reliability considerations, and use case scenarios.</description>
