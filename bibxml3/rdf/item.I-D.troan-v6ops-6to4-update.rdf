    <title>"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4) as Last Resort", Ole Troan, Keith Moore, James Woodyatt</title>

    <description>Experience with the mechanism described in "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" [RFC3068] has shown that the mechanism is not a reliable means for communicating with resources in the public IPv6 Internet.  This limits the applicability of the "6to4" mechanism described in [RFC3056].</description>
