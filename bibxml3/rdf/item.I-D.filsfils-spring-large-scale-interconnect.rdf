    <description>This document describes an application of Segment Routing to scale the network to support hundreds of thousands of network nodes, and tens of millions of physical underlay endpoints.  This use-case can be applied to the interconnection of massive-scale DCs and/or large aggregation networks.  Forwarding tables of midpoint and leaf nodes only require a few tens of thousands of entries.  This may be achieved by inherert scaleable nature of Segment Routing and designed proposed in this document.</description>
