        <description>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension to BMP to convey the status of a BGP path before and after being processed by the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension makes use of the TLV mechanims described in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit [I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].</description>
