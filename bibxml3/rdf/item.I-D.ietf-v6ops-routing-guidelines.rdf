    <description>Guidelines on how to manage and filter IPv6 routes are needed for operators of networks, either providers or enterprises. It describes IPv6 routes from the protocol point of view. It does not discuss operational or policy issues such as the maximum length of prefixes to filter. This document is a followup on RFC2772 work but for the production IPv6 Internet. RFC2772 is obsoleted.</description>
