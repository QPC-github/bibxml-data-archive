    <description>This document suggests the necessity of an architectural framework for network telemetry in order to meet the current and future network operation requirements.  The defining characteristics of network telemetry shows a clear distinction from the conventional network OAM concept; hence the network telemetry demands new techniques and protocols.  This document clarifies the terminologies and classifies the categories and components of a network telemetry framework.  The requirements, challenges, existing solutions, and future directions are discussed for each category.  The network telemetry framework and the taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related works and put future technique and standard developments into perspective.</description>
