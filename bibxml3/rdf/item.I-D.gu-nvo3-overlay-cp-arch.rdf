    <title>"Analysis of external assistance to NVE and consideration of architecture", Gu Yingjie, Weiguo Hao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gu-nvo3-overlay-cp-arch-00.txt</link>
    <description>Draft [overlay-cp] has introduced some control plan requirements and characteristics.  From NVE's perspective, this draft describes what assistance is needed to make NVE satisfy the requirements and characteristics introduce in [overlay-cp].  Not all of these assistance is necessarily achieved by an external controller.  Some of the assistance requirements can be regarded as a complementarity requirements to [overlay-cp] . while others are requirements to an assistance Database.  This draft also provide considerations on how the network virtualization architecture should be like and how these assistance can be fulfilled.  The target is to help the working group to figure out the architecture of overlay control plane, instead of providing solutions.</description>
