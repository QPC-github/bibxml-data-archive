    <description>This document presents a solution suite for TRILL campuses to be connected over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to work within intra-data centers. Connecting different sites over WAN using overlay tunnel protocols is the primary method employed at present. Though this presents a simple mechanisms to extend TRILL campuses over WAN networks, it also brings in the problem of scalability for TRILL nicknames exchanged between sites, latency, duplication of traffic etc. This draft proposes a way to extend the TRILL sites without having the WAN network aware of TRILL campus network and its topology. This document details on how to extend TRILL campus sites and to establish connections between various sites without having to exchange entire TRILL campus information, thus reducing the information flow to the required sites only. This document do not add or define datacenter interconnect protocol.</description>
