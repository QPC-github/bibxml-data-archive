    <description>The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme "arib:" has been devised to allow acquiring the current or future scheduled publications of broadcast media content from the internet. These broadcast media contents are distributed with the MPEG-2 TS [ISO/IEC 13818-1] on the ISDB (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting) broadcast system, which is specified in the [ITU-R BT.1306] and [ITU-R BS.1114].</description>
