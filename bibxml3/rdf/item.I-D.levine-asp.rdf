    <description>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs).  The primary DKIM protocol is described in [RFC4871].  This document describes the records that authors can use to advertise their practices for signing their outgoing mail, and how other hosts can access those records.</description>
