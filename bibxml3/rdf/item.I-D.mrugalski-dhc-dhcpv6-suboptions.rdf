    <title>"Requesting Suboptions in DHCPv6", Tomasz Mrugalski</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mrugalski-dhc-dhcpv6-suboptions-04.txt</link>
    <description>DHCPv6 clients may use Option Request Option (ORO) defined in RFC3315 [RFC3315] to specify, which options they would like to have configured by DHCPv6 servers.  Clients may also be interested in specific options that do not appear in DHCPv6 message directly (top- level options), but rather as nested options or sub-options (i.e. options conveyed within other options).  This document clarifies how to use already defined ORO to request sub-options.  It also defines new Option Exclude Option (OXO) for cases, when client does not want requested options to appear within specific options.  This document updates RFC3315 (if approved).</description>
