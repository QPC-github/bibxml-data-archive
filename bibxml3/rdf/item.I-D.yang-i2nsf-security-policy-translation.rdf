        <description>This document proposes a scheme of security policy translation (i.e., Security Policy Translator) in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) Framework.  When I2NSF User delivers a high-level security policy for a security service, Security Policy Translator in Security Controller translates it into a low-level security policy for Network Security Functions (NSFs).  For this security policy translation, this document specifies the mapping between a high-level security policy based on the Consumer-Facing Interface YANG data model and a low-level security policy based on the NSF-Facing Interface YANG data model.  Also, it describes an architecture of a security policy translator along with an NSF database, and the process of security policy translation with the NSF database.</description>
