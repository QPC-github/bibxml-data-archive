    <description>This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) uses when handling assignment and other requests related to the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry.  It also discusses the rationale and principles behind these procedures and how they facilitate the long-term sustainability of the registry.  This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting the previous UDP and TCP port assignment procedures defined in Sections 8 and 9.1 of the IANA allocation guidelines [RFC2780], and it updates the IANA Service Name and Port assignment procedures for UDP-Lite [RFC3828], DCCP [RFC4340] [RFC5595] and SCTP [RFC4960].  It also updates the DNS SRV specification [RFC2782] to clarify what a service name is and how it is registered.</description>
