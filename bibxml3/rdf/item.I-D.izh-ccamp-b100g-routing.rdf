    <description>This document describes Open Shortest Path First - Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE) routing protocol extensions to support GMPLS control of Optical Transport Networks (OTNs) specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.709 published in 2016.  The 2016 version of G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016] introduces support for higher rate OTU signals, termed OTUCn (which have a nominal rate of 100n Gbps).  The newly introduced OTUCn represent a very powerful extension to the OTN capabilities, and one which naturally scales to transport any newer clients with bit rates in excess of 100G, as they are introduced. This document extends the mechanisms defined in [RFC7138].</description>
