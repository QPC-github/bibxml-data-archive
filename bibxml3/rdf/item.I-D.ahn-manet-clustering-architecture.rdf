    <description>This document describes the architecture for clustering in the MANET which can be an efficient communication structure for the case when MANET nodes have the tendency of forming groups. In this type of MANET, each group of nodes forms a cluster which is represented by a cluster head. In this draft, we define the terminology for the MANET clustering and the related communication procedure.</description>
