    <title>"A stateless Ping tool for simple tests of GIMPS implementations", Ingo  Juchem</title>

    <description>When implementing signaling protocols such as GIMPS, implementors need a way to test the functionality and measure the performance of their own implementations. In this document, we try to provide a sketch for such a testing tool, a simple, stateless "Ping" NSLP, which works similar to ICMP Ping. This tool is able to traverse a path from a source to a destination along signaling aware network nodes and collect various data that could be useful for identifying each node it is passing.</description>
