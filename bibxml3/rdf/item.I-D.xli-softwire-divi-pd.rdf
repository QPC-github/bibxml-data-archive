    <description>This document presents the address specifications and deployment considerations of address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix delegation (dIVI-pd).  The dIVI-pd keeps the features of stateless, end-to-end address transparency and bidirectional-initiated communications of the original stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation, while it can utilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively.  In addition, it does not require the DNS64 and ALG, and can be used with prefix delegation.</description>
