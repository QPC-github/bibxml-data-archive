        <description>This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained node networks (6lo) and provides practical deployment examples.  In addition to IEEE Std 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), Bluetooth Low Energy, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and PLC are used as examples.  The document targets an audience who would like to understand and evaluate running end-to-end IPv6 over the constrained node networks for local or Internet connectivity.</description>
