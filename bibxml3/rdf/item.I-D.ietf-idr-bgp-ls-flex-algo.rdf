        <description>Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows routing protocols (viz. OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-defined (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics.  The computation is performed by routers participating in the specific network in a distribute manner using a Flex Algorithm definition.  This definition provisioned on one or more routers and propagated (viz.  OSPF and IS- IS flooding) through the network.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology information from the network.  This draft defines extensions to BGP- LS address-family to advertise the Flexible Algorithm Definition as a part of the topology information from the network.</description>
