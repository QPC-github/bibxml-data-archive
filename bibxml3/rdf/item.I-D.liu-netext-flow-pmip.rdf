    <description>PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requries no changes to the UE.  There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support flow mobility.  Flow mobility requries the UE and the network having communication protocol to carry the flow control messages.  This document proposes to use the extended IKEv2 protocol to carry the flow control messages between the UE and network.</description>
