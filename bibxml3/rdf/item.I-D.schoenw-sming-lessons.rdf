    <title>"Protocol Independent Network Management Data Modeling Languages - Lessons  Learned from the SMIng Project", Juergen Schoenwaelder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schoenw-sming-lessons-01.txt</link>
    <description>A data modeling language for network management protocols called SMIng was developed within the Network Management Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force over a period of several years. This memo documents some of the lessons learned during the project for consideration by designers of future data modeling languages for network management protocols.</description>
