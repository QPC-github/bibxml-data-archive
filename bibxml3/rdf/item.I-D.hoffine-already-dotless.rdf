    <title>"Top-Level Domains that Are Already Dotless", John Levine, Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffine-already-dotless-05.txt</link>
    <description>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have address records in them (so-called "dotless domains").  In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with dotless domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them.  This document lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.</description>
