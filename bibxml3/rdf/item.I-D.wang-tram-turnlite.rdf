    <title>"A Lightweight TURN Architecture and Specification (TURN-Lite)", Aijun Wang, Bing Liu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-tram-turnlite-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture called TURN-Lite which could simplify the data communication process between two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices.  The key mechanism in TURN-Lite is the newly defined "Couple" operation (using STUN [RFC5389] message format) which allows the TURN-Lite servers to be easily incorporated into existing CGN devices/CDN nodes which are already deployed within the network in a distributed manner.</description>
