    <title>"Network initiated handover in fast mobile IPv6", Telemaco Melia</title>

    <description>Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover. Several proposals [5] and [6] were made in order to improve the handover delay to support real-time traffic, such as Voice over IP. These proposals keep a fundamental characteristic of Mobile IP, namely the handover process is triggered by the Mobile Terminal. This document expands this concept to cover situations where the handover has to be performed by network management issues, such as spectrum allocation. The document describes a control architecture based on the policy management.</description>
