    <description>A good congestion control for data centers (DC) should provide low latency, fast convergence and high link utilization.  Since multiple applications with different requirements may run on the DC network it is important to provide fairness between different applications that may use different congestion algorithms.  An important issue from the user perspective is to achieve short Flow Completion Time (FCT). This document proposes data center congestion control direction aiming to achieve high performance while proving fairness.</description>
