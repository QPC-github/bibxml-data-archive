    <description>This document is in response to RFC3942 [1], and describes the use by PXELINUX of some DHCP Option Codes [2] numbering from 208-211. These codes were designated 'Site Local' [3] prior to this action, and are redefined by RFC3942 as available for allocation as standard DHCP Options.</description>
