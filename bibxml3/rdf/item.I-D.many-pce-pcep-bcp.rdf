    <description>A core standards track RFC defines the main underlying mechanisms, basic object format and message structure of the Path Computation Element (PCE) Communications Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP has been later extended in several RFCs, focusing on specific functionalities.  The proliferation of such companion RFCs may cause ambiguity when implementing a PCE based solution.  This document aims at documenting best current practices and at providing a reference RBNF grammar for PCEP messages, including object ordering and precedence rules.</description>
