    <title>"CastGate: an auto-tunneling architecture for IP Multicast", Pieter  Liefooghe</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liefooghe-castgate-02.txt</link>
    <description>The architecture described in this document aims at giving as many unicast-only end-users access to IP multicast content, this without the need for their ISPs to upgrade their network infrastructure to IP multicast. It further does not require any change to the unicast only infrastructure nor to the end-user operating systems. The access that is provided, is from a user's perspective as good as a real IP multicast connection. It can be used to send and receive ASM content and allows the receptions of SSM content. It further allows applying Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) to IP Multicast.</description>
