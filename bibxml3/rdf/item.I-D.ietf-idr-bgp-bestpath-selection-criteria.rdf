    <description>BGP specification (RFC4271) prescribes 'BGP next-hop reachability' as one of the key 'Route Resolvability Condition' that must be satisfied before the BGP bestpath candidate selection. This condition, however, may not be sufficient (as explained in the Appendix section) and would desire further granularity.  This document defines enhances the "Route Resolvability Condition" to facilitate the next-hop to be resolved in the chosen data plane.</description>
