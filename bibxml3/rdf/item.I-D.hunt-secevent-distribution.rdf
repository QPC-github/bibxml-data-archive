    <title>"SET Token Delivery Using HTTP", Phil Hunt, Marius Scurtescu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hunt-secevent-distribution-01.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines how a series of security event tokens (SETs) may be delivered to a previously registered receiver using HTTP over TLS.  The specification defines the metadata the an Event Transmitter uses to describe the Event Receiver's HTTP endpoint and the SET token delivery configuration.  The specification defines how the Event Receiver may check the current configuration metadata and delivery status using HTTP GET over TLS.  The specification also defines how delivery can be assured subject to the SET Token Receiver's need for assurance.</description>
