    <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard  ITU-T  Recommendation  H.265  and  ISO/IEC  International Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP flows.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.</description>
