    <title>"An abstract interface between applications and IPsec", Michael Richardson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-btns-abstract-api-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document explains in the abstract (no language bindings are provided) how an application may learn that IPsec has been applied to a conversation or specify that IPsec should be used.  Though this is useful in general it is particularly useful for applications that wish to use BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security -- a mode of IPsec keying), either in conjunction with channel binding or otherwise.</description>
