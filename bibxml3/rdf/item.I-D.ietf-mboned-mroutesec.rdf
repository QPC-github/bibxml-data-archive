    <title>"PIM-SM Multicast Routing Security Issues and Enhancements", Pekka Savola, Rami Lehtonen, Dave Meyer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mboned-mroutesec-04.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain, or inter-domain) multicast routing infrastructures. Only Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes: the traditional Any Source Multicast (ASM) model, Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) model, and the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded-RP group-to-RP mapping mechanism. This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations to mitigate the identified threats.</description>
