    <description>In some Mobile IPv4 deployments identifying the mobile node or the mobility service subscriber is not enough to distinguish between multiple services possibly provisioned to the said mobile node and its mobility service subscription.  A capability to specify different services in addition to the mobile node identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility for mobility service providers to provide multiple services within a single mobility service subscription. This document describes a Service Selection Extension for Mobile IPv4 that is intended to assist home agents to make specific service selections for the mobility service subscription during the registration procedure.</description>
