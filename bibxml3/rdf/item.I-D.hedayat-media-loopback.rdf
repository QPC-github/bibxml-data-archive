    <title>"An Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Media Loopback", Kaynam Hedayat</title>

    <description>The wide deployment of VoIP and Video over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining voice/video quality, reliability, and overall performance. In particular, media delivery is an area that needs attention. One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter. This is typically referred to as "active monitoring" of services. Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP or Video over IP service. Today in networks that deliver real-time media, short of running ' ping' and ' traceroute' to the edge, service providers are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service. The extension defined herein adds new SDP media attributes which enables establishment of media sessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for measurement of more advanced VoIP and Video Over IP performance metrics.</description>
