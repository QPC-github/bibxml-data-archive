    <title>"A Taxonomy for New Routing and Addressing Architecture Designs", Lixia  Zhang, Scott Brim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rrg-taxonomy-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Routing Research Group is tasked to design a new routing architecture to meet the challenges of scalability in face of pervasive multi-homing and inter-domain traffic engineering.  A number of solutions have been proposed.  This draft describes a taxonomy for the design space, and then uses the taxonomy to discuss and compare the proposed solutions.</description>
