    <title>"MIF Problem Requirements and Scenarios", Carl Williams, Jacni Qin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-williams-mif-problem-scenarios-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides the problem statement requirements and scenarios for MIF.  These requirements and use case scenarios are intended to define an approach to solving common problems presented in MIF.  These MIF requirements and scenarios are based around the common and prevalent problem of adaptation of a host to attach to multiple networks simultaneously.  Such a host not only has to make decisions about selection of service parameters but also how to deal with issues relating to contradictory configuration objects.  These MIF scenarios are intended to be part of a set of such scenarios that together define the purpose, scope and requirements for proposed and realized capabilities.</description>
