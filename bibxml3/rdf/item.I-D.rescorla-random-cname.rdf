    <title>"Random algorithm for RTP CNAME generation", Eric Rescorla</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rescorla-random-cname-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 6222 describes a number of mechanisms for generating a unique CNAME Unfortunately, these algorithms are rather complicated and also produce CNAMEs which in some cases are potentially linkable over multiple RTCP sessions even if a new CNAME is generated for each session.  This document specifies a replacement algorithm for the algorithm in Section 5 which does not have this limitation and is also simpler to implement.</description>
