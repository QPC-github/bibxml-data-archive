    <description>This memo describes the NEWZONE_NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which a primary master server advises a set of slave servers that there is a zone has been created and that a query should be initiated to discover the new zone data.  This draft also specifies a mechanism for the slave servers to achieve authenticated synchronization of zone data as well as zone synchronization information with the primary when a zone is created on the primary.</description>
