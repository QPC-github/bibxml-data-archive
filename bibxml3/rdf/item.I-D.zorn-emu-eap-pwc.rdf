    <title>"A Method for Changing Cleartext Passwords in the Extensible Authentication Protocol", Glen Zorn</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zorn-emu-eap-pwc-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods.  One such method is Generic Token Card (EAP-GTC) which, despite its name, is commonly used to support authentication using cleartext passwords in tunneled EAP methods. EAP-GTC does not provide the ability to change a password (for example, an expired password), however.  This document defines the PassWord Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void in functionality.</description>
