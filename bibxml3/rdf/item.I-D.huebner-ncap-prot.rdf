    <title>"The NetIQ Common Agent Protocol", Roger Huebner</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huebner-ncap-prot-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document outlines the protocol used by the NetIQ Common Agent as part of its NetIQ Common Agent Protocol (NCAP). This binary protocol is used over standard TCP sockets and provides both real-time event delivery and common RPC services to the NetIQ Common Agent Framework. These messages may be encrypted via SSL based on the handshake received during intial negotiation. Messages consist primarily of a standardized header and a variable-length body. Both message header and content are stored in sender-native form, pursuant to a reader-makes-right data flow.</description>
