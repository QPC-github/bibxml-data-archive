    <title>"PMIPv6 Localized Routing Problem Statement", Marco Liebsch, Sangjin Jeong, Wenson Wu</title>

    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is the IETF standard for network-based localized mobility management.  In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are topologically anchored at a Local Mobility Anchor, which forwards all data for registered mobile nodes.  The set up and maintenance of localized routing, which allows forwarding of data packets between mobile nodes and correspondent nodes directly without involvement of the Local Mobility Anchor in forwarding, is not considered.  This document describes the problem space of localized routing in Proxy Mobile IPv6.</description>
