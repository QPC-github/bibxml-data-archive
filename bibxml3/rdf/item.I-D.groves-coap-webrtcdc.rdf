    <description>The WebRTC framework defines a generic transport service allowing WEB-browsers and other endpoints to exchange generic data from peer to peer utilizing a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport.  This service is known as Web Real Time Communication WebRTC data channels (WebRTC DC).  The use of WebRTC DCs for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) allows WebRTC enabled devices to exchange CoAP data between peers in a secure reliable manner.</description>
