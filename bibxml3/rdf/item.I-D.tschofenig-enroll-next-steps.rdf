    <title>"Next Steps for ENROLL", Hannes Tschofenig, Dirk Kroeselberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tschofenig-enroll-next-steps-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes framework specific aspects relevant for the Credential and Provisioning (ENROLL) working group. State-of-the-art work with possible relevance for ENROLL is given with a special focus on the 3GPP Generic Authentication Architecture (GAA), which has a relationship to the Trusted Transitive Introduction (TTI) model. The main goal of this document is to initiate some discussions about the focus of the working group and possible next steps.</description>
