    <description>This Memo was sent to the IESG prior to their approval of the IDNA document set (except the "Mapping" WG consensual document) by the Chair of Projet.FRA, a French speaking netspace. It is completed by a community report sent after ICANN launched their "FAST TRACK" project.</description>
