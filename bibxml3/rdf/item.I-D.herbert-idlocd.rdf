    <title>"Identifier-locator control daemon", Tom Herbert</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-herbert-idlocd-00.txt</link>
    <description>Identifier-locator protocols rely on a mapping system that is able to map identifiers to locators. Such a mapping system is a type of key/value store. This draft proposes a design and implementation for an Identifier-Locator control daemon (idlocd). The intent is to provide an open source implementation that would be a basis for experimentation, development, and eventual deployment of identifier- locator solutions at large scale.</description>
