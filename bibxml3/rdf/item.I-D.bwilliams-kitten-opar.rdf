    <description>This document introduces the Open Password Automation Recipe (OPAR) Protocol, a suggested format for providing instructions to password managers programmatically that defines the valid construction of a password. With password managers becoming integrated into browsers, websites should be able to describe the elements of an acceptable password programmatically so password management plugins can read and automatically generate the best option. Without this, manual intervention by the user is required when the password is too long, contains invalid characters, or does not meet complexity requirements.</description>
