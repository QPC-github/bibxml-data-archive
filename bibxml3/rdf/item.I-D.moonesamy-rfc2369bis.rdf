    <title>"The Use of URIs as Meta-Syntax for Core Mail List Commands and their Transport through Message Header Fields", S Moonesamy, Grant Neufeld, Joshua Baer</title>

    <description>The mailing list command specification and identification header fields are a set of structured fields to be added to email messages sent by email distribution lists.  Command header fields typically contain URIs (usually including "mailto") locating the relevant information or performing the command directly.  The three core command header fields described in this document are List-Help, List- Subscribe, and List-Unsubscribe.  There are three other header fields described here which, although not as widely applicable, will have utility for a sufficient number of mailing lists to justify their formalization here.  These are List-Post, List-Owner and List-Archive.  By including these header fields, mailing list managers can make it possible for mail user agents to provide automated tools for users to perform list functions.</description>
