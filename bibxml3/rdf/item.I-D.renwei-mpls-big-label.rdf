    <title>"Encoding of Big Labels in MPLS Label Stacks", Renwei Li, Ming Li</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-renwei-mpls-big-label-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods for MPLS big labels.  Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks in data centers by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs.  Data center virtualization encapsulation methods and protocols such as VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3 are being standardized to support a few millions of virtual networks, but the currently label format can support up to one million of labels.  When the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method, for example, is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding virtual networks, more than one million of labels are required to map VPN labels and Virtual Network Identifiers.</description>
