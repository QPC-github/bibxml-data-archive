    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bakleh-reg-adm-acg-apu-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides guidelines for zone administrators(including but not limited to registry operators and registrars), and information for all domain names holders, on the administration of those domain names which contain characters drawn from Arabic Characters Group of Languages. Other language groups are encouraged to develop their own guidelines as needed, based on these guidelines if that is helpful. The document gives basic guidelines for IDN registrars (as it is the case for IETF Document that talks about Japanese, Chinese and Korean domain name registration "RFC 3490"). The document provides also information for owners of IDN that contains Arabic characters on name reservation process. The document does not cover Arabic gTLD or ccTLD problems. Comments on this document can be sent to the authors at arabic-idn-admin@aietf.org.</description>
