    <description>Applications such as SRv6 TE may require to collect detailed performance data on SR paths.  Existing in-situ OAM techniques incur encapsulation and header overhead issues.  This document describes a method based on Postcard-based Telemetry with Packet Marking for SRv6 on-path OAM, which avoids the extra overhead for encapsulating telemetry-related instruction and metadata in SRv6 packets.</description>
