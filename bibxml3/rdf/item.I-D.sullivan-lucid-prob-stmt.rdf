    <title>"A Problem Statement to Motivate Work on Locale-free Unicode Identifiers", Andrew Sullivan, Asmus Freytag</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sullivan-lucid-prob-stmt-00.txt</link>
    <description>Internationalization techniques that the IETF has adopted depended on some assumptions about the way characters get added to Unicode.  Some of those assumptions turn out not to have been true.  Discussion is necessary to determine how the IETF should respond to the new understanding of how Unicode works.</description>
