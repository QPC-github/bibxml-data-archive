    <description>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF has produced a complete architecture for controlling media server resources in Internet Protocol (IP) based networks.  An important function in the MediaCtrl architecture is the Media Resource Broker entity which monitors and allocates media resources to requesting applications.  This document introduces a Media Resource Broker (MRB) Location Function (MLF) which works in partnership with MRB's in large deployments providing a light weight scaling and failover mechanism.</description>
