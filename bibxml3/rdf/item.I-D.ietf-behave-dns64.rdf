    <title>"DNS64: DNS extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers", Marcelo Bagnulo, Andrew Sullivan, Philip Matthews, Iljitsch van Beijnum</title>

    <description>DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records. DNS64 is used with an IPv6/IPv4 translator to enable client-server communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server, without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node, for the class of applications that work through NATs.  This document specifies DNS64, and provides suggestions on how it should be deployed in conjunction with IPv6/IPv4 translators.</description>
