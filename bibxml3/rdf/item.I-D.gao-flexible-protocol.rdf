    <description>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides mobility, multihoming and multipath load balancing support by introducing the concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which was firstly suggested in [Gao2002].  It provides additional transport layer features such as ubiquitous message authentication with optional encryption, zero round-trip connection cloning, transmit transaction and quad-party shared secret installation facility.</description>
