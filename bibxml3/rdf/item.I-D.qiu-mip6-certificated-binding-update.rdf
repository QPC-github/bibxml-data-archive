    <description>This document proposes a comprehensive security solution for mobile IPv6 networks including secure binding update, secure fast handover, user authentication and session key management for data security. In our proposal, one of the home agent's functions is to act as security proxy for its mobile nodes. The authentication is based on the home agent's certificate and the secret session keys are generated by strong cryptosystems. Our proposal avoids many security obstacles in the Return Routability protocol and provides a simple, integrated and efficient security solution for mobile communication.</description>
