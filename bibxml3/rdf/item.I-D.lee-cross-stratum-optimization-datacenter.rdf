    <description>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as video gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used to provide application services are distributed geographically around a network, many decisions made in the control and management of application services, such as where to instantiate another service instance or to which data center out of several a new client is assigned, can have a significant impact on the state of the network. Conversely the capabilities and state of the network can have a major impact on application performance.  Currently application decisions are made with very little or no information concerning the underlying network used to deliver those services. Hence such decisions may be sub-optimal from both application and network resource utilization and quality of service objectives. This document proposes a research program into cross stratum application/network optimization focusing on the challenges and opportunities presented by data center based applications and carriers networks.</description>
