    <title>"RMD-QSP: An NSIS QoS Signaling Policy model for Networks Using Resource  Management in Diffserv (RMD)", Attila Bader</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bader-nsis-rmd-diffserv-qsm-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an NSIS QoS Signaling Policy model for networks that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept. RMD is a technique for adding admission control to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks. RMD complements the Diffserv architecture by pushing complex classification, conditioning and admission control functions to the edges of a Diffserv domain and simplifying the operation of internal nodes.</description>
