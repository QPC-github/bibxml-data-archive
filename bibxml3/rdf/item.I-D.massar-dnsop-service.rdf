    <title>"The _service domain and prefix", Jeroen Massar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-massar-dnsop-service-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new domain, _service., which can be used for automatic service configuration and discovery. The associated anycast prefixes can be used to configure a default DNS server, which provides lookups for a local _service. domain but also acts as a (caching) recursive DNS server, thus allowing DNS clients to use this well-known address as their default DNS server as well as to use it to find various well known services, thus avoiding manual configuration.</description>
