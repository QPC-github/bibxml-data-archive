    <title>"End-to-middle security in the Session Initiation Protocol(SIP)", Kinji Ono, Shinya Tachimoto</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ono-sipping-end2middle-security-04.txt</link>
    <description>Some services provided by intermediaries depend on the ability to inspect the message bodies in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). When sensitive information is included in these bodies, a SIP User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from intermediaries except those that the UA agreed to disclose it to. This document proposes a mechanism for securing information passed between an end user and intermediaries using S/MIME. It also proposes mechanisms for an intermediary to notify the UA about its need to inspect an S/MIME-secured message body, and to notify the need for the message body to be transmitted securely.</description>
