    <title>"Mobile IPv4 Fast Handovers", Rajeev Koodli, Charles Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mip4-fmipv4-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document adapts the Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers to improve delay and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv4 handover operations. Specifically, this document addresses movement detection, IP address configuration and location update latencies during a handover. For reducing the IP address configuration latency, the document proposes that the new Care-of Address is always made to be the new access router's IP address. Additional mechanisms may be defined in the future versions of this document.</description>
