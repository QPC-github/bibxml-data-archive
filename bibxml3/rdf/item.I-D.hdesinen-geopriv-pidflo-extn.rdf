    <description>The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information. The XML Schema presented in this memo extends the 'geopriv' element defined in PIDF-LO with a complex XML element called "device-loc-capabilities". A device can specify this element inside a 'geopriv' element to communicate the position determination methods and the location solutions supported by it to a location server. Knowledge of the device's location capabilities can permit a server along the path of an emergency voice over IP call to immediately initiate position determination update procedures when needed.</description>
