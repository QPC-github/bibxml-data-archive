        <description>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information. Specifically, IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data packets while they traverse the network.  This document introduces a new IOAM option type (denoted IOAM-Option-Type) called the Direct Export (DEX) Option-Type, which is used as a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported or locally aggregated without being pushed into in-flight data packets.  The exporting method and format are outside the scope of this document.</description>
