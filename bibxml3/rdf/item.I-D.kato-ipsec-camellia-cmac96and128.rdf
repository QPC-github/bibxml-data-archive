    <description>This memo specifies two new algorithms for IPsec.  One is the usage of Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with the Camellia block cipher as an authentication mechanism in the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header protocols. This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96.  The other algorithm is a pseudo-random function (PRF) based on CMAC with the Camellia block cipher for the Internet Key Exchange, version 2.  This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.</description>
