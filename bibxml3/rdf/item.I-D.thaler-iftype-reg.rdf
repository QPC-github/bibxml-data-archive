    <title>"Guidelines and Registration Procedures for Interface Types and Tunnel Types", Dave Thaler, Dan Romascanu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thaler-iftype-reg-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides guidelines and procedures for those who are defining, registering, or evaluating definitions of new interface types ("ifType" values) and tunnel types.  The original definition of the IANA interface type registry predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules, and so some confusion arose over time.  Tunnel types were added later, with the same requirements and allocation policy as interface types.  This document updates RFC 2863, and provides updated guidance for these registries.</description>
