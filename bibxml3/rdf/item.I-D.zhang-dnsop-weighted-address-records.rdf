    <description>Scheduling traffic in proportion to different nodes can optimize bandwidth utilization and improve user experience when the Internet traffic exceeds the bandwidth limit of a CDN cache node.  This document defines AX and AAAAX RR types by adding weight field to existing A and AAAA resource records.  A group of weighted records will be sorted in the DNS response according to the weight in AX and AAAAX records.</description>
