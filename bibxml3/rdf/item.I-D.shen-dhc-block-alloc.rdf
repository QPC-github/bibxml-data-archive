    <title>"DHCP Proxy Server Micro-block Allocation Scheme For IP Address Pool  Management", Naiming Shen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shen-dhc-block-alloc-03.txt</link>
    <description>A new DHCP address allocation mechanism called Micro-blocking is proposed in this document. It is used for DHCP proxy servers or routers working with DHCP servers to maximize the IP address allocation efficiency while improve dynamic routing scalability in provider's networks. A DHCP sub-option within the relay agent information option 82 is defined in this document. This simple DHCP extension can be applied as a simple IP address-pool management among multiple IP devices.</description>
