    <description>This document describes the Service Extensible Protocol (SEP), which is the peer protocol spoken between P2PSIP Overlay peers to share information and organize the P2PSIP Overlay Network.  SEP uses a flexible forwarding mechanism to avoid congestion in the Overlay.  It also proposes a general service discovery method and a built-in NATtraversal mechanism. By using these methods, SEP tries to improve the success rate and reduce the latency of the transaction.</description>
