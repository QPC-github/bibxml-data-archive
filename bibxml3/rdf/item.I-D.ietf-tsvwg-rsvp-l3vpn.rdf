    <title>"Support for RSVP in Layer 3 VPNs", Bruce Davie, Francois Le Faucheur, Ashok Narayanan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-l3vpn-07.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 4364 and RFC 4659 define an approach to building provider- provisioned Layer 3 VPNs for IPv4 and IPv6.  It may be desirable to use RSVP to perform admission control on the links between Customer Edge (CE) routers and Provider Edge (PE) routers.  This document specifies procedures by which RSVP messages travelling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may be appropriately handled by PE routers so that admission control can be performed on PE-CE links.  Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbone may also be supported.</description>
