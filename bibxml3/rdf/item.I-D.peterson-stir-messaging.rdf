        <description>Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of attesting the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in order to prevent impersonation of a calling party number, which is a key enabler for illegal robocalling.  Similar impersonation is sometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text messaging space.  This document considers the applicability of STIR's Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework to instant text and multimedia messaging use cases, both for messages carried or negotiated by SIP, and for non-SIP messaging.</description>
