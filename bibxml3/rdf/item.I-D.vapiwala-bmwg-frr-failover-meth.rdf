    <description>This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking the failover time of local protection (aka Fast Reroute). The failover to a backup tunnel could happen at the headend of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the backup could offer link or node protection. It becomes vital to benchmark the failover time for all the cases and combinations. The failover time could also greatly differ based on the design and implementation and by factors like the number of prefixes carried by the tunnel, the number of primary tunnels affected by the event that caused the failover, number of primary tunnels the backup protects and type of failure etc. All the required benchmarking criteria and benchmarking topology required for measuring failover time of local protection is described Conventions used in this document</description>
