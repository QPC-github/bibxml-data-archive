    <title>"Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures", Simon Josefsson, Sean Leonard</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-josefsson-pkix-textual-10.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes and discusses the textual encodings of the Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The textual encodings are well-known, are implemented by several applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.  This document articulates the de-facto rules by which existing implementations operate, defines them so that future implementations can interoperate.</description>
