        <title>"Compatible Version Negotiation for QUIC", David Schinazi, Eric Rescorla</title>

        <description>QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client offered is unacceptable.  This document describes a version negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version.  Optionally, if the original and negotiated version share a compatible first flight format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip.</description>
