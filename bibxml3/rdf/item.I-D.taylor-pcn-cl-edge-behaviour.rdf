    <description>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in ID.PCNArch.  This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain.  The behaviour described here is that for three-state measurement-based load control, known informally as CL.  The requirement for three encoding states means that CL is for experimental use only pending further standards action.</description>
