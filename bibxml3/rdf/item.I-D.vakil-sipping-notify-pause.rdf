    <title>"An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events for Pausing and  Resuming Notifications", Mohammad Vakil, Sriram Parameswar</title>

    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables a subscriber to receive asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.  It defines mechanisms to create, refresh, terminate subscriptions.  This framework also defines mechanism to fetch (poll) an event state of a resource without creating persistent subscriptions.  There is no mechanism to temporarily pause the notifications, while still maintaining a subscription on the server.  This lack of functionality sometime results in a lot of superfluous notification traffic, and put unnecessary load on the server.  This draft defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber to pause, un-pause notifications, and be able to perform fetch (poll) subscriptions within an established (created) subscription dialog.</description>
