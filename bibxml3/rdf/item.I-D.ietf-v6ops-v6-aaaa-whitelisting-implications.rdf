    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-v6ops-v6-aaaa-whitelisting-implications-11.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes considerations for the transition of end user content on the Internet to IPv6.  While this is tailored to address end user content, which is typically web-based, many aspects of this document may be more broadly applicable to the transition to IPv6 of other applications and services.  This document explores the challenges involved in the transition to IPv6, potential migration tactics, possible migration phases, and other considerations.  The audience for this document is the Internet community generally, particularly IPv6 implementers.</description>
