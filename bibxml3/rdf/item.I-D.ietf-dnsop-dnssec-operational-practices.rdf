    <title>"DNSSEC Operational Practices", R Gieben, Olaf Kolkman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-operational-practices-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a set of practices for operating the DNS with security extensions (DNSSEC). The target audience is zone administrators deploying DNSSEC. The document discusses operational aspects of using keys and signatures in the DNS. It discusses issues as key generation, key storage, signature generation, key rollover and related policies. This document obsoletes RFC 2541, as it covers more operational ground and gives more up to date requirements with respect to key sizes and the new DNSSEC specification.</description>
