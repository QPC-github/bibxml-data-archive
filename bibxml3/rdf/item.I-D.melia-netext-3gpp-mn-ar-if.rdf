    <description>This ID documents the interface between the Mobile Node and the Mobility Access Gateway in the context of 3GPP Evolved Packet Core networks.  The main goal is to support the Netext working group in the discussions on the MN to AR interface showing how RFC 5213 has been deployed by other SDOs.  This document has been inspired by considerations expressed in [I-D.gundavelli-netext-extensions-motivation].</description>
