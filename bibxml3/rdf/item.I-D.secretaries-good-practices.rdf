    <title>"IETF Working Groups' Secretaries", Martin Vigoureux, Daniel King, Carlos Pignataro</title>

    <description>The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in RFC 2418. However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in value and scope, since the writing of RFC 2418. This document thus provides a compilation of good practices and general guidelines regarding the fulfilment of the role.  This document is intended for established Working Group Secretaries, individuals motivated by taking up that role, or anyone else simply interested in understanding better the Working Group Secretary's role. This document may also be useful for Working Group Chairs to better appreciate and help develop the value of Working Group Secretaries.</description>
