    <title>"Protecting The Router Control Plane", Dave Dugal, Carlos Pignataro, Rodney Dunn</title>

    <description>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all legitimate router control plane traffic is identified.  Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed in the router's forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane, or rate limits such traffic to an acceptable level.</description>
