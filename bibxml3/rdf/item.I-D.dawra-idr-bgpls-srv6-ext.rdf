    <description>Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) allows for a flexible definition of end- to-end paths within various topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological or functional sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are advertised by the various protocols such as BGP, ISIS and OSPFv3.  BGP Link-state (BGP-LS) address-family solution for SRv6 is similar to BGP-LS for SR for MPLS dataplane.  This draft defines extensions to the BGP-LS to advertise SRv6 Segments along with their functions and other attributes via BGP.</description>
