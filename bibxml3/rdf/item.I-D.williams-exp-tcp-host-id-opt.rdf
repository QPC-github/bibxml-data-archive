    <title>"An Experimental TCP Option for Host Identification", Brandon Williams, Mohamed Boucadair, Dan Wing</title>

    <description>Recent RFCs have discussed issues with host identification in IP address sharing systems, such as shared address/prefix sharing devices and application-layer proxies.  Potential solutions for revealing a host identifier in shared address deployments have also been discussed.  This memo describes the design, deployment, and privacy considerations for one such solution in operational use on the Internet today that uses a TCP option to transmit a host identifier.</description>
