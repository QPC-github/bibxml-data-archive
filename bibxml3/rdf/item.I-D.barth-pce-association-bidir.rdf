    <title>"PCEP Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", Colby Barth, Rakesh Gandhi, Bin Wen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barth-pce-association-bidir-04.txt</link>
    <description>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP.  This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional LSP when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when using a Stateless PCE.</description>
