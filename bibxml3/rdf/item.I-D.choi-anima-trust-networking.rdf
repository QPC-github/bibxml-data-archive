    <description>This document describes trust networking as an application of autonomic networking. The objective of trustworthy autonomic networking is providing trust networking environment where all autonomic nodes can communicate without any security concern. It defines a trust networking domain and describes how to configure and maintain the trust networking domain. While communication within the trust networking domain is done with trust, the communication with external nodes should be done via a specific autonomic service agent (ASA) called "trust gateway". The trust gateway ASA performs trust evaluation of the external nodes and enforces domain specific policies to keep the domain trustworthy.</description>
