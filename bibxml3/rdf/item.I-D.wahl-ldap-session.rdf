    <title>"LDAP Session Tracking Control", Mark Wahl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wahl-ldap-session-03.txt</link>
    <description>Many network devices, application servers, and middleware components of a enterprise software infrastructure generate some form of session tracking identifiers, which are useful when analyzing activity and accounting logs to group activity relating to a particular session. This document discusses how Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAP) clients can include session tracking identifiers with their LDAP requests. This information is provided through controls in the requests the clients send to LDAP servers. The LDAP server receiving these controls can include the session tracking identifiers in the log messages it writes, enabling LDAP requests in the LDAP server's logs to be correlated with activity in logs of other components in the infrastructure. The control also enables session tracking information to be generated by LDAP servers and returned to clients and other servers. Three formats of session tracking identifiers are defined in this document.</description>
