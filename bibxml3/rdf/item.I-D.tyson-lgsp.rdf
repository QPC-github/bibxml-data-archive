    <description>This document presents the Lightweight GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Support Protocol (LGSP).  The Lightweight GNSS Support Protocol (LGSP) is being developed in order to provide a comprehensive solution which solves the problems inherent in traditional radio-based Differential GPS (DGPS) protocols.  LGSP will also provide additional support for GNSS user equipment, such as a GPS almanac retrieval method, allowing compatible units to perform faster almanac acquisition, thus resulting in less time until an initial position measurement can be established.  Other supporting features include alternative distribution of GPS navigation messages and differential correction messages, a hierarchical mirroring architecture, redundant backup operation and load balancing functions.</description>
