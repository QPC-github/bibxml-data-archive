    <title>"Revealing hosts sharing an IP address using TCP option", Andrew Yourtchenko, Dan Wing</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wing-nat-reveal-option-03.txt</link>
    <description>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios.  This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP clients sharing an IP address.  The proposed method uses a TCP option, which avoids altering the application-level payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.</description>
