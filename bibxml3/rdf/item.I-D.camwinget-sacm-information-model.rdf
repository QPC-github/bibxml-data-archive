    <description>***replaces abstract in WG IM*** This document defines the information model for Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM).  This includes the definition of information elements transported between SACM components (data in motion) and how to express their relationships.  This information model is maintained as the IANA "SACM Information Elements" registry.  The information model captures the information needs described in the use cases defined by SACM.</description>
