    <title>"Applying Unauthenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) to Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) Connections", Matthew Miller</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-miller-http-unauth-tls-00.txt</link>
    <description>With the pervasiveness of passive monitoring and ubiquity of unencrypted Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), it is desirable to mitigate passive monitoring without causing an undue burden on HTTP user agents and servers.  This document describes the rationale and process for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) in an unauthenticated manner for exchanging HTTP messages.  The application of unauthenticated TLS - particularly when Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) algorithms are used - change monitoring from being a passive attack into an active attack.</description>
