    <description>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link technology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. Since the TRILL base protocol was approved in March 2010, active development of TRILL has revealed errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases that could use clarifications or updates.  RFC 6327 and RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect to Adjacency and Appointed Forwarders. This document provides other known clarifications, corrections, and updates to RFC 6325, RFC 6327, and RFC 6439.</description>
