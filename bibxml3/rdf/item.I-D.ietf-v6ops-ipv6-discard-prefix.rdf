    <title>"A Discard Prefix for IPv6", Nick Hilliard, David Freedman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-discard-prefix-05.txt</link>
    <description>Remote triggered black hole filtering describes a method of mitigating the effects of denial-of-service attacks by selectively discarding traffic based on source or destination address.  Remote triggered black hole routing describes a method of selectively re- routing traffic into a sinkhole router (for further analysis) based on destination address.  This document updates the IPv6 Special Purpose Address Registry by explaining why a unique IPv6 prefix should be formally assigned by IANA for the purpose of facilitating IPv6 remote triggered black hole filtering and routing.</description>
