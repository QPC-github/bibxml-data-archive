    <title>"Multiple Attachments for EDI-INT", Kyle Meadors</title>

    <description>The EDI-INT AS1, AS2 and AS3 messages were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents.  Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message.  As adoption of EDI-INT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport. Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message.  This informational draft describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDI-INT transport message.  The attachments are stored within the MIME Multipart/Related structure. A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.</description>
