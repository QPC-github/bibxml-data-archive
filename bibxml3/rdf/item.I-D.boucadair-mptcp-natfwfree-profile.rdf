    <description>One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP) is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected to multiple networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of such resources, thereby providing better serviceability overall (including whenever the CPE fails to connect to one of the access networks).  This document specifies a MPTCP profile for such deployments in network regions that are firewall- and NAT-free.</description>
