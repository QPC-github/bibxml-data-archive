        <description>The IETF Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Working Group Chairs and Routing Area Director chartered a design team to take forward the encapsulation discussion and see if there was potential to design a common encapsulation that addresses the various technical concerns.  There are implications of having different encapsulations in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations and within and spanning multiple data centers.  For example, OAM functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations along the data path.  The design team recommended Geneve with a few modifications as the common encapsulation. This document provides more details, particularly in Section 7.</description>
