    <title>"Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in Session Description Protocol", Ali Begen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc4756bis-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the semantics for grouping the associated source and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 3388bis).  These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or repair flow are associated in the same group, and they provide support for additive repair flows.  Synchronization Source (SSRC)-level grouping semantics are also defined in this document for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.</description>
