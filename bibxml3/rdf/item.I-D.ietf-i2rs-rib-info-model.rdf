    <description>Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a routing information base (RIB).  Protocols and configuration push data into the RIB and the RIB manager installs state into the hardware for packet forwarding.  This draft specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data model, and it was used by the IETF's I2RS WG to design the I2RS RIB data model. It is being published to record the higher-level informational model decisions for RIBs so that other developers of RIBs may benefit from the design concepts.</description>
