    <title>"Stream Control Transmission Protocol(SCTP) Cumulative ASCONF chunk  transmission extension", Shin Maruyama, Masahiro Kozuka</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-marushin-sctp-asconfext-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extensions to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol(SCTP) [RFC2960] and the "Dynamic Address Reconfiguration" [draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp]. In this proposal, we propose changes to the way ASCONF's are handled and bundled to allow multiple ASCONF's to be sent during times of disconnected connectivity. This then allows a method which allows the retransmit of multiple ASCONF chunk within a single packet to better support reliable handover.</description>
