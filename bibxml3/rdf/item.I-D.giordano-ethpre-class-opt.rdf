    <description>Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, is a family of frame-based networking technologies for local area networks. It's the most widespread wired LAN technology. This document proposes a variation of the original frame's structure to perform a frame's classification and a switching optimization (fundamental steps for QoS mechanism).</description>
