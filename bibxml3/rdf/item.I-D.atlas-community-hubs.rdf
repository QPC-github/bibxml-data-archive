    <description>IETF Community Hubs are geographically-focused groups that facilitate participation in IETF activities.  An IETF Community Hub may have different focuses, depending upon the interests of those participating, such as cross-area learning, outreach, mentoring, problem refinement, implementation and interop testing, and social. An IETF Community Hub's focuses and the energy of its coordinators will determine what types of activities are organized.  Sample activities may include sessions of technical talks, social get- togethers, remote hubs during some IETF WG meetings, hackathons, etc.</description>
