    <title>"A method for storing IPsec keying material in DNS", Michael Richardson</title>

    <description>This document describes a new resource record for Domain Name System (DNS). This record may be used to store public keys for use in IP security (IPsec) systems. The record also includes provisions for indicating what system should be contacted when establishing an IPsec tunnel with the entity in question. This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type #1 of the KEY Resource Record, which has been obsoleted by RFC3445.</description>
