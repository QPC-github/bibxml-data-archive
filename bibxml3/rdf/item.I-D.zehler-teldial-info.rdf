    <title>"Dial String syntax for the "tel" URI Scheme", Peter Zehler</title>

    <description>The "tel" URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for Telephone Numbers [RFC3966] describes resources identified by telephone numbers.  These resources specify termination points within a public or private telephone network. The termination points are a globally or locally unique endpoint.  RFC3966 does not address the means by which the telephone URI can be used to reach termination point from a specific node in the telephone network.  This document specifies the means by which the termination point is reached from a specific node in the telephone network. This document specifies how to encode the numbers, symbols and pauses required to traverse the phone network to reach the termination point in an RFC 3966 compliant "tel" URI.</description>
