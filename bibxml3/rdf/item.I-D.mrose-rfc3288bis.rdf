    <description>This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol core (BEEP). A SOAP binding describes how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network. The SOAP is an XML-based (extensible markup language) messaging protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed messaging models. It defines a message format and describes a variety of message patterns, including, but not limited to, RPC, asynchronous event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP intermediaries.</description>
