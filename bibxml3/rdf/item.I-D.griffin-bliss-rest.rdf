    <title>"Representational State Transfer (REST) for Feature Configuration in Session  Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Keith Griffin, Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-griffin-bliss-rest-00.txt</link>
    <description>In order to provide interoperable implementations of certain Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based features, such as automated call handling, it is necessary for devices to configure network servers with feature data.  An example is a call forwarding number for a call forwarding service.  This document introduces the concept of Representational State Transfer (REST) and gives an example of how REST can be used for such configuration.</description>
