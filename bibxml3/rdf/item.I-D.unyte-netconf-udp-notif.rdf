    <description>This document describes an UDP-based notification mechanism to collect data from networking devices.  A shim header is proposed to facilitate the streaming of data directly from line cards to a collector.  The objective is to rely on a lightweight approach to allow for higher frequency and better transit performance compared to already established notification mechanisms.</description>
