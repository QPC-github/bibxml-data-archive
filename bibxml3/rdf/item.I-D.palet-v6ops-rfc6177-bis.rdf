    <title>"IPv6 Address Assignment to End-Sites", Jordi Palet, Rosalea Roberts</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-palet-v6ops-rfc6177-bis-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies have different views regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end- sites.  However, all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is a decision of each operator.  This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy and guidelines belong to the RIR community.  This revision is being made to emphasize that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever-increasing availability of subnets at the end-site, so policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is never recommended.  This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment to End Sites).</description>
