    <description>The memo has been proposed to extend happy eyeballs algorithm to fit into multiple interfaces environment.  Based on this extended heuristic algorithm, a client with multiple interface could determine the optimal flow path in which specific interface has been chosen. Furthermore, an appropriate IP address family for each interface can be also identified to guarantee user experiences during IPv6 transition period.</description>
