    <description>This document proposes an algorithm for a node to compute a flooding topology, which is a subgraph of the complete topology per underline physical network.  When every node in an area automatically calculates a flooding topology by using a same algorithm and floods the link states using the flooding topology, the amount of flooding traffic in the network is greatly reduced.  This would reduce convergence time with a more stable and optimized routing environment.</description>
