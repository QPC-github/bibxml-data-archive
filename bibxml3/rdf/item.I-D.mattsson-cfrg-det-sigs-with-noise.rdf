        <description>Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their security do not depend on a source of high-quality randomness. Recent research has however found that implementations of these signature algorithms may be vulnerable to certain side-channel and fault injection attacks due to their determinism.  One countermeasure to such attacks is to re-add randomness to the otherwise deterministic calculation of the per-message secret number.  This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC 8032 to recommend constructions with additional randomness for deployments where side-channel attacks and fault injection attacks are a concern.  The updates are invisible to the validator of the signature and compatible with existing ECDSA and EdDSA validators.</description>
