    <title>"Broadcast With Network Coding: DRAGONCAST", Cedric Adjih, Songyean Cho, Emmanuel Baccelli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-adjih-dragoncast-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast protocol suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANET).  It provides data dissemination from a single source, based on intra-flow network coding and for Internet Protocol (IP).  It is designed to minimize the assumptions over the working environment and thus may operates over dynamically evolving environments.</description>
