    <description>Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes of such a link.  In constrained networks, a collection of Web links can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690).  This specification defines a common format for representing Web links in CBOR format (RFC7049).  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</description>
