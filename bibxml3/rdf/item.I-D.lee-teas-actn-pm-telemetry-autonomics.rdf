    <description>This document provides YANG data models that describe performance monitoring telemetry and scaling intent mechanism for TE-tunnels and Virtual Networks (VN).  The models presented in this draft allow customers to subscribe to and monitor their key performance data of their interest on the level of TE-tunnel or VN. The models also provide customers with the ability to program autonomic scaling intent mechanism on the level of TE-tunnel as well as VN.</description>
