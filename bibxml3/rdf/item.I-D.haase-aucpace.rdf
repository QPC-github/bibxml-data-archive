        <description>This document describes AuCPace which is an augmented PAKE protocol for two parties.  The protocol was tailored for constrained devices and smooth migration for compatibility with legacy user credential databases.  It is designed to be compatible with any group of both prime- and non-prime order and comes with a security proof providing composability guarantees.</description>
