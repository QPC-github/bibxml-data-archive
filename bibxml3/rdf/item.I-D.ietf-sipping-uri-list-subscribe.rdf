    <title>"Subscriptions to Request-Contained Resource Lists in the Session Initiation  Protocol (SIP)", Gonzalo Camarillo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-uri-list-subscribe-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a way to create subscription to a list of resources in SIP. This is achieved by including the list of resources in the body of a SUBSCRIBE. Instead of having a subscriber send a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber defines the resource list, subscribes to it, and gets notifications about changes in the resources' state using a single SUBSCRIBE dialog.</description>
