    <description>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to viechle probe mechanism currently being prototyped.  The main purpose of disclosing this -00 document is to introduce the application idea and start discussion within the DTNRG.  Because of this, the current mechanism described in this docment does not conform to the protocols defined in the DTNRG at this moment.  The mechanism should be updated based on the discussion in this group.)  This document describes the application message format used for the decentralized probe system for vehicles.  The probe system exchanges the application messages between vehicles using the transport protocol defined in the separate specification.</description>
