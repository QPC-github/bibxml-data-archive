    <title>"An ID/Locator Architecture for P2PSIP", Eric Cooper, Alan Johnston, Philip  Matthews</title>

    <description>This document describes an architecture where peers in an peer-to- peer overlay use special IP addresses to identify other peers.  Two of the advantages of this approach are that (a) most existing applications can run in an overlay without needing any changes and (b) peer mobility and NAT traversal are handled in a way that is transparent to most applications.</description>
