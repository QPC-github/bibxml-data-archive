    <title>"Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Miguel Garcia, Simo Veikkolainen, Robert Gilman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-garcia-mmusic-sdp-misc-cap-01.txt</link>
    <description>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a Media capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.  This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate a number of miscellaneous SDP capabilities. In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media titles ("i=" line for each media), connection data ("c=" line), and media bandwidth ("b=" line).</description>
