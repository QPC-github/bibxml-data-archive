    <description>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives information to support admission control and flow termination in order to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows.  [I-D.taylor-cl-edge- behaviour] describes one boundary node behaviours for three-state measurement-based load control, known informally as CL [I-D.briscoe- tsvwg-cl-phb].  In [I-D.taylor-cl-edge-behaviour], flow termination is required if excess-traffic-marked packets were observed and the end of one measurement period MUST be the beginning of the next one, independently of current flow conditions.  According to this termination, PCN-flows in some ingress-egress (IE) pairs may be terminated during measurement period of other IE pairs unless round- trip times (RTT) of all the IE pairs are the same.  We illustrate that this can lead to over-termination.  Our simulation confirms that accuracy of termination is improved when no PCN-flows in some IE pairs are terminated during measurement period of other IE pairs.</description>
