    <title>"Extension of the MLD proxy functionality to support multiple upstream interfaces", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Juan Zuniga</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-contreras-multimob-multiple-upstreams-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents different scenarios of applicability for an MLD proxy running more than one upstream interface. Since those scenarios impose different requirements on the MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces, it is important to ensure that the proxy functionality addresses all of them for compatibility.  The purpose of this document is to define the requirements in an MLD proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability scenarios, and to specify the proxy functionality to satisfy all of them.</description>
