    <description>This document outlines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol for Clos and fat-tree network topologies.  The protocol (1) deals with automatic construction of fat-tree topologies based on detection of links, (2) minimizes the amount of routing state held at each level, (3) automatically prunes the topology distribution exchanges to a sufficient subset of links, (4) supports automatic disaggregation of prefixes on link and node failures to prevent black-holing and suboptimal routing, (5) allows traffic steering and re-routing policies, (6) allows non-ECMP forwarding, (7) automatically re- balances traffic towards the spines based on bandwidth available and ultimately (8) provides mechanisms to synchronize a limited key-value data-store that can be used after protocol convergence to e.g. bootstrap higher levels of functionality on nodes.</description>
