    <description>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for key management implementations including asymmetric keys, symmetric keys, trust anchors, and cryptographic-related firmware.  This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP 800-59).  It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that process high-value information.  It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</description>
