    <description>Several documents on BFD based OAM for MPLS-TP has been put forward and the dependencies between those drafts are not yet fully sorted out; this document is one of these drafts. It is published in now to make ideas, motivations and approaches available. However we expect the final BFD based solution for MPLS-TP will be a cooperation of the parties between the existing drafts and that the BFD based OAM solution for MPLS-TP will merge into an agreed set of drafts approved by the MEAD team.  This document specifies the BFD extension and behaviour to meet the requirements for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification functionality and the RDI functionality as defined in [3].</description>
