    <description>This draft proposes Optimized Route Cache Protocol (ORC) to provide route optimization for the NEMO Basic Support protocol. ORC provides a dynamic route optimization mechanism, similar to route optimization in Mobile IPv6. The ORC aims to manage binding information as if routing information of each mobile network are located at special routers called 'Correspondent Router'.</description>
