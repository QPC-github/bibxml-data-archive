    <title>"Definition of Master Key between PANA Client and Enforcement Point", Yoshihiro Ohba, Alper Yegin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ohba-pana-pemk-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a master key used between a client of the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an enforcement point, for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering.  The master key is derived from the Master Session Key of Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful PANA authentication.  The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address families.</description>
