    <title>"Glossary of some Ivip and scalable routing terms", Robin Whittle</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-whittle-ivip-glossary-01.txt</link>
    <description>This glossary is intended to help with the understanding of terms used in the Ivip core-edge separation architecture and of some non- Ivip terms which are pertinent to scalable routing.  These are not "official" definitions of terms as used in scalable routing, but I hope they will help newcomers to the field.  Please suggest corrections, additions and improvements.</description>
