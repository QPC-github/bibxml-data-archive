        <description>Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing. It has been designed from scratch to work at both low and high bandwidth networks - even with high packet loss.  The objective was to keep routing overhead low and ensure a deterministic protocol exchange behavior.  DMPR can be used to manage larger networks with characteristics based on BGPv4 with transport and self-configuration properties taken from OSPF/OLSR.  Unlike BGPv4 or OSPF, DMPR does not support higher network separation concepts.  A DMPR network is a flat network in which DMPR nodes have equal tasks.  This also applies to DMPR communication.  Unlike OLSR/OSPF there is no flooding messages (topology broadcast), information are stored, accumulated/compressed and forwarded at each DMPR node.  This feature contributes to the message load being deterministic.</description>
