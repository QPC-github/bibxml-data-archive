    <description>The joint scheduling between industrial field network and backhaul network is important to satisfy the requirements of deterministic delay for data flows in factories. This document describes a joint scheduling architecture for deterministic industrial field/backhaul networks. Taking WIA-PA, an international standard about industrial wireless field network, and IPv6-based backhaul network as an example, this document depicts how the joint scheduling architecture works in detail.</description>
