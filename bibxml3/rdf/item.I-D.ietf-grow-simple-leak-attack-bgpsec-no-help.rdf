    <title>"Route-Leaks &amp; MITM Attacks Against BGPSEC", Danny McPherson, Shane Amante, Eric Osterweil, Dave Mitchell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-grow-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Global Routing Operations Working group (GROW) during routing security requirements discussions and subsequent specification.</description>
