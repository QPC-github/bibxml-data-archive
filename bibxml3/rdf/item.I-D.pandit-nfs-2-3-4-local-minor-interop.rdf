    <description>NFS (Network File System) version 4 is a major rewrite of NFS. NFS version 4 has lot of new features added into the protocol and the behavior is changed a lot from the predecessors. This Draft considers the interoperability problems of all versions of NFS and local filesystem. Yet, access to any one file system through the NFS v2 or NFS v3 or NFS v4 protocol requires that a single server be accessed. This draft tries to suggest the behavior that could be expected when NFS version 4 is used in multi-protocol environment with NFS version 2 and version 3.</description>
