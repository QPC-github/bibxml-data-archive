    <title>"Requirements for a Protocol to Replace AppleTalk NBP", Stuart Cheshire, Marc Krochmal</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nbp-10.txt</link>
    <description>One of the goals of the authors of Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) was the desire to retire AppleTalk and the AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol, and to replace them with an IP-based solution. This document presents a brief overview of the capabilities of AppleTalk NBP, and outlines the properties required of an IP-based replacement. The views expressed in this Informational document represent the opinions of the authors, not IETF consensus.</description>
