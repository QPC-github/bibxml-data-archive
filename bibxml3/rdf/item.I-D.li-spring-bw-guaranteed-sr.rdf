    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-spring-bw-guaranteed-sr-00.txt</link>
    <description>The document proposes the bandwidth-guaranteed segment for the segment routing which can be used to provide the bandwidth-guaranteed segment routing path to satisfy the QoS requirement of the service. Accordingly the forwarding mechanisms and the procedures of the control plane are explained for the bandwidth-guaranteed segment.</description>
