    <title>"AFS Byte-Range Locking", Matthew Benjamin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking-06.txt</link>
    <description>The AFS-3 protocol supports file locks, but only on whole files, only in advisory mode. Efficient support for byte-range file locking, together with the stronger semantics with which they are associated, are required to improve the suitability of AFS as a LAN file-sharing protocol for both Unix and Windows clients. Applications on the Windows platform, in particular (e.g., Microsoft Office), actually require byte-range locking to function correctly. Emulation in the client has alleviated most serious problems, albeit, with reduced semantics. We propose protocol enhancements facilitating server-coordinated byte-range locks, atomic lock up/down-grade support, improved semantics for files under byte-range lock control, protocol support for wait-on-lock with fairness, and mandatory lock enforcement for clients on request. The delegation proposal, included within this document in previous drafts, has been split out into a separate proposal, based on feedback from reviewers.</description>
