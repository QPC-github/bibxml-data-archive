    <title>"A Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)", Kaynam Hedayat</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hedayat-two-way-active-measurement-protocol-01.txt</link>
    <description>The IPPM One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] provides a common protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network devices. OWAMP [OWAMP] can be used in both directions independently to measure one-way metrics in both directions between two network elements. However, it does not accommodate round-trip or two-way measurements. This draft proposes a Two-way Active Measurement Protocol, based on the One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP], that will accommodate two-way or round-trip measurements.</description>
