    <title>"ICE Updated Offer Problematic", John Elwell, Andrew Hutton, Thomas Stach</title>

    <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) requires an updated offer-answer cycle under some circumstances, to satisfy the needs of some devices on the signalling path.  When used with SIP, this additional offer-answer cycle interacts with other things, such as fax and third party call control (3PCC).  This document describes the problems and discusses possible remedies.  This work is being discussed on the mmusic@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
