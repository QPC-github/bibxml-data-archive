    <description>This document specifies E-VPN extensions to support the new VLAN aware bundling service interface type defined in [EVPN-REQ]. The new service interface type provides advantages in reducing provisioning overhead as well as E-VPN instances scale in environments where a large number of VLANs need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network, while maintaining traffic segregation among those VLANs. The VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over a single WAN E-VPN instance used to interconnect those Data Center sites.</description>
