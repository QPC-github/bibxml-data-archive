    <description>When IP multicast trees created by PIM-SM in Any Source Multicast (ASM) mode need to pass through an MPLS domain, it may be desirable to map such trees to Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths. This document describes how to accomplish this in the case where such Point-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths are established using mLDP.</description>
