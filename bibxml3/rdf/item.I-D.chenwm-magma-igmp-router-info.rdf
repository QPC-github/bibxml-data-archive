    <title>"Extend IGMPv3 To Support Router Annoucing Information For Host", Chen Wumao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chenwm-magma-igmp-router-info-00.txt</link>
    <description>IGMP is used by IPv4 system to report their multicast group memberships to multicast routers. This document adds support for router annoucing information, that is, the ability for a multicast router to annouce information about a group to host. For example, some hosts may send reports to join a group that do not exist, so the router would send some message to inform the hosts.</description>
