    <title>"The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET-Location header", Julian Reschke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-reschke-http-get-location-01.txt</link>
    <description>Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methods other than GET to expose information.  This has the drawback that this kind of information is harder to identify (missing a URL to which a GET request could be applied) and to cache.  This document specifies a simple extension header through which a server can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP client subsequently can use with the GET method.</description>
