    <description>The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an energy management framework for networked devices.  This document presents the applicability of the EMAN information model in a variety of scenarios with cases and target devices. These use cases are useful for identifying requirements for the framework and MIBs.  Further, we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant other energy monitoring standards and architectures.</description>
