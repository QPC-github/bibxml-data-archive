    <title>"A Packet Distribution Scheme for Bandwidth Aggregation on Network Mobility", Pyung-Soo Kim, Youn-Hee Han</title>

    <description>This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth aggregation on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced mobile router (MMR). In the proposed scheme, the MMR with multiple heterogeneous wireless network interfaces effectively and fairly distributes packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple network interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a distribution counter associated with corresponding end-to-end path. This distribution counter varied by both weighted capacity and distributed packets is used to determine if a network interface has enough credits to distribute incoming packets on multiple paths. The capacity unit is shown to be a useful design parameter to make the performance of the proposed scheme as good as possible.</description>
