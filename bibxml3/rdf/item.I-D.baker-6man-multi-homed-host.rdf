    <title>"Host routing in a multi-prefix network", Fred Baker, Brian Carpenter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baker-6man-multi-homed-host-03.txt</link>
    <description>This note describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a network that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that implements BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  This host behavior may interact with source address selection in a given implementation, but logically follows it.  Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC 4861.</description>
