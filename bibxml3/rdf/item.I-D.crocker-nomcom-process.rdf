    <description>Every year the IETF's Nominating Committee (Nomcom) reviews and selects half of the IETF's leadership on the IESG, IAB and IAOC/ Trust.  In the 18 years since the inception of the Nomcom process, the Internet industry and the IETF have gone through many changes in funding, participation and focus, but not in the basic formation, structure or operation of Nomcom.  This paper explores challenges that have emerged in the conduct of Nomcom activities, particularly due to changing IETF demographics.  The paper reviews the nature, causes and consequences of these challenges, and proposes a number of specific changes.  The changes provide better communication of Nomcom institutional memory, enhance Nomcom membership expertise, and produce stronger confidentiality and etiquette practices among Nomcom participants.  Some changes require formal modification to Nomcom rules; others can be adopted immediately.</description>
