    <title>"Multihoming support for Residential Gateway (RG) using IP mobility protocols", Pierrick Seite</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-seite-dmm-bonding-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Quality of Experience of fixed network user can be improved with multiple WAN interfaces Residential Gateway (RG), i.e.  RG supporting more than one WAN interface (e.g.  LTE and DSL), so that it can take benefit of multihoming advantages.  This document discusses the use of IP mobility protocols (NEMO [RFC3753] and Mobile IPv6 [RFC6275]), and their Multiple care-of-address extension [RFC5648], to meet multihomed RG requirements.  This document also defines a new mobility option, the bonding option, for IP mobility protocols.  This option is used by the mobility entities to configure the interface bonding where packets, of a given IP flow, are distributed.</description>
