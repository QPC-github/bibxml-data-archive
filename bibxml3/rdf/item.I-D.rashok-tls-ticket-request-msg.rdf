    <description>TLS session ticket provides a stateless mechanism for server to resume connection with client.  As per TLS 1.3 [RFC8446], server always sends arbitary number of session ticket after handshake.  This document introduces a new message which is TicketRequest message, it can be send by client after handshake at any point of connection lifetime to retrieve new session ticket.  The proposed mechanism in this document is only for TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3 and future versions.</description>
