    <title>"Extensions to Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) for handling the Link Bandwidth Utilization", Wenson Wu, Dhruv Dhody, Stefano Previdi</title>

    <description>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  The Link bandwidth utilization (the total bandwidth of a link in current use for the forwarding) is an important factor to consider during path computation.  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] define mechanisms that distribute this information via OSPF and ISIS respectively.  This document describes extensions to PCEP to use them as new constraints during path computation.</description>
