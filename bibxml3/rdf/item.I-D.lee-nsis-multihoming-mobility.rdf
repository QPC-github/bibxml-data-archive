    <description>A host that is an initiator or responder of NSIS signaling messages can be not only mobile but also multihomed. Multihomed hosts and scenarios may be common in the future IPv6-based Internet. Benefits of multihoming include increased bandwidth, load balancing, load sharing, ubiquitous access, bi-casting, resilience, and etc. NSIS signaling should be able to support various multihoming scenarios. This draft describes NSIS operations and applicability in multihomed environments.</description>
