    <title>"Encrypted Key Transport for Secure RTP", John Mattsson, David McGrew, Dan Wing, Cullen Jennings</title>

    <description>IMPORTANT: This draft is just a cut down version of draft-ietf- avtcore-srtp-ekt-03 to help discussion about the key parts of EKT for the PERC WG.  Any changes decided here would need to be synchronized with the draft-ietf-avtcore-srtp-ekt draft.  Nearly all the text here came from draft-ietf-avtcore-srtp-ekt and the authors of that draft.  Encrypted Key Transport (EKT) is an extension to Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) that provides for the secure transport of SRTP master keys, Rollover Counters, and other information within SRTP.  This facility enables SRTP to work for decentralized conferences with minimal control by allowing a common key to be used across multiple endpoints.</description>
