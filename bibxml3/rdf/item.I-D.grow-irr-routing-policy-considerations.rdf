    <description>The purpose of this document is to catalog past issues influencing the efficacy of Internet Routing Registries (IRR) for inter-domain routing policy specification and application in the global routing system over the past two decades.  Additionally, it provides a discussion regarding which of these issues are still problematic in practice, and which are simply artifacts that are no longer applicable but continue to stifle inter-provider policy-based filtering adoption and IRR utility to this day.</description>
