        <description>This document recommends ways to reduce forged-origin hijack attack surface by prudently limiting the set of IP prefixes that are included in a Route Origin Authorization (ROA).  One recommendation is to avoid using the maxLength attribute in ROAs except in some specific cases.  The recommendations complement and extend those in RFC 7115.  The document also discusses creation of ROAs for facilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services.  Considerations related to ROAs and origin validation in the context of destination-based Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering are also highlighted.</description>
