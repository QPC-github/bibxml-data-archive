    <description>This document introduces a mechanism for managing peer groups in structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks.  Group management enables efficient and secure interaction between the group members (peers), by controlling the scope of propagation for the group- specific P2P messaging and other communications.  The mechanism for group management, introduced in this document, is based on a multiple-overlay scheme.  Each group is a separate overlay network with its own address space, resources, and message routing information.  A common overlay is used for sharing information about the group overlays (sub-overlays).</description>
