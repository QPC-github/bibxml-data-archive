    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in multi-domain Multi- Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  In this context, the ability to compute Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in MPLS and GMPLS networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement. This document specifies the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) procedures and potential extensions for the use of Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in PCE based MPLS-TE packet networks and GMPLS packet and non-packet networks to support a flexible establishment and maintenance of Label Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries or cross layers.</description>
