    <title>"The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-sctp-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities. SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.</description>
