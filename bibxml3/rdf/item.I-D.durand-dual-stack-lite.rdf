    <title>"Dual-stack lite broadband deployments post IPv4 exhaustion", Alain Durand</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-durand-dual-stack-lite-00.txt</link>
    <description>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been that the transition to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that most things would be converted this way before we ran out of IPv4.  It has not happened.  The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses will be depleted soon, way before any significant IPv6 deployment will have occurred.  This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the dual- stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the cost and the benefits of deploying IPv6.  It will provide the necessary bridge between the two protocols, offering an evolution path of the Internet post IANA IPv4 depletion.</description>
