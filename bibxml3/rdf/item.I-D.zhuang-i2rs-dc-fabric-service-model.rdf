    <title>"YANG Data Model for Fabric Service delivery in Data Center Network", Zhuangyan, Danian Shi, Rong Gu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhuang-i2rs-dc-fabric-service-model-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver fabric service for users within a data center network.  This model is intended to be instantiated by management system.  It provides an abstraction of services for a fabric network to be used by users. However it is not a configuration model used directly onto network infrastructures.  It should be used combining with such as fabric topology data model defined in [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] with specific fabric topology information to generate required configuration onto the related network elements to deliver the service.</description>
