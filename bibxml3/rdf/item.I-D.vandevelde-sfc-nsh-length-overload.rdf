    <description>The specification of the NSH MD Type 1 header [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh] mandates four Context Headers, 4-byte each, and they MUST be added immediately following the Service Path Header.  As direct consequence, an NSH MD Type 1 header is always Length 0x6 (six 4-byte words).  As a result, the Length field of the NSH MD Type 1 header provides an information which is known by simply looking at the "MD Type" field.  However, while [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh] does not specify the encoding of these Context Headers, other specifications have started to do so.  A need to distinguish types of Context Headers therefore arises.  This draft proposes to overload the Length field of an NSH MD Type 1 as Meta-Data context allocation identifier and to create a IANA repository for NSH MD Type 1 allocation schemes.  The NSH MD Type 1 Length field overload intends to allow universal understanding at any network location and by any network device of the context allocation structure.</description>
