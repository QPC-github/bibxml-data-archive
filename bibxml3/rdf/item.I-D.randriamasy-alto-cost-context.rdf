    <description>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where the cost maps allow only one JSON value for a requested metric.  This document introduces several protocol extensions to allow ALTO clients to support use cases such as context based connection selection in cellular networks and calendaring for unattended data. This document refers to other extension proposals posted in the ALTO WG that can support the present use cases as well.  Likewise, some of the proposed extensions may serve other ALTO use cases.</description>
