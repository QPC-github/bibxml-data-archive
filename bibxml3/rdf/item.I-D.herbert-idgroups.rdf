    <description>This draft describes a means to create logical identifier groups to manage identifiers in a mapping system for identifier-locator protocols. An identifier group consists of identifiers that have similar properties in the context of the mapping system. Identifier groups facilitate bulk operations on the mapping system that would affect multiple identifiers. A primary use case for this is to facilitate mobility of devices that are associated with possibly thousands or even millions of identifiers.</description>
