    <description>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension point.  The present document defines a number of control operators that did not make it into RFC 8610: ".cat"/".plus" for the construction of constants, ".abnf"/".abnfb" for including ABNF (RFC 5234/RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications, and ".feature" for indicating the use of a non- basic feature in an instance.</description>
