    <description>This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that captures information pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the flow takes through the network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation  aware and captures the information about constituent members through which the traffic flow passes. TraceFlow gathers information that is relevant to the flow such as interface address, interface statistics, effect of network policies on the flow and so on.</description>
