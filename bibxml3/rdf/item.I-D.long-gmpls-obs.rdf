    <title>"Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) architecture's extensions for Optical Burst Switch  network", Keping Long</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-long-gmpls-obs-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Generalized MPLS[RFC 3031] suite of protocols has been defined to control different switching technologies, such as TDM, Optical Circuit Switching, and even Optical Fibre Switching. However, Optical Burst Switching(OBS)[Qiao] is a promising optical switching technology, which is expected to be deployed in optical network in the very near future. Therefore, this document focuses mainly on how to extend the architecture of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)[RFC 3945] to support Optical Burst Switching. Herein, the extensions consist in the following issues, i.e., signaling, routing and link management. What more, the extended GMPLS architecture will be much more scalable than before. Note that the extensions are not limited a certain OBS signaling type, such as Just-In-Time or Just-Enough-Time, Wavelength- Routed OBS or traditional OBS.</description>
