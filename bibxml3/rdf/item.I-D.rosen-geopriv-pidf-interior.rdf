    <description>RFC5139 defines explicit tags for interior building location such as "BLD" (building), "UNIT", "ROOM".  There is wide variation in how interior spaces are named, and the rigid element names provided do not allow accurate representation of interior spaces that don't use the element tags defined.  This memo provides an alternative mechanism that provides an extensible flexible way to name spaces in any kind of addressable location.</description>
