    <title>"IS-IS Routing with Reverse Metric", Naiming Shen, Shane Amante, Mikael Abrahamsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-isis-reverse-metric-17.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism to allow IS-IS routing to quickly and accurately shift traffic away from either a point-to-point or multi-access LAN interface during network maintenance or other operational events.  This is accomplished by signaling adjacent IS-IS neighbors with a higher reverse metric, i.e., the metric towards the signaling IS-IS router.</description>
