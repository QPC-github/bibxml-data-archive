        <description>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+) services.  The purpose of enhanced VPNs is to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an approach that is based on the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and adds characteristics that specific services require over those provided by traditional VPNs.  Typically, VPN+ will be used to underpin network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites.  It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This document provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential new work.</description>
