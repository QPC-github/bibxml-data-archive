    <title>"Trust Anchor Key Renewal Method Applied to X.509 Self-signed Certificates  (TAKREM-X.509)", Thierry Moreau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moreau-pkix-takrem-01.txt</link>
    <description>In the Internet PKI, trust anchor keys are distributed as self- signed X.509 security certificates. This document specifies a trust anchor key renewal mechanism that leverages the confidence in the initial certificate distribution. A non-critical X.509 certificate extension holds a sequence of opaque octet strings. The trust anchor renewal operation occurs upon receipt of a message that hashes to one of those octet strings.</description>
