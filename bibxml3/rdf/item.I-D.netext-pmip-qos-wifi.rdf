    <title>"Mapping 802.11 QoS in a PMIPv6 Mobility Domain", John Kaippallimalil, Rajesh Pazhyannur, Parviz Yegani</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-netext-pmip-qos-wifi-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a model for enabling end to end QoS in systems where there is a 802.11 based wireless system coupled with a PMIPv6 mobility domain consisting a local mobility anchor and mobility access gateway. This enables QoS policing and labeling of packets in a consistent manner on the 802.11 link between the MN and the AP as well as the link between the MAG and the LMA. To enable this, the document specifies mapping between QoS parameters on the 802.11 link and the QoS Mobility options in the PMIPv6 domain.</description>
