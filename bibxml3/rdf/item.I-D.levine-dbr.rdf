    <description>Domains can authenticate their outgoing mail using DKIM or other techniques.  In some cases where miscreants frequently use a domain without authorization in the Author address in e-mail messages, it may be prudent for recipient mail systems to discard unauthenticated mail as likely to be fraudulent.  This specification defines an extension to Vouch by Reference (VBR) that allows a certifier to identify such domains, and that recipients can use either in conjunction with or independently of VBR.</description>
