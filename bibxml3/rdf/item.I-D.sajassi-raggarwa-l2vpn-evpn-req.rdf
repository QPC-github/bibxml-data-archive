    <description>The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of new applications for the technology (e.g. data center interconnect) have culminated in a new set of requirements that are not readily addressable by the current VPLS solution. In particular, multi- homing with all-active forwarding is not supported and there's no existing solution to leverage MP2MP LSPs for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames. Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even in the context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network operators to specify various network parameters on top of the access configuration. This document specifies the requirements for an Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) solution which addresses the above issues.</description>
