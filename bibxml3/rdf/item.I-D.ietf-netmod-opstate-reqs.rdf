    <title>"Terminology and Requirements for Enhanced Handling of Operational State", Kent Watsen, Thomas Nadeau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document primarily regards the difference between the intended configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how intended and applied configuration relate to the operational state of a device.  This document defines requirements for the applied configuration's data model and its values, as well as for enabling a client to know when a configuration has been fully applied or not, how to access operational state, and how to relate intended configuration nodes to applied configuration and derived state nodes.</description>
