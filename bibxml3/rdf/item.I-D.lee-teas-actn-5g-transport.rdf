    <description>This draft is aimed to provide an applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (ACTN) for an end-to- end service assurance mechanism for 5G transport network. ACTN is an IETF standard architecture enabling virtual network operations to control and manage large-scale multi-domain, multi-layer and multi-vendor TE networks, so as to facilitate network programmability, automation, efficient resource sharing. 3GPP 5G requirements calls for Network Slicing support for various use cases such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine- type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC). In order to support these new requirements over multiple transport networks for 5G transport, the current 3GPP 5G architecture needs to support dynamic instantiation of end-to-end paths that assure service assurance and performance guarantee for traffic classes characterized by network slicing.</description>
