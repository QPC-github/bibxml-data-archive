    <title>"Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of New Protocols", David Harrington</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-harrington-operations-and-management-01.txt</link>
    <description>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due consideration of operations and management issues related to the protocol. Retrofitting operations and management recommendations to protocols is sub-optimal. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to authors of protocol documents about aspects to consider related to the operations and management that should be considered for inclusion in documents defining requirements or functionality of new protocols or protocol extensions.</description>
