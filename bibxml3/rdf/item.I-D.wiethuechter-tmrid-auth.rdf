    <description>This document describes how to include trust into the proposed ASTM Remote ID specification defined in WK65041 by the F38 Committee under a Broadcast Remote ID (RID) scenario.  It defines a few different message schemes (based on the authentication message) that can be used to assure past messages sent by a UA and also act as an assurance for UA trustworthiness in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node.</description>
