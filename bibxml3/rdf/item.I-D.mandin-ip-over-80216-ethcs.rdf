    <title>"Transport of IP over 802.16", Jeff Mandin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mandin-ip-over-80216-ethcs-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this memo we describe a simple scheme for configuration and provisioning of an 802.16 network so that it emulates a broadcast network that uses the 802.3 packet format. We briefly describe how this network supports IPv4 and IPv6 services in a manner similar to other broadcast media (eg. ethernet). Finally, we review some architectural issues behind the choice of broadcast network emulation and examine alternative approaches to supporting IP over 802.16. We additionally describe some possible system optimizations to reduce consumption of air resources.</description>
