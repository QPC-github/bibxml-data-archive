    <title>"DHCP Options for Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS)", Mohamed Boucadair</title>

    <description>It may not be possible for a network to determine the cause for an attack, but instead just realize that some resources seem to be under attack.  To fill that gap, Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) allows a network to inform a server that it is under a potential attack so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken.  This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure hosts with DOTS servers.</description>
