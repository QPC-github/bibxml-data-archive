    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-cmc-archive-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a set of extensions to the CMC (Certificate Management over CMS) protocol that address the desire for having two additional services: 1) Server side generation of keys, 2) server-side escrow and subsequent recovery of key material. These services are provided by the definition of additional control statements within the CMC architecture.</description>
