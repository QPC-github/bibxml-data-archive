    <description>It is expected that future mobile devices will equip multiple wireless interfaces in order to access the Internet ubiquitously. For such a multimode mobile node (MMN) that might have multiple home addresses to associate with its interfaces, the MMN has to keep its interfaces awake to listen the packets to these home addresses (HoAs). Therefore, the MMN consumes a considerable energy to maintain the reachablilities of these HoAs/interfaces. The draft presents the benefits to use multiple care-of addresses and/or home addresses to save the idle-mode power consumption of an MMN, and also discusses the impacts and the requirements of the existing IETF protocols to support the proposed low power operations.</description>
