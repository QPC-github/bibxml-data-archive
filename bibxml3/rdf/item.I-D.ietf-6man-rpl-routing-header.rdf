    <description>In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers may limit them to maintaining at most a few routes.  In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g. the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory constrained routers.  This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL Instance.</description>
