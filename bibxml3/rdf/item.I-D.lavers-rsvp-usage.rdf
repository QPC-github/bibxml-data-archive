    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lavers-rsvp-usage-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a number of resource control requirements that enterprise network administrators face.  It also discusses how RSVP is being used, or considered, in order to address these requirements.  This document is offered as input to the IETF 77 RSVP mini-BOF.  The authors recommend that the IETF continues supporting RSVP as a Standards Track protocol and continue facilitating development of necessary RSVP extensions in the Standards Track.</description>
