    <title>"Improved Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (IHMIPv6) Mobility Management", Zhengming Ma, Lin Wang</title>

    <description>In HMIPv6 (RFC5213), a mobile node has three IPv6 addresses: HoA, RCoA and LCoA.  Outside the domain of a MAP, RCoA is used for routing, while HoA is used for authentication.  Hence HA and CN should maintain the binding of RCoA and HoA.  Inside the domain of a MAP, RCoA is used for authentication, while LCoA is used for routing. Hence MAP should maintain the binding of RCoA and LCoA.  Since RCoA is used for authentication, it should be unique to a mobile node. Therefore, how many mobile nodes there are inside domain of a MAP, how many different RCoAs the MAP has to allocate to the mobile nodes. In this Internet Draft, an improved or alternative solution to HMIPv6 is presented, where RCoA is no longer used for authentication inside the domains of a MAP.  RCoA is used only for routing outside the domain of a MAP, as LCoA does inside the domain of a MAP.  Inside the domain of a MAP, HoA is used for authentication, as it does outside the domain of a MAP.  Since RCoA is no longer used for authentication, only one RCoA will be enough for all mobile nodes inside the domain of a MAP.  Remark: This Internet Draft is based on HMIPv6 (RFC5380).  Only those parts in HMIPv6 related to RCoA have been rewritten, while the other parts in HMIPv6 remain almost unchanged.</description>
