    <title>"RPL Mode of Operation extension", Rahul Jadhav, Pascal Thubert</title>

    <description>RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes to have a consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join the network.  The MOP field in RFC6550 is of 3 bits and is fast depleting.  This document extends the MOP field specification and adds a notion of capabilities using which the nodes can further advertise their support for, possibly optional, capabilities.</description>
