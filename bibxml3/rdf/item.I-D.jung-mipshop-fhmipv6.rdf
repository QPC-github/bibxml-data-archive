    <title>"Fast Handover for Hierarchical MIPv6 (F-HMIPv6)", HeeYoung Jung</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jung-mipshop-fhmipv6-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. The HMIPv6 was developed to reduce the signaling overhead and delay concerned with Binding Update in Mobile IPv6. Therefore HMIPv6 still need a further handover enhancement for supporting the real-time applications. Currently FMIPv6 is the typical protocol to reduce the handover latency. Accordingly it may be straightforward to simply introduce FMIPv6 into HMIPv6 networks. However, it is noted that such simple approach may induce unnecessary processing overhead. F-HMIPv6, described in this document, considers how to integrate these two protocols and provides a scheme for effective integration.</description>
