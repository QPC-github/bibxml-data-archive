    <title>"Use of Name Redaction for Mass Devices", Tadahiko Ito, Robert Ramirez</title>

    <description>This document describes mechanisms to allow CT log submitters not to submit plain certificates.  While public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs allow anyone to observe server certificates and make confident to trust Certificate Authorities (CAs), there are some problems scaling to mass devices.  This document describes and presents some use cases for a mechanism that retains most of the security benefits gained from using Certificate Transparency.</description>
