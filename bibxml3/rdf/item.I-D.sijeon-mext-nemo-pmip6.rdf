    <description>Network mobility (NEMO) enables all the nodes within a mobile network to provide session continuity without requiring their involvement when the mobile network moves. To provide NEMO support, the NEMO basic support protocol (NEMO-BSP) is specified in [RFC 3963].  With the advances of the network-based mobility management protocol referred to as Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), interest in applicable NEMO support in the PMIPv6 domain is increasing however, the standard PMIPv6, defined in [RFC 5213], handles only a single mobile node.  This document presents a NEMO-enabled PMIPv6 using a Proxy Router (PR) rather than the MR defined in [RFC 3963] and describes detailed operations for network/node mobility support in the PMIPv6 domain.</description>
