    <description>After a UDP protocol such as RTP determines a network path is experiencing problems, a traceroute is often useful to determine which router or which link is contributing to the problem.  However, operating system traceroute commands follow a different path than the actual UDP flow which complicates troubleshooting.  A superior method is shown which is absolutely path-congruent with the UDP protocol itself, works on IPv4 and IPv6, and does not require administrative privileges on most operating systems.</description>
