    <title>"IAB Thoughts on Encodings for Internationalized Domain Names", Dave Thaler, John Klensin, Stuart Cheshire</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-idn-encoding-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document explores issues with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that result from the use of various encoding schemes such as UTF-8 and the ASCII-Compatible Encoding produced by the Punycode algorithm.  It focuses on the importance of agreeing on a canonical format and how complicated it ends up being as a result of using different encodings today.</description>
