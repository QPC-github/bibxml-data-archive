    <description>This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice gateway that is a data plane function or function group for connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose network slice subnets and providing network slices from end to end.  The interworkings between management and control elements at the management and control planes with the gateway function for controlling and orchestrating end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.</description>
