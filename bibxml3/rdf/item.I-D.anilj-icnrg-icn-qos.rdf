    <description>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is shaping up as an alternative networking mechanism for the TCP/IP based host-centric networking paradigm.  Content delivery or streaming is one of important use cases where the real value and potential of ICN architecture is being investigated.  While a number of studies on an optimal and efficient routing of Interest requests have been published, more discussion is needed on the mechanisms for implementation and enforcement of the quality of service (QoS) in the ICN based data delivery path.  In this document, we focus on two most popular ICN architectures, CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) and describe how we can achieve the QoS aware data delivery in the ICN network.  We propose to use the differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model based on DSCP codes, which is also used in the IP based Internet design.  We further present how QoS parameter syntax can be added to the current CCNx messages.</description>
