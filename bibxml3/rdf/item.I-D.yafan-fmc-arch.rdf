    <title>"An Architecture Framework For Fixed Mobile Convergence Using SIP as Access  Call Control Protocol", Yafan An</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yafan-fmc-arch-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an architecture framework for achieving converged mobile services across alternative radio access networks (GAN, or Generic Access Network), such as WLAN, WiMax, and the cellular network, while utilizing SIP for media session control between the dual mode handset (DMH) and a network SIP proxy. The key benefits of this architecture include (1) fast and flexible service deployment in the IP domain, and (2) allow seamless voice call continuity services across IP and circuit-switched cellular domains.</description>
