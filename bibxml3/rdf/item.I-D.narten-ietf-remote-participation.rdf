    <description>This document discusses some steps for improving the ability of people to remotely participate in IETF meetings. This document makes some recommendations of "best practice", that if adopted, could improve the ability for people to participate in IETF meetings without needing to physically attend meetings. Improving the ability of participants to contribute and participate remotely would improve the overall effectiveness of the IETF and improve the quality of the work it produces.</description>
