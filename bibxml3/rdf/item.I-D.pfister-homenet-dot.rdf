    <title>"Special Use Top Level Domain '.homenet'", Pierre Pfister</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pfister-homenet-dot-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.homenet.', thereby defining this top-level domain as a special-use domain name [RFC6761].  The '.homenet' top-level domain intends to replace '.home' which was originally proposed in [RFC7788] as default domain-name for home networks.</description>
