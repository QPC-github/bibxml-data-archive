    <description>The Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) has limitations to illustrate the network condition and to work with the OpenFlow protocol.  This document extends ECS to improve the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol by (1) defining more types of endpoint address such as port number, protocol type, domain and etc; (2) adding flow constraints.</description>
