    <description>This document specifies the requirements for a MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  This document is a product of a joint International Telecommunications Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include a MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS architecture to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T). This work is based on two sources of requirements, MPLS architecture as defined by IETF and packet transport networks as defined by ITU-T.</description>
