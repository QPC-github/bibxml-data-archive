    <description>BGP is used as the only routing protocol in some networks today.  In such networks, it is useful to get a detailed view of the nodes and underlying links in the topology along with their attributes similar to one available when using link state routing protocols.  Such a view of a BGP-only fabric enables use cases like traffic engineering and forwarding of services along paths other than the BGP best path selection.  This document defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family (BGP-LS) and the procedures for advertisement of the topology in a BGP-only network.  It also describes a specific use-case for traffic engineering based on Segment Routing.</description>
