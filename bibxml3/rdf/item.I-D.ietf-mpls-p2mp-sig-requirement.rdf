    <title>"Signaling Requirements for Point to Multipoint Traffic Engineered MPLS  LSPs", Seisho Yasukawa</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-sig-requirement-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a set of requirements for the establishment and maintenance of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). There is no intent to specify solution specific details nor application specific requirements in this document. The requirements presented in this document apply equally to packet switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols and to but also encompass the requirements of Layer two Switching (L2SC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), lambda, and port switching networks managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols. Protocol solutions developed to meet the requirements set out in this document must attempt to be equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS.</description>
