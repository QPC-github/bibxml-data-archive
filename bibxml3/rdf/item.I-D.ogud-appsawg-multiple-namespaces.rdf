    <description>Over the years there have been various proposals as to use namespaces other than the DNS/IN namespace that is under ICANN administration. Some of these were simple DNS competitors others use different lookup technologies.  In addition it is hard to supply different character encodings to DNS as each application needs to provide the translation between the encoding used and the format expected by DNS.  This draft proposes a new service layer to provide multiplexing of different namespaces into appropriate function calls.</description>
