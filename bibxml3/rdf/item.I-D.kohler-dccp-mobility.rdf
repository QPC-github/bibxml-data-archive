    <title>"Generalized Connections in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol", Eddie  Kohler</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kohler-dccp-mobility-02.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism by which the set of addresses bound to an application-level Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) connection [RFC4340] can change over that connection's lifetime. The essential abstraction is the Generalized Connection, which combines multiple distinct transport-level DCCP connections into a single application-level entity.</description>
