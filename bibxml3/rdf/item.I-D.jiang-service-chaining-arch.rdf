This document provides a general abstract architecture for service chaining. It is a flexible and scalable architecture which can fulfill requirements of service chaining. Some solutions based on this architecture are also discussed with their advantages and disadvantages. This architecture can be used as a guideline and also a criterion for the design of service chaining.</description>
