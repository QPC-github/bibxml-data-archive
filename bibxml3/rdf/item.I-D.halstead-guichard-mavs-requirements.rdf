    <title>"Requirements for Multi Autonomous System VPN Services", Martin Halstead</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-halstead-guichard-mavs-requirements-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document complements [RFC-4031] and defines requirements that are specific to the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services across multiple administrative domains. These requirements are independent of underlying technologies or the number of Autonomous Systems such VPNs may span. It lists the requirements of the different parties that are involved in the administration of these Autonomous Systems and may therefore be involved in the delivery of the VPN service offerings.</description>
