    <title>"Mobility management for Dual stack mobile nodes A Problem Statement", George  Tsirtsis, Hesham Soliman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tsirtsis-dsmip-problem-03.txt</link>
    <description>This draft discusses the issues associated with mobility management for dual stack mobile nodes. Currently, two mobility management protocols are defined for IPv4 and IPv6. Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces a number of inefficiencies. Deployment and operational issues motivate the use of a single mobility management protocol. This draft discusses such motivations. The draft also hints on how current MIPv4 and MIPv6 could be extended so that they can support mobility management for a dual stack node.</description>
