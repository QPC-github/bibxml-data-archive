    <description>IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) provides both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existence period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been defined to configure the 6rd Customer Edge (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration is mainly acquired from a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through the DHCP protocol. This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries 6rd configuration information from the AAA server to BNGs.</description>
