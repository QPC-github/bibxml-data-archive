    <title>"Service Access/Anchor Point (SAP) Based CDN Capacity/QoE Exposure", Yang Yang</title>

    <description>The objective of the Footprint and Capability Interface of CDNi is to allow a dCDN to expose information to a uCDN so that the uCDN can select a set of dCDN(s) to delivery contents for content publishers. In this draft, we propose a flexible approach for a dCDN to expose its footprint and capabilities based on a generic concept called Service Access or Anchor Point.</description>
