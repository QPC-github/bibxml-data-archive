    <description>A number of applications and services running over IP/MPLS networks have strict requirements relating to their routing, or the performance of the path supporting their traffic flow, for instance, in terms of characteristics such as latency, loss, or bandwidth availability.  Segment routing provides a means by which the data- plane of an IP/MPLS network can be programmed to support such "performance engineered" paths.  This document describes an architecture for the use of such performance engineered label switched paths, and the control-plane functionality required to allow both distributed and centralised computation of acceptable forwarding paths.</description>
