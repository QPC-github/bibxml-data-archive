    <title>"Best-case End-to-end SRTP Technique for Key Exchange interoperabilitY  (BEST-KEY)", Hadriel Kaplan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-best-srtp-keys-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an opportunistic SRTP key exchange mechanism to get the best-case SRTP keys, using a slightly modified version of Security Descriptions model [secdes], followed by a second-stage media-plane key exchange based on [XXX]. There are several distinct advantages to this mechanism over others; these benefits are documented herein. The main goal of this draft is to put forth a strawman proposal to perform a 2-stage key-exchange, first via a [secdes] style mechanism, then through a media-plane mechanism.</description>
