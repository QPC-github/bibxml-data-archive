    <description>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobility service authorization and home network prefix allocation for Proxy Mobile IPv6.  The protocol operates between a Local Mobility Anchor and a AAA server.  Furthermore, the associated specification extends the existing protocol for network access service to support dynamic assignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor during the authentication procedure.  The AAA server maintains mobile nodes' profile in a policy store, which includes information about the assigned Local Mobility Anchor as well as the home network prefix. This document proposes a further extension to allow Local Mobility Anchors benefit from the AAA server's policy store and resolve an unknown mobile node's IP address into a routable address of its assigned Local Mobility Anchor.</description>
