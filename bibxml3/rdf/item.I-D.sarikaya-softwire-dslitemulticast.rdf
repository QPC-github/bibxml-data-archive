    <title>"Multicast Support for Dual Stack Lite", Behcet Sarikaya</title>

    <description>This memo specifies modifications required to Dual-Stack Lite (DS- Lite) so that both IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers.  The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) proxying Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and then tunneling IGMP messages over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to DS-Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast data received at AFTR is tunneled over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to B4 and then delivered to the hosts.  This solution integrates well with DS- Lite unicast solution by using IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire and works with unicast IPv6 network connecting B4 with AFTR.</description>
