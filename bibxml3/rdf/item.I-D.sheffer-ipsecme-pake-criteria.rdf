    <title>"Password-Based Authentication in IKEv2: Selection Criteria and Comparison", Yaron Sheffer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sheffer-ipsecme-pake-criteria-02.txt</link>
    <description>The IPsecME working group has been chartered with specifying a new password-based authentication method for IKEv2.  This document presents a few solution alternatives, and lists potential criteria for choosing among them.  It is not the author's intention to publish this document as an RFC.  Moreover, it is more subjective than most IETF documents.</description>
