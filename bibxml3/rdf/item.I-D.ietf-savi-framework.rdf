    <description>Source Address Validation Improvement methods were developed to prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's IP addresses, so as to complement ingress filtering with finer- grained, standardized IP source address validation.  This document is a framework document, which describes and motivates the design of the SAVI methods.  Particular SAVI methods are described in other documents.</description>
