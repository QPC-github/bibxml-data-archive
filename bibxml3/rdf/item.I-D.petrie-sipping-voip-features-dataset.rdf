    <description>This document defines the properties and format for the SIP user agent VoIP Features data set.  The properties defined in this document are expected to be common to most SIP user agents that provide VoIP capabilities.  These VoIP Feature properties are considered to be a data set.  Several types of datasets may be combined into documents that are provided to SIP user agents so that they can operate with the desired behavior.</description>
