    <title>"WiSH: A General Purpose Message Framing over Byte-Stream Oriented Wire Protocols (HTTP)", Takeshi Yoshino, Wenbo Zhu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yoshino-wish-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH which supports bi-directional (bidi) message-based communication over byte-stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics).  WiSH is designed to be compatible with WebSocket.  WiSH can be viewed as a binary and bidi alternative to the framing defined for the server-sent events (SSE, EventSource) Web API [SSE].</description>
