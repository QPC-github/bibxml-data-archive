    <title>"Load Balance for Distributed Home Agents in Mobile IPv6", Hui Deng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-deng-mip6-ha-loadbalance-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a dynamic load balance mechanism among multiple home agents by taking into account acceptable number of mobile nodes for each home agent up to now, with the goal of reducing and preventing traffic bottlenecks at the home agent. This mechanism can be used when a home agent is overloaded, wants to achieve better load-balancing with peer home agents, or is going offline for service.</description>
