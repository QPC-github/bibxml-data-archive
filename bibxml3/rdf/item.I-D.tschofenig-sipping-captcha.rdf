    <description>A common approach to deal with unwanted communication attempts is to rely on some form of authorization policies, typically whitelists. In order to populate the entries in such an access control list it is helpful to have a way to challenge the entity willing to engage in a conversation (unless they are already pre-authorized).  One reason why this is desired is to deal with robots that are aggressively distributing messages.
