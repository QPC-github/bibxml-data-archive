        <title>"BFD for Multipoint Networks over Point-to-Multi-Point MPLS LSP", Greg Mirsky, Gyan Mishra, Donald Eastlake</title>
        <dc:date>2021-09-19T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes procedures for using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for multipoint networks to detect data plane failures in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) point-to-multipoint (p2mp) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and Segment Routing (SR) point-to- multipoint policies with SR-MPLS data plane.  It also describes the applicability of LSP Ping, as in-band, and the control plane, as out-band, solutions to bootstrap a BFD session.  It also describes the behavior of the active tail for head notification.</description>
