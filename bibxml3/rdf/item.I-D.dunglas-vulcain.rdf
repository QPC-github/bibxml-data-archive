    <description>This specification defines new HTTP headers (and query parameters) allowing a client to inform the server of the exact data it needs:  *  "Preload" informs the server that relations of the main requested resource will be necessary.  The server can then reduce the number of round-trips by sending the related resources ahead of time using HTTP/2 [RFC7540] Server Push.  When using Server Push isn't possible (resources served by a different authority, client or server not supporting HTTP/2...), the server can hint the client to fetch those resources as early as possible by using the "preload" link relation [W3C.CR-preload-20190626] and the "103" status code [RFC8297].  *  "Fields" informs the server of the list of fields of the retrieved resources that will be used.  In order to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage, the server can omit the fields not requested.</description>
