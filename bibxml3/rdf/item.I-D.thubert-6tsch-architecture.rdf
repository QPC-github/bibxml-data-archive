    <title>"An Architecture for IPv6 over Timeslotted Channel Hopping", Pascal Thubert, Robert Assimiti, Thomas Watteyne</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thubert-6tsch-architecture-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by Backbone Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same backbone as classical devices.</description>
