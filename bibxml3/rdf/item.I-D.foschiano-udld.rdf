    <title>"Cisco Systems UniDirectional Link Detection (UDLD) Protocol", Marco  Foschiano</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-foschiano-udld-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Cisco Systems protocol that can be used to detect and disable unidirectional Ethernet fiber or copper links caused for instance by mis-wiring of fiber strands, interface malfunctions, media converters' faults, etc.  It operates at Layer 2 in conjunction with IEEE 802.3's existing Layer 1 fault detection mechanisms.  This document explains the protocol objectives and applications, illustrates the specific premises the protocol was based upon and describes the protocol architecture and related deployment issues, to serve as a possible base for future standardization.</description>
