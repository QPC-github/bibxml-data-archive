        <description>This document proposes some important simplifications to the original PCEP protocol and also serves to clarify certain aspects of PCEP operation.  The content of this document has been compiled based on the feedback from several multi-vendor interop exercises.  Several constructs are introduced, such as the LSP-DB and the ASSO-DB.</description>
