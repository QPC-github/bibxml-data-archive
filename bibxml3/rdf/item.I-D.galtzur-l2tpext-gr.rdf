    <title>"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (Version 3) Graceful Restart", Sharon Galtzur, Gonen Zilber</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-galtzur-l2tpext-gr-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative effects on L2TP traffic caused by L2TP Control Connection Endpoint (LCCE) control plane restart, specifically by the restart of its control protocol component, on LCCEs that are capable of preserving the L2TP forwarding component ( a.k.a. the L2TP data plane) across the restart. The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LCCEs, both those with the ability to preserve Forwarding State during the control plane (CP) restart and those without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset of the mechanism described in this document).</description>
