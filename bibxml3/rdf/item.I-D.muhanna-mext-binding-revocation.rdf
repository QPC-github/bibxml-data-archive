    <description>This document defines the revocation semantics for terminating a mobile node's mobility session and associated resources.  These semantics are generic enough and can be used by mobility entities in the case of Client Mobile IPv6 and its extensions.  This mechanism allows the mobility entity which initiates the revocation procedure to request its corresponding one to terminate either one, multiple or all specified binding cache entries.</description>
