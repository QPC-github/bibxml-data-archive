    <description>DS-Lite [RFC6333] describes an architecture for transporting IPv4 packets over an IPv6 network.  This document specifies an extension to DS-Lite called Lightweight 4over6 which moves the Network Address Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4, removing the requirement for a Carrier Grade NAT function in the AFTR.  This reduces the amount of centralized state that must be held to a per- subscriber level.  In order to delegate the NAPT function and make IPv4 Address sharing possible, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are allocated to the B4s.</description>
