    <title>"Use Cases for Resource Pools with Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)", Susan Hares</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hares-vnf-pool-use-case-02.pdf</link>
    <description>This draft describes use cases the author has observed in demonstrations or deployments for virtualized network functions (VNFs) supported by VNF Pools.  Several of these demonstrations combined VNF Pools into VNFsets.  The use cases were: cloud bursting, parental controls, load balancer for multipath (L1-L7), WAN optimization that runs either between access nodes and Data Centers, WAN optimization between mobile phones and Data Centers (through access nodes), application placement optimization, and optimized placement of web applications utilizing minimal data transfer.</description>
