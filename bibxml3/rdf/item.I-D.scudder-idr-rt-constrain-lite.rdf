    <title>"RT-Constrain Lite for Provider Edge Routers", John Scudder, James Uttaro, Pradosh Mohapatra</title>

    <description>RFC 4684, "Constrained Route Distribution for Border Gateway Protocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)" provides a powerful and general means for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate Route Target reachability information which is used for cooperative route filtering.  However, the complexity of implementing the entire specification may have impeded its widespread deployment.  This document specifies the subset of functionality which is required for a provider edge router ("PE") to originate Route Target NLRI.  Such PEs need not implement any filtering functionality.</description>
