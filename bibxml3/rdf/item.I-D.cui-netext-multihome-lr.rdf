    <description>In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should forward all traffic for the registered MN.  Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6 proposed in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using localized forwarding or tunnel between the MAGs.  But in some multi- access scenarios, it is apparently suboptimal.  The present document proposes two localized routing mechanisms that are compatible with RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs which have some interfaces attached to the same MAGs.</description>
