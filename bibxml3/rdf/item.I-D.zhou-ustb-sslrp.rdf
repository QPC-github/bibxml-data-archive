    <description>The Secure and Scalable Location Routing Protocol (SSLRP) is a secure and distributed routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks of mobile nodes with location information. Commonly, each node acquires its own geographic position using a mechanism such as the Global Position System (GPS).  The SSLRP addresses each node using the hybrid of its multi-level hierarchical address and unique identifier at the moment of network initialization.  Certain measures were adopted to ensure security of the network.</description>
