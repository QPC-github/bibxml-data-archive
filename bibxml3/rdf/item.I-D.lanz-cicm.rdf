    <title>"Common Interface to Cryptographic Modules (CICM)", Daniel Lanz, Lev Novikov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lanz-cicm-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a programming interface to standardize the way software programs manage cryptographic modules and use cryptographic services offered by modules.  Although a number of interfaces for commercial environments have been standardized and are in use, this is the first generic cryptographic interface to be developed that supports cryptographic modules separating two security domains and is thus ideal for the high assurance environment.  The interface has been designed to also allow less demanding environments to take advantage of its features.</description>
