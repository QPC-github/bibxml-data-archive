    <title>"Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions", Thomas Keiser</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear-02.txt</link>
    <description>RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer for AFS-3.  Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications which require identity assertions in order to ensure that the desired peer receives and processes a procedure call.  This memo defines a replacement for the rxnull security class which provides a means for mutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without incurring cryptographic overhead.  It should be noted that, much like rxnull, this security object is not suitable for use in a distributed environment due to its inability to provide integrity protection.</description>
