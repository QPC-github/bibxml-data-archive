    <title>"Generic Action RPC for Netconf", Balazs Lengyel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lengyel-action-rpc-00.txt</link>
    <description>The NETCONF protocol defines a number of operations to read and write configuration data. However, it does not define actions on the managed nodes. Such actions are useful for 1) operations that do not change the configuration data (e.g. ping) 2) reading or writing a set of data that forms a logical group but might be scattered in different parts of the management data model. This document defines a new Netconf capability supporting a generic &lt;action> operation. A modeling view of how the content of the generic &lt;action> operation can be defined is also described. Please send comments to netconf@ops.ietf.org. To subscribe, use netconf-request@ops.ietf.org.</description>
