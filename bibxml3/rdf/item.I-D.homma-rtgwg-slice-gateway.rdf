    <description>This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice gateway that is a function or function group for handling data plane traffic, such as connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose network slice subnet instances and providing network slices from end to end.  The interworking between management and control elements at the management and control planes with the gateway function for controlling and orchestrating end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.</description>
