    <title>"Suggested Practices for Registration of Internationalized Domain Names  (IDN)", John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klensin-reg-guidelines-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document explores the issues in registration of internationalized domain names (IDNs). The basic IDN definition potentially allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names. To avoid this confusion, it is necessary for the IDN registration process to impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations. This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names to other languages and scripts.</description>
