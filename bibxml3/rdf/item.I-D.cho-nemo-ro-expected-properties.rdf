    <description>This memo categorizes the route optimization problem of NEMO and clarifies the expected properties of the route optimization protocols. The route optimization can be classified into NEMO optimization and nested NEMO optimization. Since NEMO basic support protocol is based on bi-directional tunneling, the packets from the CN to the MNN are suffer from inefficient routing all the cases. This routing inefficiency is getting worse when a number of MRs are nested. This memo is especially interested in nested NEMO optimization. To solve the routing inefficiency problem, there were several proposals. However, those proposals could not be compared or evaluated properly since there was no consensus on the expected properties of nested mobile networks. This memo is willing to suggest the expected properties of nested mobile networks, so as to help coming route optimization proposals find their strength and weakness according to the commonly accepted desirable properties.</description>
