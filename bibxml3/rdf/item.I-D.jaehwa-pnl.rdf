    <description>An important challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is that how to route data packets from sources to base station energy efficiently. Inspiring data fusion feature and multi-hop routing, in this document, we introduce a clustering approach called PLIR (Prolonging Network Lifetime via Intra-Cluster Routing) for saving energy and distributing data dissipation evenly by improving BS cluster formation algorithm of LEACH-Centralized and providing 3-hop routing algorithm within clusters. Hence, it prolongs the lifetime of WSN. PLIR consumes less energy and reduces communication overhead, and extends the network lifetime compared with other approaches.</description>
