    <description>This document describes some characteristics of communication between nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network.  These are not requirements in the sense usually understood as applying to formulation of a requirements document.  Nevertheless, protocol engineers and system analysts involved with designing solutions for ad hoc networks must maintain awareness of these characteristics.</description>
