    <description>This document proposes the addition of two new values to the "SameSite" cookie attribute defined in RFC6265bis [I-D.ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis]: "FirstPartyLax" and "FirstPartyStrict".  These values are conceptually similar to the existing "Lax" and "Strict" values, but base the delivery checks on the First-Party Sets [first-party-set] of a request's initiator and target, rather than on their respective registrable domains.  This widens the scope of a given cookie's applicability, enabling entities that have sharded themselves across multiple registrable domains to maintain HTTP state without exposing themselves to the risks of "SameSite=None".</description>
