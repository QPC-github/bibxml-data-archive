    <description>Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a routing information base (RIB).  Protocols and configuration push data into the RIB and the RIB manager install state into the hardware; for packet forwarding.  This draft specifies an information model for the RIB to enable defining a standardized data model.  Such a data model can be used to define an interface to the RIB from an entity that may even be external to the network device.  This interface can be used to support new use-cases being defined by the IETF I2RS WG.</description>
