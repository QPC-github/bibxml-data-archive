    <title>"The AddressOrPrefix Derived AVP Data Format For Diameter", Tom Taylor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-taylor-dime-addressorprefix-00.txt</link>
    <description>Section 4.3.1 of the Diameter base specification [RFC6733] defines a number of derived AVP data formats.  This collection includes the Address format, which is suitable for encoding complete addresses. In some potential applications, however, there is a requirement to encode a prefix rather than a complete address.  This document defines the AddressOrPrefix derived AVP data format, modelled after the Address format defined in [RFC6733], but allowing the same AVP to represent a prefix of any length up to a full address.  This document updates RFC 6733.</description>
