    <title>"Formalizing IETF Interoperability Reporting", Larry Masinter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-newtrk-interop-reports-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document suggests another way of reforming IETF standards process by formalizing the mechanism for interoperability reporting, as a way of facilitating standards development. It establishes two kinds of reports: a 'Protocol Feature Set', which lays out the set of features from IETF specifications that constitute a protocol, and a 'Protocol Implementation Report', which is submitted by an individual or group to report on implementation and interoperability testing.</description>
