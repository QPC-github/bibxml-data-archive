    <title>"Extensions to RSVP-TE Fast Reroute", Jiang Weilian</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-weilian-mpls-fast-reroute-ext-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines extensions to the Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanism of Facility Backup defined in RFC4090. Through the extensions, the node that has set up FRR relation is capable of notifying the tail node of backup tunnel to act as Merge Point (MP) of the protected and backup tunnels. In addition, after the FRR switchover, PLR and MP nodes can refresh the protocol state of protected tunnel by the Refresh message of backup tunnel, so that the protocol messages of protected tunnel don't need to be refreshed through the backup tunnel.</description>
