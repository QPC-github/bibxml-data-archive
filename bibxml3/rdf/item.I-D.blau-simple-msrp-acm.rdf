    <title>"An Alternative Connection Model for the Message Session Relay Protocol  (MSRP)", Staffan Blau, Christer Holmberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blau-simple-msrp-acm-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs. The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975 and RFC4976 in the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connection establishment, and it allows the usage of SDP in a more conventional way for conveying endpoint address information.  Because of this, the model also allows for the usage of generic mainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.</description>
