    <description>This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaces which uses Mobile IPv6[1]. With multiple interfaces, the mobile terminal may use them simultaneously for communication with a peer device. Hence enabling the mobile terminal to achieve fault tolerance, load balancing and so on. This document deals with the mobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that each kind/type of interface may have its own characteristics or differences. In particular, we take a closer look at the path between mobile terminal and its home agent. In the case when the mobile terminal has multiple interfaces, there exists several paths to the home agent. A general approach would be to first take a look at effective use of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6 perspective. As a matter of course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference with which we consider the multiple interfaced mobile terminal operating in a Mobile IPv6 environment.</description>
