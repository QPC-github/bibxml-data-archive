    <description>OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from apps running entirely in a browser are unable to use a Client Secret during the process, since they have no way to keep a secret confidential.  This specification details the security considerations that must be taken into account when developing browser-based applications, as well as best practices for how they can securely implement OAuth 2.0.</description>
