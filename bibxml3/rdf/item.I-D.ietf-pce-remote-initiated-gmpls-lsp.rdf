    <description>[RFC8281] specifies procedures that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs in the active stateful PCE model. However, this specification focuses on MPLS networks, and does not cover remote instantiation of paths in GMPLS-controlled networks. This document complements [RFC8281] by addressing the requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.</description>
