    <title>"Assignment of an Associated Channel Type for Packet Transport Network Applications", Greg Jones</title>

    <description>The Transport Profile of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS- TP) is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Pseudowire (PW) data plane architectures applicable in various deployment environments.  This document describes the allocation of an Associated Channel Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport network (PTN) applications, such as Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), and applicable to MPLS-TP Pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) and Sections.  This document is intended to become a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
