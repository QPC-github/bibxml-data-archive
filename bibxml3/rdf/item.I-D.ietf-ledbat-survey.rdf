    <title>"A Survey of Lower-than-Best-Effort Transport Protocols", Michael Welzl, David Ros</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ledbat-survey-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a survey of transport protocols which are designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used for delay-insensitive "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a "less than" (or "lower than") best-effort service.</description>
