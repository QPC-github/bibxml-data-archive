    <title>"Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)", Marc Petit-Huguenin, Gonzalo Salgueiro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tram-stun-dtls-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  It provides guidances on when and how to use DTLS with the currently standardized STUN Usages.  It also specifies modifications to the STUN URIs and TURN URIs and to the TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate the resolution of STUN URIs and TURN URIs into the IP address and port of STUN and TURN servers supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.  This document updates RFC 5389 and RFC 5928.</description>
