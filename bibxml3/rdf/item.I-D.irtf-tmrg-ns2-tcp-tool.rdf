    <title>"An NS2 TCP Evaluation Tool", Guoquang Wang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-tmrg-ns2-tcp-tool-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces a TCP performance evaluation tool for the network simulator NS2. This tool is motivated by the observation that there is significant overlap among (but lack of an agreed set of) the topologies, traffic, and metrics used by many researchers in the evaluation of TCP alternatives: effort could be saved by starting research from an existing framework. As such, our tool includes several typical topologies and traffic models; it measures some of the most important metrics commonly used in TCP evaluation; and it can automatically generate simulation statistics and graphs ready for inclusion in latex and html documents. The tool also contains an extendable open-source framework. With community effort, we hope the tool evolves into a widely accepted, well-defined set of TCP performance evaluation benchmarks.</description>
