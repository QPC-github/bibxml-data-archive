    <title>"SIP-based Bicasting for Seamless Handover between Heterogeneous Networks", Haruki Izumikawa, Ross Lillie</title>

    <description>A vertical session handoff occurs in heterogeneous networks when a session media is moved between access networks within the same device.  During session handoff, bi-casting media streams to both access networks of the session's device may be desirable to insure a seamless session handoff.  This document describes the general methods and specifies the signaling and media flows for providing this service using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].</description>
