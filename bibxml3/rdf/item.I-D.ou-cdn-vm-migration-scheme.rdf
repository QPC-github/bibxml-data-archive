    <description>Virtual machine migration is a critical requirement in today's data centers to support services dynamically deployed in distributed infrastructures.  To keep the uniform environment required by application software, large number of networking based solutions have been presented to provide data center interconnection for virtual resource management.  Aiming at simplifying networking complexities in off-site service deployment, this document presents a framework based on content delivery network for supporting virtual machine migration over the legacy wide area network.</description>
