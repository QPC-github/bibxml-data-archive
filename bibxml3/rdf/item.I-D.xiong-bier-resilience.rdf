    <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  In some scenarios, the resilience should be provided to guarantee the multicast data is protected by a given backup resource and forwarded successfully to the receivers in BIER-specific network.  This document discusses the resilience use cases, requirements and proposes solutions for BIER, including the protection and restoration mechanisms and detection methods.</description>
