    <title>"The TCP Service Number Option (SNO)", Joseph Touch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-touch-tcpm-sno-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a TCP option for service numbers. The current SYN destination port is used both to indicate the desired service and as a connection demultiplexing field. This option separates those two functions, retaining the current destination port solely for demultiplexing and indicating the service separately in a service number option (SNO). By decoupling these two functions, SNO allows a larger number of concurrent connections for a single service, as might be useful between fixed addresses of proxies.</description>
