    <description>This document provides an information model of information needed by the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of information described in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in WSONs. In particular in cases where there are no or a limited number of wavelength converters available in the WSON. This model currently does not include optical impairments.</description>
