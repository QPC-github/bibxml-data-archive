    <description>In centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architecture, the Access Controller (AC) isn't intelligent enough actually to aggregate all the wireless frames, even the bandwidth requirement in the access point is increasing.  Thus it is a general case in the existing operator's network that WTPs forward the wireless frames directly to Access Router (AR) to avoid overload on the AC.  In this scenario, CAPWAP Control Channel and CAPWAP Data Channel are separated from each other.  This document extends CAPWAP for applicability of CAPWAP Control and Data Channel separation.</description>
