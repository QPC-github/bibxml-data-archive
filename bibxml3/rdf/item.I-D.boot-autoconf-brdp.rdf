    <title>"Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP) based Address Autoconfiguration", Teco Boot, Arjen Holtzer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boot-autoconf-brdp-02.txt</link>
    <description>Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) may be attached to a fixed infrastructure network, like the Internet.  This document specifies a mechanism for Border Router discovery and utilization in such a subordinate, possibly multi-homed, MANET.  It provides facilities for choosing preferred Border Router(s) and configuring IP address(es) needed for communication between MANET nodes and nodes on the Internet via the selected Border Router.  Autonomous MANETs do not have Border Routers; a self-sufficient Address Autoconfiguration mechanism for Autonomous MANETs is defined as well.</description>
