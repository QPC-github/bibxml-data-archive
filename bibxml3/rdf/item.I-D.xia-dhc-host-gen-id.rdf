    <description>This document describes a procedure for configuring hosts' IPv6 address which the prefix is assigned from a DHCPv6 server through DHCPv6 protocol while the interface identifiers are independently generated by the hosts.  The method is applicable to Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA), and other host-generated IPv6 addresses.</description>
