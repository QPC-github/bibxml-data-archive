    <title>"Controlled Delay Approximate Fairness AQM", Jonathan Morton, Peter Heist</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-morton-tsvwg-codel-approx-fair-01.txt</link>
    <description>This note presents CodelAF, or Controlled Delay Approximate Fairness in full, as an alternative to single-queue AQM or Fair Queue implementations in the low-cost or high-speed network hardware spaces.  It builds on the seminal work in Codel [RFC8289], and guides multiple competing flows towards similar throughputs by differential congestion signalling, whilst requiring only a single FIFO queue.  It may also be combined with CNQ [I-D.morton-tsvwg-cheap-nasty-queueing] to provide a latency optimisation for sparse flows.</description>
