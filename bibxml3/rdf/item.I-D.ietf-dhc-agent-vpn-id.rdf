    <description>In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element which also has access to one or more virtual private networks (VPNs). If a DHCP server wishes to offer service to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCP server needs to know information about the VPN on which each client resides. The Virtual Subnet Selection sub- option of the relay-agent-information option is used by the relay agent to tell the DHCP server important information about the VPN (called the Virtual Subnet Selection information, or VSS) for every DHCP request it passes on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forward any DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.</description>
