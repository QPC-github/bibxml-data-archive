    <description>AS_Path prepending provides a tool to manipulate the BGP AS_Path attribute through prepending multiple entries of an AS.  AS_Path prepend is used to deprioritize a route or alternate path.  By prepending the local ASN multiple times, ASes can make advertised AS paths appear artificially longer.  Excessive AS_Path prepending has caused routing issues in the internet.  This document provides guidance,to the internet community, with how best to utilize AS_Path prepend in order to avoid negatively affecting the internet.</description>
