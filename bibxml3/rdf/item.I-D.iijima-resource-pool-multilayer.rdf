    <title>"Resource Pooling Mechanism for Multi-Layer Operations", Tomoyuki Iijima</title>

    <description>This memo proposes resource pooling mechanism for multi-layer operations.  Resource pool is often discussed in the context of robustness and restoration.  But, resource pooling mechanism should also be used for realizing flexibility in multi-layer network operations.  Today, it takes days or weeks of lead time to change wide area networks composed of multiple network layers.  One of the reasons is because communications between operators of different network layers are necessary before configuration of each layer is made.  A network management system that uses resource pooling mechanism would get rid of communications made between operators of different network layers, and would realize flexible changes in multi-layer networks.</description>
