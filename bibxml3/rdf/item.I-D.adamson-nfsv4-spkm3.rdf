    <title>"Low Infrastructure Mutual Authentication Using SPKM-3", William Adamson, Olga Kornievskaia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-adamson-nfsv4-spkm3-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API [RFC2078] to supply a secure channel between a user on a client and a server, authenticating both the user and server with public key certificates [RFC3280], without the need for an external Public Key Infrastructure for certificate verification. The method leverages the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism Version 3 (SPKM-3) [RFC2847]. In addition to describing the use of SPKM-3 for mutual authentication, this memorandum updates RFC2847, reflecting implementation experience.</description>
