    <title>"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks", Matt Crawford, Robert Hinden</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hinden-6man-rfc2464bis-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the frame format for transmission of IPv6 packets and the method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured addresses on Ethernet networks.  It also specifies the content of the Source/Target Link-layer Address option used in Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement and Redirect messages when those messages are transmitted on an Ethernet.  This document replaces RFC 2464 "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks", which will become historic.</description>
