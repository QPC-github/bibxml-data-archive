    <description>In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections are controlled either by a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by a Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently coexist, the ability of transforming an existing PC into a SPC and vice versa - without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it - is a requirement.  The requirements for the conversion between permanent connections and switched connections in a GMPLS Network are defined in [RFC5493].  This memo describes an extension to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling that enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management and the Control Planes.  Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover.  This document defines all Handover related procedures. This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state.  A basic premise of the extension is that the handover procedures must never impact an already established Data plane connection.</description>
