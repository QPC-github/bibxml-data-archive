    <title>"Glue A RR to the No Data Answer of AAAA RR", Zheng Wang, Cindy Wang, XiaoDong Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-dns-a-aaaa-00.txt</link>
    <description>Many existing DNS clients (resolvers) and applications that support IPv6 first search for AAAA Resource Records (RR) of a target host name, and if no data, then for A RR of the same name. This memo proposes adding A RR in the additional section for the no data answer of AAAA RR, which can save a request for A RR.</description>
