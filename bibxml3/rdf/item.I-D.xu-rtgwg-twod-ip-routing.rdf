    <description>This document describes Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing, a new Internet routing architecture which makes forwarding decisions based on both source address and destination address.  This presents a fundamental extension from the current Internet, which makes forwarding decisions based on the destination address, and provides shortest single-path routing towards destination.  Such extension provides rooms to solve fundamental problems of the past and foster great innovations in the future.  We present the TwoD-IP routing framework and its two underpinning schemes.  The first is a new hardware-based forwarding table structure for TwoD-IP, FIST, which achieves line-speed lookup with acceptable storage space.  The second is a policy routing protocol that flexibly diverts traffic.</description>
