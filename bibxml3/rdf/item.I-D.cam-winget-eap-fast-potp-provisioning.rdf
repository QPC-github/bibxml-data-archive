    <description>EAP-FAST is an extensible EAP method that enables the provisioning of credentials or other information by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  As the tunnel may be unauthenticated, EAP-FAST further enables the use of inner EAP methods to establish mutual authentication prior to provisioning.  This document describes how EAP-POTP may be used as the EAP-FAST inner method for credential provisioning.</description>
