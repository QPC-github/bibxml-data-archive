    <title>"A Formal Model for Media Negotiation between SIP User Agents", Alberto Cuda, Enrico Marocco</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cuda-sipping-ua-fsm-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a formal description of the interactions between two SIP User Agents establishing a multimedia session, describing the negotiation of the two parties as an exchange of signals between two instances of networks of Finite State Machines (FSMs). The goal is to provide a common reference model for both SIP extensions and User Agent implementations: two flows that can be implemented by using the external interface of the FSMs are guaranteed not to conflict to each other. On the other hand a reference model for User Agents is expected to improve interoperability between different implementations and help implementors to model their software in a way that makes SIP extensions conforming to this document easier to implement.</description>
