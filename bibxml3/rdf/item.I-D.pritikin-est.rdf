    <title>"Enrollment over Secure Transport", Max Pritikin</title>

    <description>This document specifies a protocol for certificate Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).  EST is a certificate enrollment protocol that operates over HTTPS, and thus should be trivially accessible by modern clients.  The Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) "Simple PKI Request" and "Simple PKI Response" messages are leveraged.  EST is designed to be easily implemented by clients and servers running other common enrollment mechanisms such as Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).  Renewal and rekey mechanisms are described consistent with Certificate Management Protocol (CMP).</description>
