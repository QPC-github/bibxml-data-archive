    <title>"Review and Recommendations for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)", John  Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-idn-nextsteps-06.txt</link>
    <description>This note describes issues raised by the deployment and use of Internationalized Domain Names. It describes problems both at the time of registration and those for use of those names for use in the DNS. It recommends that IETF should update the IDN related RFCs and a framework to be followed in doing so, as well as summarizing and identifying some work that is required outside the IETF. In particular, it proposes that some changes be investigated for the IDNA standard and its supporting tables, based on experience gained since those standards were completed.</description>
