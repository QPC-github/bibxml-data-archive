    <title>"Mesh Under IPv6 Routing Requirements", Edward Beroset</title>

    <description>Wireless mesh routing for low cost wireless mesh devices can be done at a layer under IPv6.  This document examines the functional requirements of this kind of routing and to explore why this approach might be used in some contexts.  It should be noted that this kind of routing is orthogonal to IP-level routing; there is no inherent conflict between the two.</description>
