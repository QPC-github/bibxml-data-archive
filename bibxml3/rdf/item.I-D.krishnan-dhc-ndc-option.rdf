    <description>Neighbor discovery options, in addition to being used for Neighbor Discovery, are used to convey some forms of network configuration information to the hosts attached to a network.  Some centrally managed networks, that do not wish to configure their routers to advertise these pieces of information, might use a DHCP server to configure there parameters.  This document defines a generic DHCP option for carrying these parameters.</description>
