    <title>"DBOUND: DNS Administrative Boundaries Problem Statement", Andrew Sullivan, Jeff Hodges, John R. Levine</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sullivan-dbound-problem-statement-02.txt</link>
    <description>Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences about the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based on the domain names at which they are offered.

Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale.  This memo outlines what issues are to be addressed.</description>
