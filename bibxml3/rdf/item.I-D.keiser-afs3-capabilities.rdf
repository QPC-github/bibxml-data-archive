    <title>"AFS-3 Protocol Capabilities Query Mechanism", Thomas Keiser, Steven Jenkins, Andrew Deason</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-keiser-afs3-capabilities-00.txt</link>
    <description>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s.  AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture.  In 2003, new RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 that provide for capability querying between file servers and cache managers.  This memo provides a formal specification for that functionality, and provides analogous extensions to the volume server RPC interface.  Internet Draft Comments  Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.  AFS-3 Document State  This document is in state "draft", as per the document state definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].</description>
