    <title>"Peer-to-Peer Connections for the QUIC Transport Protocol", Colin Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-perkins-quic-p2p-mux-00.txt</link>
    <description>The QUIC transport protocol is intended to be a general purpose transport, but is currently defined for client-server operation only. To be applicable to all use cases, it needs to develop support for peer-to-peer connection establishment.  This memo describes how this can be done, in outline form.  Future work is needed to determine if such peer-to-peer use of QUIC is desirable and, if so, to define a complete and workable standard for peer-to-peer QUIC connection establishment.</description>
