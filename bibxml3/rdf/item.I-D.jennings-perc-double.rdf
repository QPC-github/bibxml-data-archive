    <description>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees.  This document defines SRTP procedures that use two separate but related cryptographic contexts to provide "hop-by-hop" and "end-to-end" security guarantees.  Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic transforms can utilize an authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties.</description>
