    <title>"Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Partial Response", Mario Loffredo, Maurizio Martinelli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-loffredo-regext-rdap-partial-response-03.txt</link>
    <description>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include capabilities to request partial responses.  In fact, according to the user authorization, the server can only return full responses. Partial responses capability, especially in the case of search queries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers.  This document describes a RDAP query extension that allows clients to specify their preference for obtaining a partial response.</description>
