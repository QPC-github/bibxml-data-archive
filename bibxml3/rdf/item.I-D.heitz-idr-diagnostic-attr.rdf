    <description>A BGP path attribute for the purpose of network diagnostics is described.  It is non-transitive, such that BGP speakers will not forward it by default.  It is structured as a list of elements.  An element begins with the BGP identifier and AS number of the speaker that appends the element and includes a list of TLVs.  Any speaker can add or remove an element to/from the list.  TLVs for a timestamp and for a checksum are described.</description>
