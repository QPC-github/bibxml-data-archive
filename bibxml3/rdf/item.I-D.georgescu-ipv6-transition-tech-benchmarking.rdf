    <description>There are benchmarking methodologies addressing the performance of network interconnect devices which are IPv4 or IPv6-capable. However, the IPv6 transition technologies are outside of their scope. This document provides complementary guidelines for evaluating the performance of IPv6 transition technologies.  The methodology also includes a tentative metric for benchmarking scalability.</description>
