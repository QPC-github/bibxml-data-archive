    <title>"Mandatory Use of Control Word for PWE3 Encapsulations", Nick Del Regno, Thomas Nadeau, Vishwas Manral, David Ward</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-delregno-pwe3-mandatory-control-word-00.txt</link>
    <description>Of the many variations of PWE3 Encapsulations and Modes (e.g. Ethernet, Port Mode, VLAN Mode, etc), only five have the Control Word (CW) as being optional.  As a result, this causes an issue with VCCV Control Channel selection.  This draft endeavors to resolve the issue going forward by making the Control Word, and subsequently the CW- based VCCV Control Channel, mandatory for all PWE3 Encapsulations.</description>
