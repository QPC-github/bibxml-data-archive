    <title>"Unicast Router Key Management Protocol (RKMP)", Dacheng Zhang, Sam Hartman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-karp-rkmp-00.txt</link>
    <description>When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two routers need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion. In order to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography, a secret key needs to be established.  This document defines a Router Key Management Protocol (RKMP) for establishing and managing such keys for routing protocols.</description>
