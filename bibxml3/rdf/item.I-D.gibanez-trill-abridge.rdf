    <title>"ABridges as RBridges: Transparent Routing with Simplified Multiple Spanning  Trees.", Guillermo Ibanez</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gibanez-trill-abridge-01.txt</link>
    <description>RBridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as a control plane but do not target to scale up to large campus networks. This document contains an alternative proposal to link-state RBridges, named ABridges. ABridges overcome RBridges L2 network size restrictions allowing applicability to very large Ethernet campus networks while maintaining zero configuration and high performance, by assuming a topological restriction that is automatically performed. The proposal includes a two-layered network architecture with two hierarchical independent spanning tree layers. Expected convergence is fast, probably below two seconds.</description>
