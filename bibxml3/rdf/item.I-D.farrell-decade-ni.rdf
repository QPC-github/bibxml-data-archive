    <description>This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in this case) using the output from a hash function, specifying a new URI scheme for this, a way to map those to http URLs, and binary and human "speakable" formats for these names.  The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it.  This work is motivated as a way to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols.</description>
