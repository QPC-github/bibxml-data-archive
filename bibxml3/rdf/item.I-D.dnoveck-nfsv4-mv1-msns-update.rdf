    <title>"NFSv4.1 Update for Multi-Server Namespace", David Noveck, Chuck Lever</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dnoveck-nfsv4-mv1-msns-update-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents necessary clarifications and corrections concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes in NFSv4.1.  These include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control of the set of network addresses to use to access a file system.  This document updates RFC5661.</description>
