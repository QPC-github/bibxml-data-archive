    <description>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can carry any data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision new service with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications such as Voice and Video are running on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in packet transmission and delivery. So Voice and Video traffic on MPLS network needs low loss and delay LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets. This draft is proposing a solution to selection of Low loss and latency LSP's for Voice and Video applications using MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters.   The benefit of this technology results in delivery voice and video packets with best possible lsp i.e. LSP's with less loss and delay.</description>
