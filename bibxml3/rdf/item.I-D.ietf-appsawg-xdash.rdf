    <title>"Deprecating the X- Prefix and Similar Constructs in Application Protocols", Peter Saint-Andre, Dave Crocker, Mark Nottingham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-appsawg-xdash-05.txt</link>
    <description>Historically, designers and implementers of application protocols have often distinguished between standardized and unstandardized parameters by prefixing the names of unstandardized parameters with the string "X-" or similar constructs.  In practice, that convention causes more problems than it solves.  Therefore, this document deprecates the convention for newly-defined parameters with textual (as opposed to numerical) names in application protocols.</description>
