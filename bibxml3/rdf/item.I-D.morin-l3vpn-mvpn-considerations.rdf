    <description>The current proposal for multicast in BGP/MPLS includes multiple alternative mechanisms for some of the required building blocks of the solution.  The aim of this document is to leverage previously documented requirements to identify the key elements and help move forward solution design, toward the definition of a standard having a well defined set of mandatory procedures.  The different proposed alternative mechanisms are examined in the light of requirements identified for multicast in L3VPNs, and suggestions are made about which of these mechanisms standardization should favor.  Issues related to existing deployments of early implementations are also addressed.</description>
