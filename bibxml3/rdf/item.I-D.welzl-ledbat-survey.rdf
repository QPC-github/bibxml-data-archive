    <title>"A Survey of Lower-than-Best Effort Transport Protocols", Michael Welzl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-welzl-ledbat-survey-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a survey of transport protocols which are designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used for low-priority "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a "less than" (or "lower than") best effort service.</description>
