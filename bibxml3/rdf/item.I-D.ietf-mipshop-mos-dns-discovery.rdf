    <title>"Locating IEEE 802.21 Mobility Servers using DNS", Gabor Bajko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mipshop-mos-dns-discovery-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines application service tags that allow service location without relying on rigid domain naming conventions, and DNS procedures for discovering servers which provide IEEE 802.21 [IEEE802.21] defined Mobility Services. Such Mobility Services are used to assist a Mobile Node (MN) supporting IEEE 802.21 [IEEE802.21], in handover preparation (network discovery) and    handover decision (network selection). The services addressed by this document are the Media Independent Handover Services defined in [IEEE802.21].</description>
