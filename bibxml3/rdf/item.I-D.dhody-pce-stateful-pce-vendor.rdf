        <description>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and the pending path computation requests.  This information may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for the associated and the dependent LSPs, received from a Path Computation Client (PCC).  RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).  This document extends this capability for the Stateful PCEP messages.</description>
