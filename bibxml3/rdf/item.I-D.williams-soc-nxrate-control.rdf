    <title>"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Non-eXempt Rate Control", Philip Williams</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-williams-soc-nxrate-control-00.txt</link>
    <description>A SIP overload control signalling protocol framework has previously been published, with the flexibility to allow different SIP request rate limiting algorithms to be selected. This document proposes a similar algorithm of maximum rate type with two advantages over existing proposals. Firstly, it exempts certain classes of SIP requests that are fundamental to correct operation of the SIP protocol which, if rejected by control, would worsen rather than improve SIP performance. Secondly, it allows target servers to control SIP traffic from sources not compliant with this document so that it can be deployed in heterogeneous network environments.</description>
