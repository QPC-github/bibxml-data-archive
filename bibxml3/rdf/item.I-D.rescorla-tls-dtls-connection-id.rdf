    <description>This document specifies the "Connection ID" concept for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, version 1.2 and version 1.3.  A Connection ID is an identifier carried in the record layer header that gives the recipient additional information for selecting the appropriate security association.  In "classical" DTLS, selecting a security association of an incoming DTLS record is accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple.  If the source IP address and/or source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing DTLS session then the receiver will be unable to locate the correct security context.</description>
