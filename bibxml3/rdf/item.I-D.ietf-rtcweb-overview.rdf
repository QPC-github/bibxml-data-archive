    <title>"Overview: Real Time Protocols for Browser-based Applications", Harald Alvestrand</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rtcweb-overview-19.txt</link>
    <description>This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers - "real time communication on the Web".  It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully specified and on the right publication track.  This document is an Applicability Statement - it does not itself specify any protocol, but specifies which other specifications WebRTC compliant implementations are supposed to follow.  This document is a work item of the RTCWEB working group.</description>
