    <title>"AODV Extensions for Multipath Routing", Sanghyun Ahn</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ahn-manet-multipath-aodv-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how AODV [1] can be extended for the support of MANET multipath routing. In AODV, the route information is not avilable either at the source or at the destination. So, AODV is less appropriate in establishing multiple routes with more desirable properties, compared with DSR [2]. But, for the sake of reliability and load balancing, in this draft, we describe how we can extend AODV to establish multiple routes from the source to the destination.</description>
