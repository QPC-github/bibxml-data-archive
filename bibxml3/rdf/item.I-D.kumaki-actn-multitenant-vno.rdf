    <description>This document provides a use case that addresses the need for facilitating virtual network operation: creation and operation of multi-tenant virtual networks that use the common core network resources.  This will accelerate a rapid service deployment of new services, including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall network operations and scaling of existing services.  This use case addresses the aforementioned needs within a single operator network.</description>
