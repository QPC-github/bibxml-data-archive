    <description>Multi-homed networks based on IPv6 form an important architecture within the NEMO (NEtwork MObility) configurations. Mainly in these networks the Mobile Router (MR) can appear in the neighbourhood of several Access Routers (ARs). In this case, MR has several egress interfaces and can detect several ARs simultaneously. This draft introduces a protocol that achieves handoff and resource management in a NEMO network in the case of multi-homed MR. We called this protocol an HRMMN protocol (Handoff and Resource Management for Multi-homed Networks). We introduce into the NEMO architecture an intelligent control entity called Access Router Controller (ARC). Based on traffic information transmitted through several ARs under the control of specific ARC, this latter is responsible of taking decisions about handoff, resource management and maintain of multiple bidirectional tunnels.</description>
