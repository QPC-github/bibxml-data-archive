    <title>"Thoughts on Naming and Referencing of Data Objects within Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) solutions", Ben Niven-Jenkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jenkins-cdni-names-00.txt</link>
    <description>As part of the development of protocols and solutions for CDNI it will be necessary to agree on common mechanisms for how to identify and name the data objects that are to be interchanged between interconnected CDNs, as well as how to describe which policy should be used when doing so.  This document presents some thoughts on the naming and referencing of data types/objects within a CDNI solution.</description>
