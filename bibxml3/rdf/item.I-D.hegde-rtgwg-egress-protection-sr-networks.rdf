        <description>This document specifies a Fast Reroute(FRR) mechanism for protecting IP/MPLS services that use Segment Routing (SR) paths for transport against egress node and egress link failures.  The mechanism is based on egress protection framework described in [RFC8679].  The egress protection mechanism can be further simplified in Segment Routing networks with anycast SIDs and anycast Locators.  This document addresses all kinds of networks that use Segment Routing transport such as SR-MPLS over IPv4, SR-MPLS over IPv6, SRv6 and SRm6.</description>
