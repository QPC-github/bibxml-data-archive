    <title>"Requirements of distributed mobility management", Anthony Chan</title>

    <description>The traditional hierarchical structure of cellular networks has led to deployment models which are heavily centralized.  Mobility management with centralized mobility anchoring in existing hierarchical mobile networks is quite prone to suboptimal routing and issues related to scalability.  Centralized functions present a single point of failure, and inevitably introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network operations related to mobility management.  This document defines the requirements for distributed mobility management for IPv6 deployment.  The objectives are to match the mobility deployment with the current trend in network evolution, to improve scalability, to avoid single point of failure, to enable transparency to upper layers only when needed, etc.  The distributed mobility management also needs to be compatible with existing network deployments and end hosts, and be secured.</description>
