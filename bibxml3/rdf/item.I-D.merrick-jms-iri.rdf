    <title>"IRI Scheme for Java(tm) Message Service 1.0", Debao Xiao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-merrick-jms-iri-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the format of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) as defined in [RFC3987], for designating connections and destination addresses used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS) [REF-JMS]. It was originally designed for particular uses, but should have general applicability wherever a JMS IRI is needed to describe the connection to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS destination. The syntax of 'jms' IRIs is not compatible with any known current vendor implementation, but the expressivity of the format should permit all vendors to use it.</description>
