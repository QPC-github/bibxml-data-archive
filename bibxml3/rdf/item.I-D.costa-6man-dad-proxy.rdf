    <description>The document describes a mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to-multipoint architecture with "split-horizon" forwarding scheme.  Based on the DAD signalling, the first hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point-to-multipoint domain (e.g. VLAN).  When a node performs DAD for an address already used by another node, the first hop router replies instead of this last one.</description>
