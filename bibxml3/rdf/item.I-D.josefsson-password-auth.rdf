    <title>"A Password-based Authentication Protocol", Simon Josefsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-josefsson-password-auth-00.txt</link>
    <description>There is a lack of a simple, standardized, secure and modern password-based mechanism for user authentication in application protocols. This document specify a challenge/response protocol that provide password-based authentication services. We describe how the protocol may be used as a GSS-API mechanism and, using the GS2 framework, how it may be used as a SASL mechanism. The protocol supports HMAC-SHA-256 as the mandatory to implement algorithm, and it supports channel bindings. The intended use is by application protocol that today use CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5 via SASL, or by GSS- API applications that needs a password based method. The protocol is applicable to other environments, such as EAP, should the need arise. See &lt;http://josefsson.org/password/> for more information.</description>
