    <title>"Publishing Organization Boundaries in the DNS", John Levine</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levine-orgboundary-04.txt</link>

Rather than describing a particular design, we describe an architecture to publish in the DNS the boundaries between organizations that can be adapted to various policy models.</description>
