        <description>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a transport for HTTP, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and low-latency connection establishment.  This document describes a mapping of HTTP semantics over QUIC.  This document also identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how HTTP/2 extensions can be ported to HTTP/3.  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF HTTP  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF HTTP/3 UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This version is still a work in progress.  For trial deployments, please use earlier versions.
