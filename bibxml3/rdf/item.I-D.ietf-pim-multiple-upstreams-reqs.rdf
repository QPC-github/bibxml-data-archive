    <title>"Requirements for the extension of the IGMP/MLD proxy functionality to support multiple upstream interfaces", Luis Contreras, Carlos Bernardos, Hitoshi Asaeda, Nicolai Leymann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pim-multiple-upstreams-reqs-08.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a MLD (for IPv6) or IGMP (for IPv4) proxy with multiple interfaces covering a variety of applicability scenarios.  The referred scenarios, while describing not sophisticated service situations, present cases that existing technology does not allow to solve in a simplistic manner. This document is then intended to serve as input for future documents defining the support of multiple upstream interfaces by IGMP/MLD proxies being compliant with the aforementioned requirements.</description>
