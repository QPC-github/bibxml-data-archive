    <title>"Use of ARP and Flood Routing Technique for LSP setup in ECPN", Jaihyung Cho</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jaihyung-ccamp-arpsignal-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this memo, we first discuss some weaknesses of proposals employing RSVP in local network, such as RFC2814, 2815, 2816, and propose extension of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and [LSE] technique for solution to provide QoS in Ethernet based Customer Premise Network (ECPN). Framework architecture of LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) as a method of GMPLS implementation for Ethernet is described in [LSE]. ARP is proposed for integrated signaling and routing protocol in ECPN. This document describes overview of ARP extension, procedure for label negotiation and method for QoS routing. Major features of this ARP extension are; support for label switching, incorporation of routing function, compatibility with legacy Ethernet and enhanced security.</description>
