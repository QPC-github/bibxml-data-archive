    <title>"TCP Extensions for High Performance", David Borman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-borman-1323bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance over large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliable operation over very high-speed paths. It defines new TCP options for scaled windows and timestamps, which are designed to provide compatible interworking with TCP's that do not implement the extensions. The timestamps are used for two distinct mechanisms: RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequences). Selective acknowledgments are not included in this memo. This memo updates and obsoletes RFC-1323 [Jacobson92d].</description>
