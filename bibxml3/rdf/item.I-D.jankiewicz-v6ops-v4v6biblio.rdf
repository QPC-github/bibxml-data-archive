    <description>The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protracted period of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6.  Network operators are challenged with the task of activating IPv6 without negative impact on operating IPv4 networks and their customers.  This draft is an informational "annotated bibliography" compiled to help in the analysis and development of basic guidelines and recommendations for network operators.  The goal of this document is to survey the current state of RFCs, Internet-Drafts and external reference materials that define the use cases, problem statements, protocols, transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that will be of interest to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.</description>
