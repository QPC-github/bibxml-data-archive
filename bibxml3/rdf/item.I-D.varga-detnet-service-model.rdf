    <description>This document describes service model for scenarios requiring deterministic networking.  This new version 02 of the DetNet Service Model draft is primarily intended to prevent it from expiring.  Major parts of this document were moved to the architecture draft, but some remaining text is under discussion in the workgroup (e.g., QoS, etc.).</description>
