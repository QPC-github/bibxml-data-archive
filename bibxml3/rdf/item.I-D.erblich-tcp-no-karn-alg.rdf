    <description>Karn's algorithm specifies acknowledgements that are the result of segment retransmits should be ignored, not timed, and should not contribute to the smoothed round-trip-time (SRTT) because they are considered "ambiguous". It is also stated in Karn's paper that "If an acknowledgement arrives after the RTO has expired, it is highly likely to come very shortly after wards." In time, we have added the "fast retransmit" functionality, so we are not solely dependent on RTO for retransmits. Common sense dictates that if we receive an acknowledgement "very shortly after wards", that those acknowledgments should not be considered "ambiguous". These non-ambiguous acknowledgments should be added to the SRTT and trigger us to return to our previous non-congestion behavior.</description>
