    <description>Rbridges are transparent Layer 2 bridges that provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple physical links look like a single subnet. The Rbridge technology utilizes Rbridges to link together Layer 2 areas using spanning trees to calculate paths. The Rbridges run a link state protocol to determine the least cost paths Rbridges and exchange information about the location of MAC addresses. The Rbridges will run a level 1 or a single area routing protocol. To forward multicast packets, the Rbirdges may treat these as broadcast (sending the packets to all Rbridges) or use methods to snoop the Multicast MAC addresses (GARP, MAC learning) or IP/MAC address packets (IGMP/PIM snooping). Multicast Link State Rbridge connections suggest a Hybrid Multicast Link state extensions to ISIS and OSPF for Rbridges.</description>
