    <title>"A Protocol for Network-based Localized Mobility Management", Anand Bedekar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-singh-netlmm-protocol-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document suggests a localized mobility solution controlled by the network within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution is based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIP) technique and employs a PMIP client that generates a Proxy Binding Update message. The solution allows for a clean separation between the bearer and signaling paths, and reuse of MIPv6 home agent as the local mobility anchor. The security association between the network elements for executing the local mobility is also discussed.</description>
