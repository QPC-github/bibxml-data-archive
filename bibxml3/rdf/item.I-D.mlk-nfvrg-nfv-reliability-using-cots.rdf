    <description>This draft discusses the results of a recent study on the feasibility of using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware for virtualized network functions in telecom equipment.  In particular, it explores the conditions under which the COTS hardware can be used in the NFV (Network Function Virtualization) environment.  The concept of silent error probability is introduced in order to take software error or undetectable hardware failures into account.  The silent error probability is included in both the theoretical work and the simulation work.  It is difficult to theoretically analyze the impact of site maintenance and site failure events.  Therefore, simulation is used for evaluating the impact of these site management related events which constitute the undesirable feature of using COTS hardware in telecom environment.</description>
