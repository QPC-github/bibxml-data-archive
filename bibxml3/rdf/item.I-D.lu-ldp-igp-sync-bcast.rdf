    <title>"LDP IGP Synchronization for broadcast networks", Wenhu Lu, Sriganesh Kini</title>

    <description>[LDP-IGP-SYNC] describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic (e.g. VPN) when IGP is operational on a link but LDP is not. If this mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP/IGP peer, the cost-out procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not an individual peer. When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network. This document describes a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The mechanism does not introduce any protocol changes.</description>
