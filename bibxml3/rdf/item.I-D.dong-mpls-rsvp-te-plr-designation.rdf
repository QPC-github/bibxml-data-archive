    <description>This document defines RSVP-TE extensions which enable the ingress node to designate particular LSRs along the path as Points of Local Repair (PLRs) of the protected LSP, and further indicate the protection type of each PLR. These mechanisms could enhance the control over the establishment of backup LSPs, achieve more flexible TE FRR and also could save the resources needed for establishing and maintaining unnecessary backup LSPs.</description>
