    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-pwe3-802-1ah-00.txt</link>
    <description>Ethernet has been widely deployed in metro-networks, and there are more and more customers select Ethernet PW services. With the deployment of IEEE 802.1ah network, there is a need to support 802.1ah attachment circuit. Based on the two modes defined in RFC 4448, this document introduces a new Ethernet encapsulation mode to support the new AC type. This document also describes some scenarios and procedures pertaining to the new mode. Some considerations relating to multi-segment PW are also discussed.</description>
