    <title>"DHCPv4 Extensions and Option for Fast Handovers", Takeshi Ogawa</title>

    <description>When a standard IPv4 node (mobile node: MN) changes its wireless network attachment point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer configuration information (e.g., its new IP address and the addresses of new routers) from a DHCP server and changes its IP layer configuration. During such a handover process, it cannot send or receive IP packets to/from its corresponding node (CN), so a service disruption is caused. In this document, we introduce new DHCPv4 extensions and an option (Fast Handover Option) for fast handovers. This protocol is ported from "DHCPv6 options for Fast Handovers" [6]. It enables DHCP servers to send new configuration information to MNs before a handover to be used after the handover, so MNs can have shorter handover processing times. It is noted that DHCP servers and MNs implementing this protocol can achieve fast handovers with standard IPv4 routers without any other micro-mobility management protocols.</description>
