    <title>"Current Hostname Practice Considered Harmful", Christian Huitema, Dave Thaler, Rolf Winter</title>

This document describes some of the protocols that reveal hostnames today and sketches another possible remedy, which is to replace static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.</description>
