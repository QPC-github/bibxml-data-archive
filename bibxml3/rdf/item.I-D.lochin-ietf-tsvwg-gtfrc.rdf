    <title>"Guaranteed TCP Friendly Rate Control (gTFRC) for DiffServ/AF Network", Emmanuel Lochin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lochin-ietf-tsvwg-gtfrc-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo introduces gTFRC, a TCP-Friendly Rate Control providing throughput guarantee over the DiffServ/AF class. gTFRC is largely based on TFRC [2]. It provides a mean to take into account the quality of service negotiated with the network. As a result, the mechanism is able to reach a minimum throughput guarantee whatever the flow's RTT and target rate.</description>
