    <title>"Requirements for handling abandoned calls and premature disconnects in  emergency calls on the Internet", Brian Rosen</title>

    <description>The -phonebcp draft currently requires endpoints to disable sending a BYE on an emergency call.  Insufficient justification and lack of attention to the entire problem has caused comment on that section of the document.  This document attempts to define the problem and the requirements to controlling disconnect on emergency calls.</description>
