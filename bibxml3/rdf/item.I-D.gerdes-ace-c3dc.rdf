    <title>"C3DC -- Constrained Client/Cross-Domain Capable Authorization Profile for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE)", Stefanie Gerdes, Olaf Bergmann, Carsten Bormann</title>

    <description>Resource-constrained nodes come in various sizes and shapes and often have constraints on code size, state memory, processing capabilities, user interface, power and communication bandwidth (RFC 7228).  This document specifies a profile that describes how two autonomous resource-constrained devices, a client and a server, obtain the required keying material and authorization information to securely communicate with each other.  Each of the devices is coupled with a less-constrained device, the authorization manager, that helps with difficult authentication and authorization tasks.  The constrained devices do not need to register with authorization managers from other security domains.  The profile specifically targets constrained clients and servers.  It is designed to consider the security objectives of the owners on the server and the client side.</description>
