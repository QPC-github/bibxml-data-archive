    <title>"Guidance for AAA Key Management", Russ Housley, Bernard Aboba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-housley-aaa-key-mgmt-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides guidance to designers of AAA key management protocols. The guidance is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key management protocols. Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure, long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field, it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) protocols. The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication as IETF RFCs. Further, these guidelines will be useful to other standards development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management.</description>
