        <description>Generalized SRv6 network programming defines the enhanced mechanisms of SRv6 to encode SRv6 SIDs, Compressed SIDs and even the MPLS labels or IPv4 tunnel information in a single SRH.  This type of SRH is called Generalized SRH (G-SRH), which can reduce the overhead of SRv6 and also provide more flexibility for network programming.  This document defines the encapsulation and packet processing of G-SRH.</description>
