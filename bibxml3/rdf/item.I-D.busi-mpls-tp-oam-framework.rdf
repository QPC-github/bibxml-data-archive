    <description>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of a control plane.  This document provides a framework that supports a comprehensive set of OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [11].</description>
