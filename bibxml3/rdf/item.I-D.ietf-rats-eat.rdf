        <description>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides an attested claims set that describes state and characteristics of an entity, a device like a phone, IoT device, network equipment or such.  This claims set is used by a relying party, server or service to determine how much it wishes to trust the entity.  An EAT is either a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented claims.  To a large degree, all this document does is extend CWT and JWT.</description>
