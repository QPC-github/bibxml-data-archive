    <description>This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular networks.  An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) mechanism are established for both operation efficiency and the saving of wireless bandwidth and vehicle energy. Also, the two new ND options for a rapid prefix and service discovery are used to announce the network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's internal network).  Finally, a mobility management scheme is proposed for moving vehicles in vehicular environments to support seamless communication for the continuity of transport-layer sessions (e.g., TCP connections).</description>
