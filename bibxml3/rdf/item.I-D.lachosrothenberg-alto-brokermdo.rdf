    <title>"ALTO-based Broker-assisted Multi-domain Orchestration", Danny Perez, Christian Rothenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lachosrothenberg-alto-brokermdo-04.txt</link>
    <description>Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) demand new multiple administrative domain (aka multi-domain) orchestration models.  This document proposes a new broker-plane approach working on top of per- domain management and orchestration functions to coordinate the delivery of a multi-operator End-to-End Network Service (E2ENS). This proposed design resorts to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol to offer topology and resource information from different administrative domains.  The ALTO services with the proposed protocol extension offer aggregated views on various types of resources contributing to a more simple and scalable solution.</description>
