    <title>"ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF protocols", Yoav Nir, Adam Langley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nir-cfrg-chacha20-poly1305-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher, as well as the use of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms, and as a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm.  This document does not introduce any new crypto, but is meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide.</description>
