        <description>RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint security. Yet increasingly protocol development is making assumptions about endpoint security capabilities which have not been defined. RFC 3552 is 17 years old and threat landscape has changed. Security issues and cyber attacks have increased and there are more devices, users, and applications on the endpoint than ever. This draft proposes a new approach to the Internet threat model which will include endpoint security, focus on users and provide an update to the threat model in RFC 3552. It brings together Security Considerations for Protocol Designers draft-lazanski-protocol-sec-design-model-t-01 which is a comprehensive document that lists threats, attack vectors, examples and considerations for designing protocols, as well as draft-taddei-smart- cless-introduction-02 which lays out security concerns, capabilities and limitations for endpoints in general and draft-mcfadden-smart- endpoint-taxonomy-for-cless-01 which outlines a clear taxonomy for endpoint security and identifies changes in technology, economic and protocol development that has impacted and changed endpoint security. Taken together these drafts reflect a comprehensive and clear set of security threats and design considerations for the Internet.</description>
