    <description>This document specifies a method for optional flow control credit scaling and link quality metric scaling for Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPPoE).  Credit and metric scaling is required when connecting to high performance devices that employ the PPPoE credit flow control and link metric reports as defined in RFC 4938.</description>
