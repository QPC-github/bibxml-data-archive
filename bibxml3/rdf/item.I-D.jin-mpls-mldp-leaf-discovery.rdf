    <description>This document describes a mechanism for a root node to discover the leaf nodes of an mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP.  Such kind of function could be used for multiplexing/aggregating root initiated and leaf initiated application which will use mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP. Examples of root initiated applications are P2MP PW [I-D.ietf-pwe3-p2mp-pw], VPLS multicast [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-mcast], L3VPN multicast [RFC6513].  And examples of leaf initiated applications are statically configured mLDP based P2MP/MP2MP LSP, mLDP in-band signaling [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling].</description>
