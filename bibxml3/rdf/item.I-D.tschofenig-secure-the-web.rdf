    <description>The year 2011 has been quite exciting from a Web security point of view: a number of high-profile security incidents have gotten a lot of press attention but also new initiatives, such as the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), had been launched to improve the Web identity eco-system.  The NSTIC strategy paper, for example, observes problems with Internet security due to the widespread usage of low-entropy passwords and the lack of widely deployed authentication and attribute assurance services.  With this memorandum we try to develop a shared vision for how to deal with the most pressing Web security problems.</description>
