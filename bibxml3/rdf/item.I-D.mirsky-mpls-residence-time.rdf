    <description>This document specifies G-ACh based Residence Time Measurement and how it can be used by time synchronization protocols being transported over MPLS domain.  Residence time is the variable part of propagation delay of timing and synchronization messages and knowing what this delay is for each message allows for a more accurate determination of the delay to be taken into account in applying the value included in a PTP event message.</description>
