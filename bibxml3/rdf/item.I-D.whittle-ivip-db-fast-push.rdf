    <description>draft-whittle-ivip-db-fast-push-03 was relevant to Ivip before the introduction (2010-02-26) of Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM). While these techniques might be of interest for other purposes, they are no longer part of Ivip.  This -04 version is simply a notice to this effect.  Please see draft-whittle-ivip-drtm.</description>
