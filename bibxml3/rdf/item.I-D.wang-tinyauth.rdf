    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-tinyauth-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies basic security standards for authentication protocol on Ad hoc. The security standards are based on the ECDH to discover a authentication protocol between two nodes, and on the TinyOS simulation platform and Mica nodes. This document also defines elements of procedure for authentication protocol, including System Initialization, Key extract and the identity authentication. With these standards, authentication between two nodes can be completed in a certain time and a certain circles.</description>
