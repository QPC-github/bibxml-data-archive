    <description>As more experience of deploying SIMPLE based presence systems is accumulated, it seems that deploying a large SIMPLE presence system is actually a very hard task. The document analyzes several aspects of SIMPLE based presence system deployment and shows that difficulties around the amount of messages (network), state management (memory) and processing load (cpu). Although this document is a problem statement document and not a BCP document, several possible optimizations and directions are listed at the end of the document in addition to an initial set of requirements for what should be the characteristic of the solution to the problem stated in the document This document is intended to be used by the SIMPLE WG in order to work on possible solutions that will make the deployment of a presence server more reasonable task. Note that the document does not try to compare the SIP based presence server to other types of presence servers but only analyzes the SIP based presence server.</description>
