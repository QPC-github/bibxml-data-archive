    <title>"ASCII Escaping of Unicode Characters", John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klensin-unicode-escapes-07.txt</link>
    <description>There are a number of circumstances in which an escape mechanism is needed in conjunction with a protocol to encode characters that cannot be represented or transmitted directly.  With ASCII coding the traditional escape has been either the decimal or hexadecimal numeric value of the character, written in a variety of different ways.  The move to Unicode, where characters occupy two or more octets and may be coded in several different forms, has further complicated the question of escapes.  This document discusses some options now in use and discusses considerations for selecting one for use in new IETF protocols and protocols that are now being internationalized.</description>
