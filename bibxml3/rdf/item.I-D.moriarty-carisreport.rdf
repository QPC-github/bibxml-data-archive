    <description>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Society (ISOC) hosted a day-long Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) workshop on 18 June 2015 in coordination with the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) Conference in Berlin. The workshop included members of the FIRST community, attack response working group representatives, network and security operators, Regional Internet Registry (RIR) representatives, researchers, vendors, and representatives from standardisation communities.  Key goals of the workshop were to improve mutual awareness, understanding, and coordination among the diverse participating organizations and their representatives.  The workshop also aimed to provide the attendees with greater awareness of existing efforts to mitigate specific types of attacks, and greater understanding of the options available to collaborate and engage with these efforts.</description>
