    <description>The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate local desktop and remote computing/storage resources, which was initially derived from the remote desktop administration but with new business models and very different use cases.  Most of existing VDI systems are based on proprietary implementation, and positioning different market with different features.  Since virtual desktop technology is believed to be a mainstream application delivery method, like http protocol against web applications, so it's important to make the virtual desktop access protocol open and standard.  This draft summarizes the limitations of existing virtual desktop systems, and proposes the intent standardization work in IETF.</description>
