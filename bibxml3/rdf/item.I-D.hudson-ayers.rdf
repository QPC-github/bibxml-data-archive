    <title>"Design Considerations For Low Power Internet Protocols", Hudson Ayers, Paul Crews, Hubert Teo, Conor McAvity, Amit Levy, Philip Levis</title>

    <description>This document discusses guidelines for specifying low-power Internet protocols in order to improve implementation interoperability. These guidelines are based around the importance of balancing memory usage and energy efficiency, and the importance of not relying on Postel's law when dealing with low resource devices. This document applies these guidelines to the IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) Internet Standard, suggesting changes that would make it more likely for implementations to interoperate.</description>
