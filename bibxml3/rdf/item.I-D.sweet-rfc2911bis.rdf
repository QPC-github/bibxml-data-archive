    <title>"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics", Michael Sweet, Ira McDonald</title>

    <description>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations that is independent of encoding and transport.  The model consists of several objects including Printers and Jobs.  Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.  IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities, submit print Jobs, inquire about the status of print Jobs and Printers, and cancel, hold, and release print Jobs.  IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.  Security, internationalization, and directory issues are also addressed by the model and semantics.  The IPP message encoding and transport are described in IPP/1.1: Encoding and Transport [RFC2910bis].  This document obsoletes RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.</description>
