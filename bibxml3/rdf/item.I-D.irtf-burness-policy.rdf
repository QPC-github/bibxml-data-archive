    <description>When considering a new routing system, we need to ensure that it is able to meet the functionality requirements of the participant networks.  One aspect that is frequently over-looked is that routing is rarely a simple matter of choosing a least-hop path.  This document attempts to highlight some of the more common policy choices that are made.  We expect that policies that are in common use today should be easy to implement with any new routing schemes.  Any routing scheme make it possible or significantly easier to implement the harder policies would have an implementation advantage.</description>
