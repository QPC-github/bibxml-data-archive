    <title>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP", Francois Audet, Cullen  Jennings</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-behave-nat-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types of behavior for NATs when handling unicast UDP. It also defines a set of requirements for NATs that would allow many applications, such as multimedia communications or online gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications will function properly.</description>
