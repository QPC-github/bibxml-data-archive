    <description>This document discusses the need and the mechanisms to dynamically update configuration of network monitoring devices to help identify distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in a network.  Once an attack is signalled by a client or detected locally, provisioning cycles are triggered to program a set of network elements to undertake appropriate actions (including, blackhole, drop, rate- limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic.</description>
