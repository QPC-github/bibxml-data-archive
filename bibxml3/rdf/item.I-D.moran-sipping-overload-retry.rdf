    <title>"Determining When to Discard or Retry a SIP Request During Overload", Timothy  Moran</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moran-sipping-overload-retry-00.txt</link>
    <description>SIP servers can become overload and unable to handle all SIP messages they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This document proposes an architecture for determining when a client should throttle the sending of SIP requests vs. retrying them.</description>
