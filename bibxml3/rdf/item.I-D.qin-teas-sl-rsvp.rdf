    <description>RSVP takes a "soft state" scheme to manage the reservation states in routers and hosts, the soft states are created and periodically refreshed by Path and Resv messages.  Soft state scheme gives a simple way to maintain the state synchonization between neighbors, but also introduces scalability issue.  This document provides a framework that describes and discusses the architecture for stateless RSVP (SL-RSVP), which disabled the soft-state scheme to improve the protocol scalability and the other processes of RSVP are kept.  This document does not describe specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize this architecture.</description>
