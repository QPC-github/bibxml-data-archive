    <description>One of the goals of autonomic networking is to simplify the management of networks by human operators.  Intent Based Networking (IBN) is a possible approach to realize this goal.  With IBN, the operator indicates to the network what to do (i.e. her intent) and not how to do it.  In the field of Policy Based Management (PBM), the concept of intent is called a declarative policy.  This document proposes a refinement of the intent concept initially defined in [RFC7575] for autonomic networks by providing a more complete definition, a life-cycle, some use cases and a tentative format of the ANIMA Intent Policy.</description>
