    <title>"Mobile Communication Congestion Exposure Scenario", Dirk Kutscher, Faisal Mir, Rolf Winter, Suresh Krishnan, Carlos Bernardos</title>

    <description>This memo describes a mobile communications use case for congestion exposure (CONEX) with a particular focus on mobile communication networks such as 3GPP EPS.  The draft describes the architecture of these networks (access and core networks), current QoS mechanisms and then discusses how congestion exposure concepts could be applied. Based on this, this memo suggests a set of requirements for CONEX mechanisms that particularly apply to mobile networks.</description>
