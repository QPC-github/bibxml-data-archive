    <title>"PCN 3-State Encoding Extension in a single DSCP", Bob Briscoe</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-briscoe-pcn-3-in-1-encoding-00.txt</link>
    <description>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect the quality of service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate.  This document specifies an extension to the two-state PCN baseline encoding that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IP header without using more than one Diffserv codepoint.  It presupposes a standards action has removed the limit of two encoding states in current tunnelling mechanisms.</description>
