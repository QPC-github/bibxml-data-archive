    <title>"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv4 (DNAv4)", Bernard Aboba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-18.txt</link>
    <description>The time required to detect movement between networks, and to obtain (or continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a fraction of the total handover latency in moving between points of attachment. This document synthesizes from experience in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP, and IPv4 Link-Local addresses a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving between points of attachment.</description>
