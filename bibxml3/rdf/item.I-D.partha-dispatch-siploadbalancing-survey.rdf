    <description>SIP Load balancing across a farm of SIP servers can be done today, but without generally agreed upon principles on how to best do accomplish this.  Confounding the problem is that a SIP farm may consist of hosts with varying capabilities, example, a SIP proxy, a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA), a public-switched telephone system (PSTN) gateway, SIP Media servers etc.  The capabilities and processing capacity on hosts in the farm may be different, sometimes vastly, from each other.  This document present the survey of existing literature and common practice on SIP load balancing.</description>
