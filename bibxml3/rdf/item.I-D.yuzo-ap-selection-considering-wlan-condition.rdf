    <description>This document discusses AP selection method utilizing the number of frame retransmissions in addition to received signal strength (RSSI). In a real environment, WLANs are congested by lots of mobile nodes, and sometimes influenced by other WLAN devices. They result in deterioration of communication quality. In such environment, each mobile node has to select an AP with better performance for keeping its own communication stable. To enable this, we employ the number of frame retransmissions and RSSI as selection indexes. We then describe an architecture design and implementation for our proposed scheme.</description>
