    <description>In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the P2P-RPL protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This mechanism allows sensor nodes to send packets over the backup path without rediscovering the p2p path in case of path failure, thus improving the reliability of p2p transmission.</description>
