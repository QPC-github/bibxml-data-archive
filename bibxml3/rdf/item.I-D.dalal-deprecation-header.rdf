    <description>The HTTP Deprecation response header field can be used to signal to consumers of a URI-identified resource that the resource has been deprecated.  Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to link to a resource that provides additional context for the deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a replacement for the deprecated resource.</description>
