        <description>This document describes CPace which is a protocol for two parties that share a low-entropy secret (password) to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the secret to offline dictionary attacks. This method was tailored for constrained devices, is compatible with any group of both prime- and non-prime order, and comes with a security proof providing composability guarantees.</description>
