    <title>"Deprecating Use of the "X-" Prefix in Application Protocols", Peter Saint-Andre, D. Crocker, Mark Nottingham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-xdash-03.txt</link>
    <description>Historically, there has often been a perceived distinction between "standard" and "non-standard" parameters (such as media types and header fields), by prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions (e.g., "x.").  In practice, this convention causes more problems than it solves. Therefore, this document deprecates the "X-" convention for most application protocol parameters.</description>
