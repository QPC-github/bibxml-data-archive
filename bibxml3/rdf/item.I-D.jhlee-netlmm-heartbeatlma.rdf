    <title>"Heartbeat Mechanism for Local Mobility Anchors in Proxy Mobile IPv6", Jong-Hyouk Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jhlee-netlmm-heartbeatlma-01.txt</link>
    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) introduces new mobility entities: the local mobility anchor (LMA) and the mobile access gateway (MAG).  The LMA and MAG manage bi-directional tunnels between themselves to provide a network-based mobility service to mobile nodes (MNs) within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain).  The failure of LMA connected with its MAGs causes the communication failure of MNs attached to the MAGs.  Thus, the early failure detection of LMA is desirable for appropriate countermeasures.  This document specifies a heartbeat mechanism for LMAs to detect the current reachability between the LMAs.</description>
