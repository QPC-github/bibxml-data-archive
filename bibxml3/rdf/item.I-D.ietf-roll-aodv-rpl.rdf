        <description>Route discovery for symmetric and asymmetric Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic flows is a desirable feature in Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  For that purpose, this document specifies a reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for both hop-by-hop routing and source routing: Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) based RPL protocol (AODV-RPL).  Paired Instances are used to construct directional paths, for cases where there are asymmetric links between source and target nodes.</description>
