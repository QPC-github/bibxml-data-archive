    <description>This document specifies method for verifying the connection of an MPLS Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for management purpose. The proposed extension is based on MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). The goal is to verify that an MPLS-TP LSP is properly setup in both control and data  planes, as well as to record the identities of all the LSRs along the path of MPLS-TP LSP.</description>
