    <title>"Thoughts about Digital Signatures for the Open Web Authentication (OAuth) Protocol", Hannes Tschofenig, Blaine Cook</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tschofenig-oauth-signature-thoughts-00.txt</link>
    <description>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth 1.0), often referred to as the community addition, included an mechanism for putting a digital signature (when using asymmetric keys) or a keyed message digest (when using symmetric keys) to a resource request when presenting the OAuth token.  This cryptographic mechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly about the problems implementers had, the use cases it supports, and the benefit-cost tradeoff.  This document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuth Signature' mechamism in an unbiased and less emotional way with the main purpose to conclude the discussions.</description>
