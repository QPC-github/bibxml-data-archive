    <title>"Securing RPSL Objects with RPKI Signatures", Robert Kisteleki, Brian Haberman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sidr-rpsl-sig-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a method to allow parties to electronically sign Routing Policy Specification Language objects and validate such electronic signatures.  This allows relying parties to detect accidental or malicious modifications on such objects.  It also allows parties who run Internet Routing Registries or similar databases, but do not yet have Routing Policy System Security-based authentication of the maintainers of certain objects, to verify that the additions or modifications of such database objects are done by the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources mentioned in those objects.  This document updates RFC 2622 and RFC 4012 to add the signature attribute to supported RPSL objects.</description>
