    <title>"The Hashed Token SASL Mechanism", Florian Schmaus, Christoph Egger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schmaus-kitten-sasl-ht-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms which enable a proof-of-possession-based authentication scheme and are meant to be used for quick re-authentication of a previous session.  The Hashed Token SASL mechanism's authentication sequence consists of only one round-trip.  The usage of short-lived, exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens is achieving the single round- trip property.  The SASL mechanism specified herin further provides hash agility, mutual authentication and is secured by channel binding.</description>
