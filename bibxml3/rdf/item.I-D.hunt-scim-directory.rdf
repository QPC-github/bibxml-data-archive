    <description>This document describes a directory server that implements the SCIM protocol and schema [, its capabilities and access control model], and optional support for LDAPv3 protocol.  This specification extends SCIM from provisioning to a general purpose access protocol in support of data management applications (e.g. self-service systems) and RESTful clients that need read/write access to a directory on the Internet, between domains, or within a cloud.</description>
