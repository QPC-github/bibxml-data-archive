    <title>"ForCES Protocol Extensions", Jamal Hadi Salim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-forces-protoextension-06.txt</link>
    <description>Experience in implementing and deploying ForCES architecture has demonstrated need for a few small extensions both to ease programmability and to improve wire efficiency of some transactions. The ForCES protocol is extended with a table range operation and a new extension for error handling.  This documents updates both RFC 5810 and RFC 7121 semantics to achieve that end goal.</description>
