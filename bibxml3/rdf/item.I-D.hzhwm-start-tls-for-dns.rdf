    <description>This document describes a technique for upgrading a DNS TCP connection to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) over standard ports. Encryption provided by DNS-over-TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping of DNS queries in the network.  The proposed mechanism is backwards compatible with clients and servers that are not aware of DNS-over-TLS.</description>
