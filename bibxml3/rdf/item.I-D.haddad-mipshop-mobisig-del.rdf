    <title>"Mobility Signaling Delegation", Wassim Haddad</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-haddad-mipshop-mobisig-del-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a mechanism which delegates the exchange of mobility signaling messages between the mobile and correspondent nodes to the network infrastructure. Goals outlining the proposed delegation are to further reduce the IP handoff latency and to relieve the mobile node from exchanging a considerable amount of signaling messages with correspondent nodes while retaining full control on the critical ones.</description>
