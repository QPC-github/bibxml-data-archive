    <description>The standardization of Real time communication between browsers is to provide the infrastructure for audio, video, text communication using standard interface so that interoperable communication can be established between any compatible browsers.  RTCWeb specific Javascript API will be provided by browsers for developing real-time web application.  It is possible to develop signaling protocol like Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Jingle or websocket extension or custom-made signaling protocol in Javascript.  There are lots of issues in Javascript based signaling protocol.  This document list the need for standard signaling protocol between RTCWeb client (browser) and RTCWeb server and possible signaling protocol for the same.</description>
