    <title>"A Generic IPv6 Addresses Registration Solution Using DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Gang Chen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jiang-dhc-addr-registration-04.txt</link>
    <description>In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking management plate for the purposes of central address administration. This document introduces a generic address registration solution using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND option and one new DHCPv6 option in order to propagate the solicitations of registering self-generated addresses. The registration procedure reuses the existing IA_NA in the DHCPv6 protocol.</description>
