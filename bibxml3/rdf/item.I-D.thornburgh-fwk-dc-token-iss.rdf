    <title>"A Framework For Decentralized Bearer Token Issuance in HTTP", Michael Thornburgh</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thornburgh-fwk-dc-token-iss-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a protocol framework for HTTP clients to obtain bearer tokens for accessing restricted resources, where in some applications the client may not have prior knowledge of, or a direct relationship with, the resource server's authorization infrastructure (such as in decentralized identity systems).  Semi-concrete applications of the framework using proof-of-possession and TLS client certificate mechanisms are also described.</description>
