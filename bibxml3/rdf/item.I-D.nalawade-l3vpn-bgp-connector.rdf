    <description>In the case of BGP AFIs such as IPv6 unicast or VPNv4 unicast, it is possible for the data traffic intended for the NLRIs of that AFI/SAFI, to be forwarded over an underlying tunnel. The tunnel may be to a PE or to a Tunnel Concentrator or a Tunnel Broker. Both will be referred to as Tunnel endpoints. In this document an egress router refers to the egress point of the Tunnel and an ingress router refers to the ingress point of the tunnel. The discovery of the Tunnel endpoint and the corresponding tunnel encapsulation information may be done out of band, either by static configuration, or through a number of different mechanisms. There is a need to be able to indicate with the BGP update for a given NLRI, the Tunnel endpoint to be used for forwarding data traffic to that NLRI destination. This document defines a new BGP attribute called the 'Connector Attribute' which would convey the information about the Tunnel endpoint - the Tunnel Identifier, the Tunnel endpoint address.</description>
