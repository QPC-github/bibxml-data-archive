    <description>This document describes the IKEv2 Mediation Extension (IKE-ME), a connectivity extension to the Internet Key Exchange IKEv2.  IKE-ME allows two peers, each behind one or more Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls to establish a direct and secure connection without the need to configure any of the intermediate network devices.  To establish this direct connection, a process similar to Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is used.</description>
