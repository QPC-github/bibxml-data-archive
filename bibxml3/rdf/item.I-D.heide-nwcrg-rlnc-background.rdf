    <description>This document describes the use of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) schemes for reliable data transport.  Both block and sliding window RLNC code implementations are described.  By providing erasure correction using randomly generated repair symbols, such RLNC-based schemes offer advantages in accommodating varying frame sizes and dynamically changing connections, reducing the need for feedback, and lowering the amount of state information needed at the sender and receiver.  The practical considerations' section identifies RLNC- encoded symbol representation as a valuable target for standardization.</description>
