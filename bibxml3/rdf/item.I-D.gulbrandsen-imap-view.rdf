    <title>"The IMAP VIEW extension", Arnt Gulbrandsen, Abhijit Menon-Sen</title>

    <description>The VIEW extension allows an [IMAP] client to create and manipulate mailbox views (persistent searches). All [IMAP] clients can access a view, as if it were an ordinary mailbox. Clients which implement the VIEW extension can create views. Clients which implement both VIEW and [LISTEXT] can find and modify existing views.</description>
