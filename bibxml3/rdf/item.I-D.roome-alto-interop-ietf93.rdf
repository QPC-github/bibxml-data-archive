    <description>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such information to applications that need to choose one or more endpoints to connect to among large sets of logically equivalent ones.  This document defines a data set that may be used to test the functionality and interoperability of ALTO clients and servers.</description>
