    <description>The Web Real-Time Communication [WebRTC] working group is charged to provide protocol support for direct interactive rich communication using audio, video and data between two peers' web browsers.  With in the WebRTC framework, Session Description protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] is used for negotiating session capabilities between the peers.  Such a negotiation happens based on the SDP Offer/Answer exchange mechanism described in [RFC3264].  This document provides an informational reference in describing the role of SDP and the Offer/Answer exchange mechanism for the most common WebRTC use-cases.  This SDP examples provided in this document is still a work in progress, but it aims to align closest to the evolving standards work.</description>
