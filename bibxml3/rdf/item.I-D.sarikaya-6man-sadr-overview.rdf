    <title>"Source Address Dependent Routing and Source Address Selection for IPv6 Hosts: Problem Space Overview", Behcet Sarikaya, Mohamed Boucadair</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sarikaya-6man-sadr-overview-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents the source address dependent routing (SADR) problem space from the host perspective.  Both multihomed hosts and hosts with multiple interfaces are considered.  Several network architectures are presented to illustrate why source address selection and next hop resolution in view of source address dependent routing is needed.  The document is scoped on identifying a set of scenarios for source address dependent routing from the host perspective and analyze a set of solutions to mitigate encountered issues.  The document does not make any solution recommendations.</description>
