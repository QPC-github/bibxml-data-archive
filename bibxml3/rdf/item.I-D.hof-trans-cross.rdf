    <description>A malicious Certificate Transparency (CT) log can offer a modified tree to a client in a "split view" attack.  This document proposes to extend CT by submitting Signed Tree Heads (STH) into another log, run by a different operator.  Auditors and monitors can use these cross logged STHs to detect split view attacks by the log.</description>
