    <description>Recently, a number of routing loop vulnerabilities were discovered in the Teredo mechanism, which typically result in a Denial of Service of the involved systems, possibly also affecting the intervening networks.  This document describes a number of security checks that can be performed by Teredo hosts and Teredo servers such that these vulnerabilities are eliminated.</description>
