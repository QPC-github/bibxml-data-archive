    <description>To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution. Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the fact, but must not impact an operational production network. The base metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.  Metrics derived from these will be described separately. This document details the recommended usage for the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM).</description>
