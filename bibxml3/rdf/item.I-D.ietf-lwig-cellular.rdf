        <title>"Building Power-Efficient CoAP Devices for Cellular Networks", Jari Arkko, Anders Eriksson, Ari Keranen</title>
        <dc:date>2016-01-04T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ cellular networks as a communications medium.  Building communicating devices that employ these networks is obviously well known, but this memo focuses specifically on techniques necessary to minimize power consumption.</description>
