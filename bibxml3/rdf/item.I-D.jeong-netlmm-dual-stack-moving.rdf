    <title>"Network-based Mobility Support for Dual Stack Nodes", Sangjin Jeong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jeong-netlmm-dual-stack-moving-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes the network-based mobility support for dual stack mobile nodes moving into an IPv4-only or an IPv6-only subnetwork within a NETLMM domain. This memo also presents a network-based global mobility management protocol with support of IPv4-IPv6 traversal. By utilizing this document, mobile nodes can move from an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack localized domain to an IPv6-only (or IPv4-only) localized domain without any IP session disruption.</description>
