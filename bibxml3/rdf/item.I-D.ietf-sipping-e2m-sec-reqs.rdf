    <title>"Requirements for End-to-middle Security for the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Kumiko Ono, Shinya Tachimoto</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-e2m-sec-reqs-06.txt</link>
    <description>A SIP User Agent (UA) does not always trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers contained in its message. The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/ or headers from intermediaries except those that provide services based on its content. This situation requires a mechanism called 'end-to-middle security' to secure information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere with end-to-end security. This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.</description>
