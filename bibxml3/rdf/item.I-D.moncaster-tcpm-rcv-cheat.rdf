    <title>"A TCP Test to Allow Senders to Identify Receiver Non-Compliance", Toby Moncaster, Bob Briscoe, Arnaud Jacquet</title>

    <description>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely feedback to the sender.  Currently the sender has no means to verify that a receiver is correctly sending this feedback according to the protocol.  A receiver that is non-compliant has the potential to disrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing its transmission rate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect the network itself.  This document presents a two stage test process that can be used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant.  The tests enshrine the principle that one shouldn't attribute to malice that which may be accidental.  The first stage test causes minimum impact to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance.  The second stage test can then be used to verify that the receiver is non-compliant.  This specification does not modify the core TCP protocol - the tests can either be implemented as a test suite or as a stand-alone test through a simple modification to the sender implementation.</description>
