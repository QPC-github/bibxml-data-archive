    <title>"Common PGP/MIME Message Mangling", Daniel Gillmor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dkg-openpgp-pgpmime-message-mangling-00.txt</link>
    <description>An e-mail message with OpenPGP encryption and/or signature has standard form.  However, some mail transport agents damage those forms in transit.  A user-friendly mail user agent that encounters such a mangled message may wish to try to process it anyway, despite the message's non-standard structure.  This document aims to be a sort of bestiary of common message mangling patterns, along with guidance for implementers for how to cope with messages structured in these common ways.</description>
