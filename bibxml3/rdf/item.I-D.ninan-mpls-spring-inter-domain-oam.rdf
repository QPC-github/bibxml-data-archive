        <description>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages source routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the use of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane.  A network may consist of multiple IGP domains or multiple ASes under the control of same organization.  It is useful to have the LSP Ping and traceroute procedures when an SR end-to-end path spans across multiple ASes or domains.  This document describes mechanisms to facilitae LSP ping and traceroute in inter-AS/inter-domain SR networks in an efficient manner with simple OAM protocol extension which uses dataplane forwarding alone for sending echo reply.</description>
