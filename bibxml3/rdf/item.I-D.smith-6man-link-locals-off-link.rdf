    <description>Certain link-layers limit reachability for one set of nodes, while permitting full reachability for a different set of nodes, for unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic.  If IPv6 hosts are members of the first set of nodes, and IPv6 routers are members of the second, Link-Local traffic between IPv6 hosts will fail, due to the default on-link assumption for Link-Local destinations.  This memo describes the use of a Link-Local Prefix Information Option to indicate to these hosts that Link-Local destinations are "off-link", and are reachable via their default router(s).</description>
