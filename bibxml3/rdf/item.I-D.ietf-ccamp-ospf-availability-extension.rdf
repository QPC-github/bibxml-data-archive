    <description>A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such links may change discretely in reaction to changing external environment. Availability is typically used for describing such links during network planning. This document defines a new type of the Generalized Switching Capability-specific information (SCSI) TLV to extend the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. The extension can be used for route computation in a network that contains links with variable discrete bandwidth. Note, this document only covers the mechanisms by which the availability information is distributed. The mechanisms by which availability information of a link is determined and the use of the distributed information for route computation are outside the scope of this document. It is intended that technology- specific documents will reference this document to describe specific uses.</description>
