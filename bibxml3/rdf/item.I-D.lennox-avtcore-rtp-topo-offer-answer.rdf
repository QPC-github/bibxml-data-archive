    <title>"Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Topology Considerations for Offer/ Answer-Initiated Sessions.", Jonathan Lennox</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lennox-avtcore-rtp-topo-offer-answer-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses a number of considerations related to the topologies of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions initated using the Session Description (SDP) unicast Offer/Answer Model, especially as applied to source-multiplexed sessions.  The primary observation is that certain topologies cannot be created by unicast SDP Offer/Answer.  Notably, the it is not possible to negotiate the topology that RFC 5117 calls Topo-Transport-Translator (or "relay").  As a consequence of this limitation, certain topological assumptions can safely be made for RTP sessions initiated using unicast SDP Offer/Answer; and therefore, certain optimizations to RTP are possible in such sessions.  This document also describes the optimizations that these assumptions make possible.</description>
