    <description>This document describes the neighborhood discovery protocol for the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2. The protocol provides each node with local topology up to two hops distance, describing a node's 1-hop neighbors and symmetric 2-hop neighbors. This is achieved through periodic message exchange. The neighborhood discovery protocol may be used by other MANET protocols which need neighborhood information. The protocol imposes minimum requirements to the network by not requiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control traffic.</description>
