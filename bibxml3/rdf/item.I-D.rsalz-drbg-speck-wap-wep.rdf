    <title>"No MTI Crypto without Public Review", Rich Salz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rsalz-drbg-speck-wap-wep-01.txt</link>
    <description>Cryptography is becoming more important to the IETF and its protocols, and more IETF protocols are using, or looking at, cryptography to increase privacy on the Internet [RFC7258].  This document specifies a proposed best practice for any mechanism (or data format) that uses cryptography; namely, that RFCs cannot specify an algorithm as mandatory-to-implement (MTI) unless that algorithm has had reasonable public review.  This document also "sketches out" a rough definition around what such a review would look like.</description>
