    <title>"Upgrading Communication from Stub Resolvers to DoT or DoH", Puneet Sood, Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pp-add-stub-upgrade-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes methods for a DNS stub resolver to upgrade its communications with a known recursive resolver to include encrytion using DoT or DoH.  This protocol is designed for the scenario where the stub resolver already has the IP address of the recursive resolver.  Other protocols under develpment address scenarios where the stub resolver wants to discover recursive resolvers that use DoT or DoH. This document does not cover such discovery.</description>
