    <title>"Updating RFCs", Erik Wilde</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilde-updating-rfcs-00.txt</link>
    <description>As part of document metadata, RFCs can reference existing RFC that they update or obsolete.  While obsoleting is well-understood (replace the obsoleted RFC in its entirety), updating has more nuances because the updated RFC remains valid.  This document contains some clarifications about how to handle updating in a way that makes it easier for readers to understand how the original and the updating RFC relate.  Note to Readers  This draft should be discussed on the wgchairs mailing list [1].  Online access to all versions and files is available on github [2].</description>
