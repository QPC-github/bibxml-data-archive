    <description>The existing DTLS-SRTP specification allows SRTP keys to be established between a pair of SRTP endpoints.  However, when there are more than two participants in an SRTP session, DTLS-SRTP is unable to provide a single key for all of the participants.  This existing limitation of DTLS-SRTP prevents deploying DTLS-SRTP in certain scenarios.  This document describes an extension to DTLS-SRTP called Key Transport (KTR).  This extension transports SRTP keying material from one DTLS-SRTP peer to another, so the same SRTP keying material can be used by multiple DTLS-SRTP peers.  This extension eliminates the need to key each SRTP session individually, allowing cost-effective deployment of several DTLS-SRTP scenarios.</description>
