    <title>"S/MIME Proxy Forwarding", Wei Chuang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wchuang-grunion-01.txt</link>
    <description>S/MIME provides the means to protect message body content but does not protect the sender and recipient identity nor other headers.  We propose a means to do so by proxying the sending and receiving via a trusted SMTP server.  This document describes how the proxyies are discovered and the wrapped messages created.  This then describes how the proxy forwarding is done.</description>
