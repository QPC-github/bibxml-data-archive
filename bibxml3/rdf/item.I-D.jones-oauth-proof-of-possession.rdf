    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jones-oauth-proof-of-possession-02.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines how to express a declaration in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof-of- possession of the key by the presenter.  This property is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.</description>
