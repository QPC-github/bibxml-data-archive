    <description>This document discusses the framework for enhancements to the GMPLS architecture to control sub-wavelength switching optical networks. Sub-wavelengths refer to the time-shared utilization of a single wavelength by optical bursts, packets or slots.  Sub-wavelngth technologies are the base of new cost-effective network architectures.  In particular, they are sutited for metro areas, to cope with high traffic volumens as well as more demanding requirements of networked applications.</description>
