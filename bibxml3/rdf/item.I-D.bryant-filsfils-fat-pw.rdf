    <description>Where the payload carried over a pseudowire carries a number of identifiable flows it can in some circumstances be desirable to carry those flows over the equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packet switched network.  Most forwarding engines are able to hash based on label stacks and use this to balance flows over ECMPs. This draft describes a method of identifying the flows, or flow groups, to the label switched routers by including an additional label in the label stack.</description>
