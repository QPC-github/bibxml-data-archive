    <title>"Framework for GMPLS Control of Flexible Grid Network", Qilei Wang, Xihua Fu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-ccamp-gmpls-flexigrid-framework-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to control the flexible grid network base on the Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).  GMPLS control of WSON which is addressed in RFC6163 is out of the scope of this document.  This document focuses on the topological elements changes and new path selection constraints that flexible grid technology takes. Impairments related technology is not covered in this document.</description>
