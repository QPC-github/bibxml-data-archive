    <title>"5G Wireless Wireline Convergence User Plane Encapsulation (5WE)", Dave Allan, Donald Eastlake, David Woolley</title>

    <description>As part of providing wireline access to the 5G Core (5GC), deployed wireline networks carry user data between 5G residential gateways and the 5G Access Gateway Function (AGF). The encapsulation method specified in this document supports the multiplexing of traffic for multiple PDU sessions within a VLAN delineated access circuit, permits legacy equipment in the data path to inspect certain packet fields, carries 5G QoS information associated with the packet data, and provides efficient encoding. It achieves this by specific points of similarity with the RFC 2516 PPPoE data packet encapsulation.</description>
