    <title>"Secure Access Mechanism for DHCPv6", Yiu Lee, Yong Cui, ZiLong Liu, Linhui Sun</title>

    <description>DHCPv6 [RFC3315] provides configuration parameters such as IPv6 network addresses for hosts.  The unencrypted nature and use of various identifiers make its privacy and security become more vulnerable.  With appropriate protection mechanisms, the privacy and security can be improved to some extent.  This document specifies such a mechanism that builds a trusted relationship between DHCPv6 clients and servers before solicitation.  The mechanism enables a valid client to find and access the legitimate server or reject and blacklist a rogue server.</description>
