    <description>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance targets.  This is done by section-by-section testing -- by applying a suite of single property tests to successive sections of a long path. In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria.  The sub-path at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to- end path from meeting the users target performance.  This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP performance.  The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic TCP but are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP over the sub-path under test.  This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics, which rely on congestion control equilibrium behavior.  A natural consequence of this methodology is verifiable network measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are repeatable from other vantage points.</description>
