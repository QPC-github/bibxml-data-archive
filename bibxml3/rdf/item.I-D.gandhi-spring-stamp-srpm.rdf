        <description>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document describes procedures for Performance Measurement in SR networks using the mechanisms defined in RFC 8762 (Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)) and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 and further augmented in draft-ietf-ippm-stamp-srpm.  The procedure described is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both links and end-to- end SR paths including SR Policies.</description>
