    <description>This document specifies an experimental DHCPv6 default route option which provisions static routing information to client nodes.  The option facilitates central configuration of a multi-access client node's default router list with the IPv6 address, MAC address, and lifetime of the route, which is preferred in certain multi-access network environments.  In addition, the DHCP option defined in this document can provide operational simplicity in network coverage extension scenarios using inexpensive (and limited resource) consumer-grade equipment.  Finally, the proposed DHCP option has been implemented and tested in practice; its experimental use points to benefits with respect to reduced signaling and energy consumption compared to existing default route configuration mechanisms.</description>
