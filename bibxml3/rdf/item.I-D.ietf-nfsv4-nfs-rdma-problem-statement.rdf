    <title>"NFS RDMA Problem Statement", Thomas Talpey, Chet Juszczak</title>

    <description>This draft addresses enabling the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) by the Network File System (NFS) protocols.  NFS implementations historically incur significant overhead due to data copies on end-host systems, as well as other processing overhead. The potential benefits of RDMA to these implementations are explored, and the reasons why RDMA is especially well-suited to NFS and network file protocols in general are evaluated.</description>
