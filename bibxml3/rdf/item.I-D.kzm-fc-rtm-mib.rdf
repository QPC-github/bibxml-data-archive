    <title>"Fibre-Channel Routing Information MIB", Claudio DeSanti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kzm-fc-rtm-mib-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to routing within a Fibre Channel fabric which is independent of the usage of a particular routing protocol. At present, this memo is in development as part of the SM-RTM project of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</description>
