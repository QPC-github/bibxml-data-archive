    <title>"Pervasive Encryption as a Countermeasure to Pervasive Monitoring", Stephen Kent</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kent-pervasive-encryption-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns about "pervasive monitoring" as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass- attack].  It begins by exploring terminology that has been used in IETF standards (and in academic publications) to describe encryption and key management techniques, with a focus on authentication vs. anonymity.  Based on this analysis, it propose a new term, "pervasive encryption" (PE) to describe a goal for IETF security protocols, one countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.</description>
