    <title>"Dynamic Symmetric Key Provisioning Protocol", Mingliang Pei, Salah Machani</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pei-dynamic-symkey-prov-protocol-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a symmetric key provisioning protocol that supports provisioning of symmetric keys (One Time Password (OTP) keys or symmetric cryptographic keys) and associated attributes dynamically to already issued different types of strong authentication devices. This work is a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify a protocol that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe that a common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability between commercial and open-source implementations.</description>
