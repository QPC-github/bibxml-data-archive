    <title>"Auditing of Congestion Exposure (ConEx) signals", David Wagner, Mirja Kuehlewind</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wagner-conex-audit-02.txt</link>
    <description>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow.  Reliable auditing is necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx information honestly.  This document defines how the signals are handled by an audit and lists requirements for an audit implementation.  This document does not mandate a particular design but identifies state and functions that any auditor element must provide to fulfill the requirements stated in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech].</description>
