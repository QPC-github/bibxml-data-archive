    <title>"Link Viability Constraints Requirements for GMPLS-enabled Networks", Don  Fedyk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ashwood-ccamp-gmpls-constraint-reqts-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes requirements for connecting a pure photonic sub-domain to a GMPLS-based Label Switch Router. One of the main requirements is to avoid advertising all the physical properties of the underlying optical hardware while still peering with standard GMPLS. This draft discusses the requirements for abstracting the optical topology and the implications of various abstract models. This draft discusses possible extensions to [OSPF-TE] [GMPLS- Routing] and [ISIS-TE] for use by GMPLS networks that require additional constraints to be considered in the computation of viable paths.</description>
