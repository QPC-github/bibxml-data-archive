    <description>This document describes the IGMP and the ICMPv6 multicast traceroute facility. Unlike unicast traceroute, multicast traceroute requires special packet types and implementations on the part of routers. This specification describes the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how management applications can use the new router functionality.</description>
