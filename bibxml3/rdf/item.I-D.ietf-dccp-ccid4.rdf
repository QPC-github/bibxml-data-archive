    <title>"Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion ID 4:  TCP-Friendly Rate Control for Small Packets (TFRC-SP)", Sally Floyd, Eddie Kohler</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dccp-ccid4-05.pdf</link>
    <description>This document specifies a profile for Congestion Control Identifier 4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP [RFC4828], a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets.  CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time.  The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion.  CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.</description>
