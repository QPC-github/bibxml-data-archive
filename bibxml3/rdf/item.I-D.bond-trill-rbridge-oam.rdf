    <title>"RBridges: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Support", David Bond, Vishwas Manral</title>

    <description>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count.  As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise.  This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses.  The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</description>
