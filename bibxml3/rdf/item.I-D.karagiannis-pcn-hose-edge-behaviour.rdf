    <description>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain.  The behaviour described here is denoted as the HOSE model.</description>
