    <description>The security policies currently applied in Internet with IPv4, doesn’t longer apply for end-to-end security models which IPv6 will enable. Today, each network is often secured by a unique device (i.e. security gateway or firewall), that becomes a bottleneck for the end- to-end security model with IPv6. In addition, users and devices start to be nomadic, moving between different networks that could have different security policies. A distributed and dynamic approach is consequently required, as already described by [1].</description>
