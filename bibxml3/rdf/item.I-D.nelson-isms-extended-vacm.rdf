    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nelson-isms-extended-vacm-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a backward compatible extension to the View-based Access Control Model for SNMPv3 for use with RADIUS and other AAA services to provide authorization of MIB database access.  This extension is intended to be used in conjunction with secure SNMP Transport Models that facilitate RADIUS authentication, such as the Secure Shell Transport Model.</description>
