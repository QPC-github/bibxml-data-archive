    <description>The scale at which RSVP-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) get deployed is growing continually and the onus is on RSVP-TE implementations across the board to keep up with this increasing demand.  This document makes a set of implementation recommendations to help RSVP-TE deployments push the envelope on scaling and advocates the use of a couple of techniques - "Refresh Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP)" and "Per-Peer flow-control" - for improving scaling.</description>
