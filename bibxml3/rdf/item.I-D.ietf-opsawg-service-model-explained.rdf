    <description>The IETF has produced many modules in the YANG modeling language. The majority of these modules are used to construct data models to model devices or monolithic functions.  A small number of YANG modules have been defined to model services (for example, the Layer Three Virtual Private Network Service Model produced by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049).  This document describes service models as used within the IETF, and also shows where a service model might fit into a Software Defined Networking architecture.  Note that service models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed through the Customer-Provider Interface.</description>
