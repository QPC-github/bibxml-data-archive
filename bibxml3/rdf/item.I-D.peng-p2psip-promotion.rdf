    <title>"Proposals for RELOAD to support Promotion and Demotion for User-owned Nodes", Jin Peng, Deng Lingli, Lifeng Le, Gang Li, Xiao Ma</title>

    <description>This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible client promotion and demotion modes.  RELOAD aims at providing a uniform protocol for both overlay clients and peers, where promotion of a client to peer is triggered and completed at the client's pleasure.  It is proposed that RELOAD provide a more restrictive framework to enable passive promotion and demotion, where decisions are made by the network rather than individual user-owned nodes.</description>
