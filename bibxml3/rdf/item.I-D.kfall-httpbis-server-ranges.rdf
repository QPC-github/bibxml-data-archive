    <title>"Server Oriented Range Responses", Kevin Fall</title>

    <description>This document clarifies the semantics associated with the Content-Range HTTP header and associated Partial Content (206) response code.  It specifically allows a server to produce a Content-Range response whose range is a subrange of the corresponding range requested using a previous Range request. The HTTP protocol syntax is not modified. Instead, this document clarifies that a server responding to a client requesting a range (x-y) may respond with a range ((x+e)-(y-f)) for nonzero integers e,f such that (x+e) &lt; (y-f). In addition, it clarifies the semantics of Request ranges which contain only a starting value.</description>
