    <title>"BGP Regisries by IDR and other BGP WGs", Susan Hares</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hares-idr-bgp-registries-01.pdf</link>
    <description>The BGP Registries at IANA were set up as one of the earliest IANA registries.  Over time, the registries have become denoted as requiring "standards action", "early allocation", "FCFS (first-come, first served)", "vendor specific", and "IETF review".  This draft proposes that certain BGP registries that are labelled "standards action", "early allocation", or "IETF Review" add to these registration actions a "Expert Review.  It also proposes that the chairs of BGP Protocol related WG groups be part of the review team. The intent is that these chairs will be responsible for bringing questionable allocations to their workings attention.  The BGP relate working groups are currently the IDR, BESS, SIDROPS, and GROW, but other working groups like SPRING might be added.</description>
