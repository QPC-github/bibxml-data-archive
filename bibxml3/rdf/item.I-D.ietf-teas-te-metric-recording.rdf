    <description>There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics such as cost, delay and delay variation associated with the TE link formed by Label Switched Path (LSP) are not available to the ingress and egress nodes. This draft provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to support automatic collection of cost, delay and delay variation information for the TE link formed by a LSP.</description>
