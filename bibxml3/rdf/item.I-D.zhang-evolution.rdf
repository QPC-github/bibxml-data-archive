    <description>Internet routing scalability has long been considered a serious problem.  Although many efforts have been devoted to address this problem over the years, the IETF community as a whole is yet to achieve a shared understanding on what is the best way forward.  In this draft, we step up a level to re-examine the problem and the ongoing efforts. we conclude that, to effectively solve the routing scalability problem, we first need a clear understanding on how to introduce solutions to the Internet which is a global scale deployed system.  In this draft we sketch out our reasoning on the need for an evolutionary path towards scaling the global routing system, instead of attempting to introduce a brand new design.</description>
