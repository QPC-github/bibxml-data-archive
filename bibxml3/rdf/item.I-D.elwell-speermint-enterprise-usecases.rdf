    <title>"Use cases for Enterprise Peering using the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", John Elwell, Benny Rodrig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-speermint-enterprise-usecases-00.txt</link>
    <description>Work in the SPEERMINT Working Group has focused to some extent on peering between carrier VoIP Service Providers (VSP). This draft describes some use cases involving SIP peering between enterprise VSPs, with and without the involvement of carrier VSPs, and also peering between enterprise VSPs and carrier VSPs. It also discusses some of the key technical considerations applicable to these use cases. This work is being discussed on the speermint@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
