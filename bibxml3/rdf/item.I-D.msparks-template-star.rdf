    <description>Service synchronisation for Television And Related devices (STAR) is a suite of application level protocols to enable network connected devices to correlate events on a broadcast system with events outside that broadcast system.  It is a generic suite of protocols, that enables playback of content retrieved from over a network such that it is synchronised to a broadcast source.  It also enables correlation of non-broadcast events (such as conversations) to broadcast events.  Key features of STAR include: 1) The broadcast system does not require modification 2) It is designed to work with restricted clients limited to stream connections - such as web browsers 3) It is content agnostic.  This specification describes the research implementation as it stands today, and is published as a starting point for further discussion.</description>
