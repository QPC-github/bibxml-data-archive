    <title>"SASL Yet Another Password Mechanism", Kurt Zeilenga</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zeilenga-sasl-yap-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called  YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ, for use in protocols which support Simple   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework. The mechanism   relies on security services provided by a lower layer, such as   Transport Layer Security (TLS), to protect the authentication exchange, and subsequent application data exchange, from common attacks.  The YAP-SHA-256-TLS-UNIQ mechanism can be viewed as an alternative to other password-based SASL mechanism, such as PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.</description>
