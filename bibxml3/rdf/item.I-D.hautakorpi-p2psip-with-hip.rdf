    <title>"Utilizing HIP (Host Identity Protocol) for P2PSIP (Peer-to-peer Session  Initiation Protocol)", Jani Hautakorpi, Gonzalo Camarillo, Joakim Koskela</title>

    <description>This document specifies how Host Identity Protocol (HIP) can be utilized in Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) networks.  Peers in a P2PSIP network need to have long-lived connections to other peers in the network, and HIP can be utilized to setup and maintain those connections.  HIP is a good choice for connection maintenance, because it provides functionalities like Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal, mobility, multi-homing, and enhanced security properties.</description>
