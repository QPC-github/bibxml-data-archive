    <description>Internet storage services have become more and more popular.  They attract a huge number of users and produce a significant share of Internet traffic.  Most existing Internet storage services make use of proprietary sync protocols with different capabilities to achieve the data sync.

It also shows a demand for designing a standard sync protocol to achieve better usability and sync performance.</description>
