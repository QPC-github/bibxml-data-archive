    <title>"Integrity Protection for Control Messages in NHDP and OLSRv2", Ulrich Herberg, Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen</title>

    <description>This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2). This document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV) and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats.  The ICV TLV uses a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared secret key.  The timestamp TLV is based on POSIX time, and assumes that the clocks in all routers in the network can be synchronized with sufficient precision. The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other MANET protocols using RFC5444.</description>
