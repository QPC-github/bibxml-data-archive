    <title>"Voluntary Application Server Identification for Web Push", Martin Thomson, Peter Beverloo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-webpush-vapid-02.txt</link>
    <description>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service using the described technique.  This identification information can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity. This can used to reduce the secrecy for push subscription URLs by being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific application server.  An application server is further able include additional information the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application server.</description>
