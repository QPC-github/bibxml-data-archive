    <description>Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming, Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data Centers.  These data centers are geographically distributed and connected via a network.  Many decisions are made in the Application space without any concern of the underlying network.  Cross stratum application/network optimization focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by data center based applications and carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR].  Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.  [RFC4655] explains the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.  This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path Computation.</description>
