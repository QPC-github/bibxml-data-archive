    <description>This document defines a data model to support the Filter-based Routing Information Base (RIB) Yang data models.  A routing system uses the Filter-based RIB to program FIB entries that process incoming packets by matching on multiple fields within the packet and then performing a specified action on it.  The FB-RIB can also specify an action to forward the packet according to the FIB entries programmed using the RIBs of its routing instance.  The Filter based RIB is a protocol independent data structure which can be deployed in a configuration datastore, an ephemeral control plane data stroe.</description>
