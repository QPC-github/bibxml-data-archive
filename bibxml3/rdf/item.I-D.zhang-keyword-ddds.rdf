    <title>"The keyword to Uniform Resource Identifier(URI) Dynamic Delegation Discovery  System(DDDS) Application(Keyword)", Guoqiang Zhang, XiaoDong Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-keyword-ddds-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo discusses the use of the Domain Name System(DNS) for storage of Keyword to URI mapping.  More specifically, how DNS can be used for identifying URIs associated with one Keyword.  The method used to discover the mapping is the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, which can be found in a series of documents specified in RFC 3401.  It is very important to note that it is impossible to read and understand this document without reading the documents discussed in RFC 3401.</description>
