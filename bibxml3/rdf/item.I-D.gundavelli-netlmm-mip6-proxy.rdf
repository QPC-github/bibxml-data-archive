    <title>"Localized Mobility Management using Proxy Mobile IPv6", Sri Gundavelli, Kent  Leung</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gundavelli-netlmm-mip6-proxy-00.txt</link>
    <description>Localized Mobility Management (LMM) requires mobility support for a mobile station within a restricted and topologically localized portion of the network. Mobile IPv6 is a standardized mobility protocol for IPv6 that can be extended to address the local mobility management requirements. This document describes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 scheme by introducing new functional entities and extensions to the protocol and by restricting the mobility signaling to only certain entities in the network.</description>
