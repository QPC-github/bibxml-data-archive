    <title>"Middlebox Communication Enabling for Enhanced User Experience", Attila Mihaly, Szilveszter Nadas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mihaly-spud-mb-communication-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this draft we address some of the key discussion points related to the scope of Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams (SPUD). Specifically, we show how we can define the middlebox communication framework such that it allows uneven resource sharing on the path among the endpoints enhancing in this way the user experience. Issues related to trust and incentives as well as how to support user decisions in this eco-system are clarified.</description>
