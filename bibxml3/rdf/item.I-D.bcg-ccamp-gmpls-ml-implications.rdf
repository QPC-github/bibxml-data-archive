    <description>This document describes requirements for MRN application to multiple hierarchies of technologies (e.g.  OTN, SDH, ETH).  For this purpose, after summarizing MRN definitions, rationales and currently supported applications, a problem statement is introduced together with its implications on GMPLS routing and signaling.  New functional requirements are derived and MRN extensions required to address them are identified.</description>
