    <description>This memo serves to register and document the "font" Top Level Type, under which the Internet Media subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered.  This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.</description>
