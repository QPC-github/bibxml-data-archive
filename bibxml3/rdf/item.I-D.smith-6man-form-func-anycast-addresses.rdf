    <description>Currently, IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing IPv6 unicast address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast addresses through configuration.  An alternative scheme would be to have a special class of addresses for use as anycast addresses.  This memo proposes a distinct general anycast addressing class for IPv6, and a more specific scheme for functional anycast addresses.</description>
