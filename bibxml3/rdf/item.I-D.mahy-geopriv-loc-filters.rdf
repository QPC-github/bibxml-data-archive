    <description>This document describes filters which limit asynchronous location notifications to compelling events. The resulting location information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped in GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information Document Format (PIDF-LO). Location disclosure is limited to voluntary disclosure by a notifier that possesses credentials for the named resource.</description>
