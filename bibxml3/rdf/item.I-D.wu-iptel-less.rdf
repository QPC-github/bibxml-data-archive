    <title>"LESS: Language for End System Services in Internet Telephony", Xiaotao Wu, Henning Schulzrinne</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wu-iptel-less-00.txt</link>
    <description>In Internet telephony, end systems can take a large role in providing services, especially in networks without pre-configured infra-structure, such as peer-to-peer networks. Since we believe that end system services differ in their requirements from network services, we define a new service creation scripting language called the Language for End System Services (LESS). LESS inherits man characteristics from the Call Processing Language (CPL). It contains commands and events for direct user interaction and the control of media applications. This document defines the basic elements of LESS and several commonly used LESS extensions.</description>
