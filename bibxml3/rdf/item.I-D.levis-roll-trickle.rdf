    <description>The Trickle algorithm allows wireless nodes to exchange information in a highly robust, energy efficient, simple, and scalable manner. Dynamically adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission times while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.  A simple suppression nechanism and transmission point selection allows Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with density.  This document describes Trickle and considerations in its use.</description>
