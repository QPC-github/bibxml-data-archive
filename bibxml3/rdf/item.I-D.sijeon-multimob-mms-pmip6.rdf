    <title>"Mobile Multicasting Support in Proxy Mobile IPv6", Seil Jeon, Younghan Kim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sijeon-multimob-mms-pmip6-02.txt</link>
    <description>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [I-D.ietf-multimob- pmipv6-base-solution] has been submitted as a base solution that locates MR on the LMA and uses the PMIPv6 tunnel between LMA and MAG for MLD messages. In this draft, we present the direct routing solution that uses the direct connection between MAG and MR, and locates the MLD forwarding proxy function on MAGs. The proposed direct routing solution is compared with the base deployment solution.</description>
