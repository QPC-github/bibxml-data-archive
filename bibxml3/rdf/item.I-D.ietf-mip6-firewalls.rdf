    <description>Network elements such as firewalls are an integral aspect of a majority of IP networks today, given the state of security in the Internet, threats, and vulnerabilities to data networks. Current IP networks are predominantly based on IPv4 technology and hence firewalls have been designed for these networks. Deployment of IPv6 networks is currently progressing, albeit at a slower pace. Firewalls for IPv6 networks are still maturing and in development. Mobility support for IPv6 has been standardized as specified in RFC 3775. Given the fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent standard, most firewalls available for IPv6 networks do not support Mobile IPv6. Unless firewalls are aware of Mobile IPv6 protocol details, these security devices will interfere in the smooth operation of the protocol and can be a detriment to deployment. This document captures the issues that may arise in the deployment of IPv6 networks when they support Mobile IPv6 and firewalls. The issues are not only applicable to firewalls protecting enterprise networks, but are also applicable in 3G mobile networks such as GPRS/ UMTS and CDMA 2000 networks. The goal of this Internet draft is to highlight the issues with firewalls and Mobile IPv6 and act as an enabler for further discussion. Issues identified here can be solved by developing appropriate solutions in the MIP6 WG.</description>
