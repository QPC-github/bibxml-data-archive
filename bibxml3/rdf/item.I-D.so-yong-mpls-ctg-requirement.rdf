    <description>This document presents motivation, a problem statement and operational requirements for a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLS network when multiple links are configured between two routers. It defines a composite link as a group of parallel links that can be considered as a single traffic engineering link or as an IP link, and used for MPLS.  The framework described in a companion document is used to organize the requirements.</description>
