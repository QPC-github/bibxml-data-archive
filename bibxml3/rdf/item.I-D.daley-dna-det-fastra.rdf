    <description>Neighbour Discovery forces routers responding to Router Solicitations to delay a random interval of 0-500 ms in order to prevent contention and bandwidth utilization by multiple responding routers. Routers receiving solicitations may need to quickly send responding Router Advertisements faster than allowed in IPv6 Neighbour Discovery.</description>
