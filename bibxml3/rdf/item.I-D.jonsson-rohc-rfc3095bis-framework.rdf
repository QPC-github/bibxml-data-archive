    <title>"The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Framework", Lars-Erik Jonsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jonsson-rohc-rfc3095bis-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient, flexible and future-proof header compression concept. It is designed to operate efficiently and robustly over various link technologies with different characteristics. RFC 3095 defined the ROHC framework along with an initial set of compression profiles. To improve and simplify the specification, it has been agreed that the framework and the profiles parts of RFC 3095 be split into separate documents. This document explicitly defines the ROHC framework, and thus replaces the framework specification of RFC 3095.</description>
