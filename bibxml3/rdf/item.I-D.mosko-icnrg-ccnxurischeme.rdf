    <description>This document defines an RFC3986 URI compliant identifier called a Labeled Segment URI in which name segments carry a label.  This allows differentiation between unrelated resources with similar identifiers.  This document also specifies the CCNx URI scheme, called "ccnx:," which conforms to the labeled segment encoding rules presented here.  The CCNx URI scheme applies specific labels to each name segment of a URI to disambiguate between resources with similar names.  This document defines a specific set of segment labels with label semantics.</description>
