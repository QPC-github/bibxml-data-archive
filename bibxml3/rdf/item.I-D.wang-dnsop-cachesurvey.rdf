    <title>"A Survey of the DNS cache service in China", Wei Wang, Zhiwei Yan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-dnsop-cachesurvey-00.txt</link>
    <description>DNS cache directly serves the DNS queries from stub resolvers as the data source in the specified network area. For the present, however, operators manage and run the cache service in a diversified manner. This arouses the main motivation of this survey report. Instead of regulating or specifying the operation of the DNS cache service, our aim is to investigate the situation of the DNS cache service (at least in mainland China) and propose the future operation recommendations with solid practical foundation.</description>
