    <title>"Service-Oriented Address Assignment using DHCPv6", Syam Madanapalli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-soa-option-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces a new option in DHCPv6 for Service-Oriented Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv6 Clients provide. The Service-Oriented Address can be either Anycast/Shared Unicast or a Well-known Unicast Address. This address assignment is much similar to other address type assignments, except that Service-Oriented Address assignment requires the specification of Service Type of the node that is requesting the address.</description>
