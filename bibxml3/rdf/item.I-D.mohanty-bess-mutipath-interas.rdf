    <description>By default, The Border Gateway Protocol, BGP only installs the best- path to the IP Routing Table.  BGP multi-path is a well known feature that enables installation of multiple paths to the IP Routing Table. This is done to achieve load balancing while forwarding traffic.  For a path to be eligible as a multi-path, certain criteria need to be fulfilled.  Inter-AS VPNs are commonly deployed to span organizations across Service Provider boundaries.  In this draft, we describe an issue relating to multi-path load balancing that can arise in an Option B Inter-AS Deployment.  With the help of a representative topology, we illustrate the problem and then present two simple schemes as the solution to the problem.  We also note as a matter of independent interest that the same underlying issue is applicable to deployments that employ next-hop-self behavior (implicit or explicit) downstream and the multi-path feature upstream.</description>
