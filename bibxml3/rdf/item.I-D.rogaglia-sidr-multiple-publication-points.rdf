    <title>"Multiple Repository Publication Points support in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)", Roque Gagliano, Terry Manderson, Carlos Martinez</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rogaglia-sidr-multiple-publication-points-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying Parties (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate specified in the different "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the Repository Objects located at the Certificate Authorities (CA) repositories hosted in its respective publication point.  This document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a single public key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of multiple repository publication point operators for every CA in the RPKI.  This document provides also recommendation for the RP behavior when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications points.</description>
