    <description>The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based access networks. It carries EAP over UDP which permits ISPs to use multiple authentication methods. However, in roaming environments IP clients might change of gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur. This can considerably degrade performance. To solve this problem, the PANA WG is currently working on a solution based on context transfer between PANA Authentication Agents. The aim of this document is to analyze how this proposal works in a WLAN environment considering various deployment scenarios.</description>
