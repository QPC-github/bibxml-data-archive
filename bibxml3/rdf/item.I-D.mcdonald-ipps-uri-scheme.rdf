    <title>"IPP over HTTPS Transport Binding and 'ipps' URI Scheme", Ira McDonald, Michael Sweet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mcdonald-ipps-uri-scheme-18.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS transport binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is used to designate the access to the network location of a secure IPP print service or a network resource managed by such a service.  This document defines an alternate IPP transport binding to that defined in the original IPP URL Scheme (RFC 3510), but this document does not update or obsolete RFC 3510.  This document updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.</description>
