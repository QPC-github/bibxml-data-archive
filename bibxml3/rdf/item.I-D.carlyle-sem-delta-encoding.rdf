    <description>Semantic Delta Encoding with HTTP defines an efficient stateless mechanism for multiple clients to become synchronised and stay synchronised with a large resource through the transmission of semantic deltas (distinct from RFC3229), and supports a long poll option for timely delivery.  It is intended to support web browsers needing to keep up to date with changes of state on an origin server as well as to support a wide variety of other realtime and non- realtime synchronisation requirements between communicating systems.</description>
