    <description>A multi-homed host with multiple physical and/or virtual network interfaces has to select which one of the network interfaces to use for a new outgoing IPv4 or IPv6 connection. This document describes a method to select an interface by using destination's fully qualified domain name and DNS suffix information received dynamically for each network interface. The method is useful, for example, in split horizon DNS and walled garden scenarios, where right network interface has to be selected even before DNS resolution is conducted.</description>
