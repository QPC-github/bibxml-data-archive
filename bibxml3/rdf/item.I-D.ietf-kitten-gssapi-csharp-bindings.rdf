    <description>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document specifies the C# language bindings for GSS-API which is described at a language independent conceptual level in RFC 2743 [RFC2743]. The GSS-API C# bindings were designed to emulate the Java bindings as defined in RFC 2853 [RFC2853].</description>
