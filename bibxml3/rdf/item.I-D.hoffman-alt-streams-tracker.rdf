    <title>"Data Tracker States and Annotations for the IAB, IRTF, and Independent Submission Streams", Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-alt-streams-tracker-15.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extending the IETF Datatracker to capture and display the progression of Internet-Drafts that are intended to be published as RFCs by the IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submissions Editor.  The states and annotations that are to be added to the Datatracker will be applied to a Internet-Drafts as soon as any of these streams identify the Internet-Draft as a potential eventual RFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the Internet-Draft. The goal of adding this information to the Datatracker is to give the whole Internet community more information about the status of these Internet-Drafts and the status of the RFC streams themselves.</description>
