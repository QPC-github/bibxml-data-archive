    <title>"PCP Server Discovery based on well-known IP Address", Sebastian Kiesel, Reinaldo Penno</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kiesel-pcp-ip-based-srv-disc-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to reduce application keep alive traffic.  This document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during the discovery and regular operation phases.</description>
