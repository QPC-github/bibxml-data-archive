    <title>"Extending the Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header for Preemption  Events", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-reason-header-for-preemption-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to include in a BYE Method Request as a result of a session preemption event, either at a user agent (UA), or somewhere in the network involving a reservation- based protocol such as RSVP or NSIS. This document does not attempt to address routers failing in the packet path; but a deliberate event of tearing down a flow between UAs, and informing the terminated UA(s) with an indication of what occurred.</description>
