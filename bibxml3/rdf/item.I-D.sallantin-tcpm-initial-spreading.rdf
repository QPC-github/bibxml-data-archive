    <description>This document proposes a new fast start-up mechanism to improve the short-lived TCP connections performance.  Initial Spreading allows to safely increase the Initial Window size in any cases, and notably in congested networks.  Merging the increase in the IW with the spacing of the segments belonging to the Initial Window (IW), Initial Spreading is a very simple mechanism that improves short-lived TCP flows performance and does not deteriorate long-lived TCP flows performance.</description>
