    <description>This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets protocol. A ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a granted right to traverse a network or a request for network services to be applied. Applications request tickets from a local agent in the network and attach issued tickets to packets. Firewall tickets are issued to grant packets the right to traverse a network; service tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to a packets. A single ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket information. Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</description>
