    <description>You should probably not read this.  It's not done.  Not every domain name is intended to appear in the global DNS.  It is also possible that not everything that looks like a domain name is intended to be one.  Regardless of whether a given name is intended to appear in the DNS, such names often turn up in domain name slots. When choosing a naming scheme that is not intended to be part of the global DNS, it is necessary to understand the architectural implications of using domain names or a domain-name-like syntax.</description>
