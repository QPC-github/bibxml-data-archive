    <description>Overhead due to the movement of user data in the end-system network I/O processing path at high speeds is significant, and has limited the use of Internet protocols in interconnection networks and the Internet itself - especially where high bandwidth, low latency and/or low overhead are required by the hosted application. This draft examines this overhead, and addresses an architectural, IP-based "copy avoidance" solution for its elimination, by enabling Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).</description>
