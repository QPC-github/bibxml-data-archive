    <title>"Use of Multipath with MPLS-TP and MPLS", Curtis Villamizar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-villamizar-mpls-multipath-use-02.txt</link>
    <description>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks.  MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.  Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS LSPs can be carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.</description>
