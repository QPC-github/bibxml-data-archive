    <title>"Temporal Aggregation of Metrics", Steven Van den Berghe</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-svdberg-ippm-temporal-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo intends to define metrics that allow to aggregate metric samples over a time interval. Metrics that are identical in type and scope but collected at different times, or in different time windows, can be aggregated into a new metric that characterizes the full time interval. The document additionally introduces some comments on terminology and motivation that could be the basis for a more general framework for metric composition.</description>
