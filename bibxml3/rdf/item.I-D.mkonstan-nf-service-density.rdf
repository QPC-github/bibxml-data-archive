    <description>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) system designers and operators continuously grapple with the problem of qualifying performance of network services realised with software Network Functions (NF) running on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) servers.  One of the main challenges is getting repeatable and portable benchmarking results and using them to derive deterministic operating range that is production deployment worthy.  This document specifies benchmarking methodology for NFV services that aims to address this problem space.  It defines a way for measuring performance of multiple NFV service instances, each composed of multiple software NFs, and running them at a varied service "packing" density on a single server.  The aim is to discover deterministic usage range of NFV system.  In addition specified methodology can be used to compare and contrast different NFV virtualization technologies.</description>
