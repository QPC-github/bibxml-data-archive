    <title>"Consolidated IASA 2.0 Updates of IETF Administrative Terminology", John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iasa2-consolidated-upd-07.txt</link>
    <description>In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative structure and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0" structure.  In addition to more substantive changes that are described in other documents, the transition to the 2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes several position titles and organizational relationships that are referenced elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents individually, this specification provides updates to them and deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no confusion due to these changes.</description>
