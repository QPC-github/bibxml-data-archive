    <title>"Alternative Constraints for Point-to-Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Path(LSP)", Zhenbin Li, Tieying Huang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-mpls-p2mp-te-alt-path-01.txt</link>
    <description>The document proposes a solution to be able to set up the alternative path for specific leaf nodes of a P2MP TE LSP.  Corresponding RSVP-TE protocol extension is also defined.  The solution is used to cope with the issue that in some scenarios traffic loss happens even if there exists possible path for the leaf nodes.</description>
