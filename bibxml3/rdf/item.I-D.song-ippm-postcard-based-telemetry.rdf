        <description>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the IOAM DEX option, referred to as IOAM Marking.  Similar to IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not carry the telemetry data in user packets but send the telemetry data through a dedicated packet.  Unlike IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not require an extra instruction header.  IOAM Marking raises some unique issues that need to be considered.  This document formally describes the high level scheme and cover the common requirements and issues when applying IOAM Marking in different networks.  IOAM Marking is complementary to the other on-path telemetry schemes such as IOAM trace and E2E options.</description>
