    <title>"Handling Long Lines in Artwork in Internet-Drafts and RFCs", Kent Watsen, Qin Wu, Adrian Farrel, Benoit Claise</title>

    <description>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\') character where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any text based artwork, but is primarily intended for sample text and formatted examples and code, rather than for graphical artwork.  The approach produces consistent results regardless of the content and uses a per-artwork header.  The strategy is both self-documenting and enables automated reconstitution of the original artwork.</description>
