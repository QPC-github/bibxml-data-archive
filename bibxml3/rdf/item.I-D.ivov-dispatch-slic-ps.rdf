    <title>"Dispatching Sound Level Indicators in Conferences (Problem Statement)", Emil Ivov, Enrico Marocco</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ivov-dispatch-slic-ps-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Conferencing Framework described in RFC 4353 defines the semantics necessary for conducting conference calls with the session initiation protocol.  It also introduces a mixer entity responsible for combining all media streams and delivering them to the participants of the call.  This document presents the lack of a standardized way for such mixers to deliver information about the audio activity (sound level) of participants in a conference call. The document describes the problem and discusses a few possible ways of transporting such information.</description>
