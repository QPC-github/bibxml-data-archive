    <description>IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) can be used to provide access for IPv4-only hosts or applications to IPv4-only or dual-stack destinations over IPv6-only infrastructure.  In that case, the traffic flows are translated twice: first from IPv4 to IPv6 (stateless NAT46 at the ingress point to the IPv6-only infrastructure) and then from IPv6 back to IPv4 (stateful NAT64, at the egress point).  When the destination is IPv6-enabled, the second translation might be avoided.  This document describes a possible optimization to 464XLAT and MAP-T to avoid translating IPv6 flows back to IPv4 if the destination is reachable over IPv6.  The proposed solution would significantly reduce the NAT64 utilization in the operator's network, increasing the performance.</description>
