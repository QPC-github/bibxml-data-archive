    <title>"An Identity Key-based and Effective Signature for Origin-Unknown Types", Hadriel Kaplan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kaplan-stir-ikes-out-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism and format for signing source identity information of communication requests, in a manner capable of crossing multiple communication protocol types - even if the origin's protocol type is unknown.  This is useful for providing E.164 and other forms of Caller-ID reputability for various communication protocols, such as SIP, XMPP, WebRTC, H.323, and SS7/ISUP.</description>
