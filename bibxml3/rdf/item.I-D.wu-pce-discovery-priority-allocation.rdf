    <title>"IGP extension for PCEP transport capability support in the PCE discovery", Wenson Wu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wu-pce-discovery-priority-allocation-01.txt</link>
    <description>[RFC5088][RFC5089] define a method to advertise path computation capabilities using IGP flooding.  OSPF and ISIS are extended to support such capabilities advertisement.  However [RFC5088][RFC5089]don't provide a method to advertise PCEP over TLS support capability.  This document proposes new capability flag bit for PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub- TLV that can be announced as attribute in the IGP advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ][RFC5089]) to distribute transport support information.</description>
