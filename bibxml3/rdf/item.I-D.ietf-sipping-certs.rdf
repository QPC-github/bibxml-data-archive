    <title>"Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Cullen Jennings, Jon Peterson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-certs-03.txt</link>
    <description>This draft defines a Credential Service that allows Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP package to discover the certificates of other users. This mechanism allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the Credential Service. The Credential Service also allows users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.</description>
