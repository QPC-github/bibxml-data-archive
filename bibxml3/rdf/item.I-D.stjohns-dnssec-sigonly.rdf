    <title>"Signature-Only DNSSEC: A Simplified Approach", Michael StJohns</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stjohns-dnssec-sigonly-00.txt</link>
    <description>Work on the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)( [RFC4033] et al) has been in progress for close to 15 years and DNSSEC is still not "mature" enough to be considered complete. A substantial issue is the complexity of the system. This document describes a simplified version of DNSSEC that can co-exist with the current protocols, but with characteristics such that the author believes it can be implemented and deployed with much less effort.</description>
