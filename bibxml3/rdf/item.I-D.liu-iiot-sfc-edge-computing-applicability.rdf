    <description>Decoupling functions from the industrial hardware enables diverse, migratable, cross-industry replicable applications to be deployed with flexibility at the edge and on the cloud.  Users should be free to adjust their business policies in industrial IoT and with low cost.  Therefore efficient and dynamic orchestration of the applications is critical.  This document describes several use cases that demonstrate the applicability of Service Function Chaining in industrial edge computing to organize the applications and provides extra requirements to support this applicability.</description>
