    <title>"Designed Routing in BIER Forwarding", Zheng Zhang, Wu Bo</title>

    <description>BIER specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets.  As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] said, in the BIER domain, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distributing trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state.  In some deployments, some specific multicast flows may be forwarded by special routing; it cannot be achieved by the forwarding rule that is provided.  In this document we will defined a new routing list in BIER header, the packets will be steered according to the routing list.</description>
