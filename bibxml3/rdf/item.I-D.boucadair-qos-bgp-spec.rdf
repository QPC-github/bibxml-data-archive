    <description>This  memo  describes  a  proposal  for  exchanging  QoS-enabled reachability information between service providers. It defines new BGP attributes to be used in order to convey QoS performance characteristics between service providers and it describes how to use these QoS values in order to select the best path. An example of route selection process that takes into account the QoS performance values enclosed in BGP messages is also detailed.</description>
