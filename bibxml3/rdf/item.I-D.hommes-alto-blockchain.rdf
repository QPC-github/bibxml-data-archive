    <description>With the inception of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the underlying concept of the blockchain has now attracted a large number of application scenarios.  Due to the decentralised nature of a typical blockchain service, a reliable communication between the different nodes is a mandatory requirement.  RFC7285 describes the idea of using Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) that is used to improve the communication in peer-to-peer networks.  This document describes the benefits of using ALTO in the context of a blockchain network, and highlights the improvements for a private, consortium and public blockchain.</description>
