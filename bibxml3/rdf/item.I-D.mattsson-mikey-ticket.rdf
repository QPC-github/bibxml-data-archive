    <title>"MIKEY-TICKET: Ticket Based Modes of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)", John Mattsson, Tian Tian</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mattsson-mikey-ticket-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key management scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we note that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios built around a centralized key management service.  Such deployments are gaining in interest. Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios are defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also support features used by many existing applications, where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of the communication session.</description>
