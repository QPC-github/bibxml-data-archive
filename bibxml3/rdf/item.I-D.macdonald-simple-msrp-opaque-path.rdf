    <title>"Opaque MSRP Path Uri", Derek MacDonald</title>

    <description>The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy and topology hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address of their systems.  This limitation is due to the fact that MSRP Path headers contain physical IP addresses.  This document describes a mechanism which adds a level of indirection to allow privacy and topology hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middle from learning the IP Address and port information of the MSRP client. It also defines the option tag msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.</description>
