    <title>"The Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme", Vincent Roca, Aline Roumy, Bessem Sayadi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-roca-rmt-goe-ldpc-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Generalized Object Encoding (GOE) FEC Scheme for the protection of one or multiple objects, in the context of a Content Delivery Protocol (CDP) like FLUTE/ALC, FCAST/ALC or FCAST/NORM.  Unlike [RFC5052], the GOE approach [GOE] decouples the definition of Generalized Objects over which FEC encoding takes place homogeneously, from the natural source object boundaries.  This separation enables either an Unequal Erasure Protection (UEP) of different portions of a given source object, or an efficient and global protection of a set of potentially small files, depending on the way the Generalized Objects are defined.  The present document defines the GOE LDPC-Staircase FEC Scheme, i.e., the GOE version of the FEC Encoding ID 3 (LDPC-Staircase) defined in [RFC5170] with the further restriction that the number of encoding symbols per group (i.e., the number of symbols sent in the same packet) MUST be equal to 1 (G=1).  This document does not change the LDPC-Staircase code definition, and therefore it inherits most of [RFC5170].  It only modifies the FEC Payload ID and FEC OTI, i.e., it addresses the problem of UEP and efficient file bundle protection by means of pure signaling approach.</description>
