    <title>"Considerations for MPTCP operation in 5G", Debashish Purkayastha, Michelle Perras, Akbar Rahman</title>

    <description>MPTCP is deployed in devices which have multiple interfaces to different networks.  It takes advantage of these multiple interfaces to improve user experience by bandwidth aggregation, redundancy, and increased reliability by having a fallback option.  This document describes scenarios where next generation (5G) mobility management frameworks may impact MPTCP operations thus potentially jeopardizing achievement of some of these gains.</description>
