    <description>The loop-free alternates computed following the current Remote-LFA specification guarantees only link-protection.  The resulting Remote- LFA nexthops (also called PQ-nodes), may not guarantee node- protection for all destinations being protected by it.  This document describes an extension to the Remote Loop-Free based IP fast reroute mechanisms, that specifes procedures for determining if a given PQ-node provides node-protection for a specific destination or not.  The document also shows how the same procedure can be utilized for collection of complete characteristics for alternate paths.  Knowledge about the characteristics of all alternate path is precursory to apply operator defined policy for eliminating paths not fitting constraints.</description>
