    <title>"SMTP and MIME Extensions For Content Conversion", Kiyoshi Toyoda, Dave  Crocker</title>

    <description>A message originator sometimes sends content in a form the recipient cannot process. Such content needs to be converted to a related form, with the same or with restricted information, such as changing from color to black and white. In a store-and-forward environment, it can be convenient to have this conversion performed by an intermediary. This specification integrates two ESMTP extensions and three MIME content-types, to permit authorized, accountable content form conversion by intermediaries.</description>
