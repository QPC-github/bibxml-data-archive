    <title>"A Simpler Method for Resolving Alert-Info URNs", Dale Worley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-alert-info-fsm-10.txt</link>
    <description>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used in the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the call that the user agent has originated or terminated.  The user agent must resolve the URNs into a signal, that is, it must select the best available signal to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call.  RFC 7462 describes a non-normative algorithm for signal selection. This document describes a more efficient alternative algorithm: A user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's signals and their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the definition of the "alert" URN namespace.</description>
