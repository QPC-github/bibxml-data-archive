    <description>This document presents a topology-transparent zone (TTZ) in an OSPF area.  A topology-transparent zone comprises a group of routers and a number of links connecting these routers.  Any router outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  A TTZ hides the internal topology of the TTZ from the outside.  It does not directly advertise any internal information about the TTZ to a router outside of the TTZ. The information about the links and routers such as a link down inside the TTZ is not advertised to any router outside of the TTZ.</description>
