    <title>"CONFORMANCE OF ACROSSING NON-BIER NODES", Zheng Zhang, fangwei hu</title>

    <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building protocol.  There may be some routers which could not support BIER technology (We name them as non-BIER node in this document) in the BIER domain when deployed. This document specifies a solution for the BIER packet transiting the non-BIER nodes.</description>
