    <title>"The IPv4 DHCP Options for the Internet Storage Name Service", Charles Monia, Josh Tseng, Kevin Gibbons</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-isnsoption-13.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the DHCP option to allow Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) clients to automatically discover the location of the iSNS server through the use of DHCP for IPv4. iSNS provides discovery and management capabilities for Internet SCSI (iSCSI) and Internet Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) storage devices in an enterprise-scale IP storage network. iSNS provides intelligent storage management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a similar capacity as a storage area network.</description>
