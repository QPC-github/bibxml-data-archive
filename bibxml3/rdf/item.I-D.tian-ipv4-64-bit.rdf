    <description>This document describes a 64-bit address mechanism that serves as an extension to IPv4, namely, IPv4_64.  As an add-on to IPv4, this extension is designed to solve the IPv4 address exhaustion issue in an innovative way, and slightly improve some IPv4 functions at the same time.</description>
