    <title>"Link-Layer Addresses Assignment Mechanism for DHCPv6", Bernie Volz, Tomek Mrugalski, Carlos Bernardos</title>

    <description>In certain environments, e.g. large scale virtualization deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner.  Such devices typically have their link-layer (MAC) addresses randomized.  With sufficient scale, the likelihood of collision is not acceptable. Therefore an allocation mechanism is required.  This draft proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments.</description>
