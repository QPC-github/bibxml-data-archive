    <title>"Virtual Private LAN Services Using LDP", Marc Lasserre, Vach Kompella</title>

    <description>This document describes a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution using pseudo-wires, a service previously implemented over other tunneling technologies and known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of users, i.e., it creates a Layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that is closed to a given set of users. Multiple VPLS services can be supported from a single PE node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling pseudo-wire labels using LDP [RFC3036], extending [RFC4447]. It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing, in particular, on the learning of MAC addresses. The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by [RFC4448].</description>
