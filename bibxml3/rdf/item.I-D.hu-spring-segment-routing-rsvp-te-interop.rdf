    <description>A Segment Routing (SR) node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called segments.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based.  Segment Routing (SR) is a protocol designed to forward packets on the network based on the concept of source routing.  The Segment Routing architecture can be directly applied to the MPLS data plane with no change in the forwarding plane.  It simplifies the MPLS control protocol, simplifies the configuration of the network, and can achieve SDN better.  Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) has the ability of path planning and resource reservation.  In the process of traditional network evolution to Segment Routing, there will inevitably be coexistence of RSVP-TE and Segment Routing.  The Document describes how to interact with nodes that support Segment Routing capabilities and nodes that support RSVP-TE capabilities.</description>
