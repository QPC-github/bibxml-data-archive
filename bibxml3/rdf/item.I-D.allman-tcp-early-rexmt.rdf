    <title>"Early Retransmit for TCP and SCTP", Mark Allman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-allman-tcp-early-rexmt-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a new mechanism for TCP and SCTP that can be used to recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window is small.  The "Early Retransmit" mechanism allows the transport to reduce, in certain special circumstances, the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger a fast retransmission.  This allows the transport to use fast retransmit to recover packet losses that would otherwise require a lengthy retransmission timeout.</description>
