    <title>"Design and Implementation of an XCAST6 Routing Engine", Elisha Abade, Nobuo Kawaguchi</title>

    <description>XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined in RFC 5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encoded within the data packets instead of using a multicast group address. Research is currently ongoing on two versions of XCAST6 and this document describes the design and implementation of a routing engine for the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop options header has been eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for an XCAST6 routing engine, highlights the requirements for its implementation, the design process and how to eventually implement the routing engine to allow for deployment of XCAST6 protocol.</description>
