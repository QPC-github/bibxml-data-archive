    <title>"Reclassification of 6to4 as an Experimental Protocol", Keith Moore</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moore-6to4-experimental-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo explains why the 6to4 specifications are being reclassified as Experimental protocols.  It also makes recommendations for limiting the scope of continued use of 6to4 for those wishing to use it.  These recommendations are being made in light of decreasing applicability of 6to4 and of operational problems associated with its use.</description>
