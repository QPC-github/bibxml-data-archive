    <title>"Requirements to Extend the Datatracker for IETF WG Chairs and Authors", Ed Juskevicius</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-juskevicius-datatracker-wgdocstate-reqts-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies requirements for new functionality to be added to the IETF Datatracker tool to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs and their Delegates to input and update the status of the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) associated with their WGs.  After these requirements are implemented, WG Chairs will be able to use the Datatracker to provide everyone with more information about the status and progression of WG I-Ds than is currently possible.</description>
