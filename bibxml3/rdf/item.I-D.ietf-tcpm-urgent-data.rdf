    <title>"On the implementation of the TCP urgent mechanism", Fernando Gont, Andrew Yourtchenko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tcpm-urgent-data-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document analyzes how current TCP implementations process TCP urgent indications, and how the behavior of some widely-deployed middle-boxes affect how urgent indications are processed by end systems.  This document updates the relevant specifications such that they accommodate current practice in processing TCP urgent indications, raises awareness about the reliability of TCP urgent indications in the Internet and recommends against the use of the urgent indications (but provides advice to applications in case that they do).</description>
