    <description>This document describes the procedures a client can follow to assess the trust on an external NSF platform and its client-defined configuration through the I2NSF Security Controller.  The procedure to assess trustworthiness is based on a remote attestation of the platform and the NSFs running on it performed through a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) invoked by the Security Controller.</description>
