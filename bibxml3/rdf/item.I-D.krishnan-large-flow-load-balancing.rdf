    <description>The demands on the networking infrastructure are growing exponentially; the drivers are bandwidth hungry rich media applications, inter data center communications etc. In this context, it is important to optimally use the bandwidth in the service provider backbone networks which extensively use LAG/ECMP techniques for bandwidth scaling. This internet draft describes the issues faced in the service provider backbone in the context of LAG/ECMP and formulates best practice recommendations for managing the bandwidth efficiently in the service provider backbone.
