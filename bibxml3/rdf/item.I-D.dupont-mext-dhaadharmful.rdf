    <title>"Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) Considered Harmful", Francis  Dupont, Jean-Michel Combes, Maryline Laurent-Maknavicius</title>

    <description>The Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) mechanism is described in the Mobile IPv6 specification.  This mechanism is mandatory in any compliant Mobile IPv6 implementation and so in any MIPv6 based protocols too.  On the other hand, DHAAD was the only one mechanism to discover a potential Home Agent for a Mobile Node in the past.  This is no longer the case today.  This document analyzes the security of the different existing home agent discovery mechanisms and promotes the remove of DHAAD from the future Mobile IPv6 standard, in light of this security analysis.</description>
