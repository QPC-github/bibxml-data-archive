    <description>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document defines the rules for encoding IPP operations, attributes, and values into the Internet MIME media type called "application/ ipp".  It also defines the rules for transporting a message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp" over HTTP and/or HTTPS.  The IPP data model and operation semantics are described in IPP/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911bis].  This document obsoletes RFCs 2910 and 3382.</description>
