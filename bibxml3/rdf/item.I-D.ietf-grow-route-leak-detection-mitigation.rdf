        <description>Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route leaks are provided in RFC 7908.  This document describes a new well- known Large Community that provides a way for route-leak prevention, detection, and mitigation.  The configuration process for this Community can be automated with the methodology for setting BGP roles that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.</description>
