    <description>This document defines the Origin attribute for cookies, which lets servers harmonize the security policy of their cookies with the widely used same-origin policy.  Origin cookies provide both confidentiality and integrity, unlike the Secure attribute, which provides only confidentiality.Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send email to &lt;mailto:http-state@ietf.org>.
