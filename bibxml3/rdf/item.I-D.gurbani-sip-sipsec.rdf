    <description>Currently, in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), there does not exist any means for a user agent client (UAC) to signal to the destination user agent server (UAS) that an end-to-end secure channel is to be established. Instead, what is prevalent today in the protocol is a hop-by-hop security model, wherein intermediaries forward a request towards the destination without the UAC knowing whether or not the intermediary behaved in a trusted manner (i.e., it did not, unknown to the UAC, downgrade the security of the downstream channel from the intermediary onwards). This document discusses the security properties of a hop-by-hop model; and in doing so, formulates requirements an for an end-to-end security model and a solution that satisfies these requirements.</description>
