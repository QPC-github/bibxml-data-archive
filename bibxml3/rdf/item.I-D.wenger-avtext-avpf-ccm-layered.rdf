    <title>"Using Codec Control Messages in the RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback with Layered Codecs", Stephan Wenger, Jonathan Lennox, Bo Burman, Magnus Westerlund</title>

    <description>This document fixes a shortcoming in the specification language of the Codec Control Message Full Intra Request (FIR) as defined in RFC5104 when using with layered codecs.  In particular, a Decoder Refresh Point needs to be sent by a media sender when a FIR is received on any layer of the layered bitstream, regardless on whether those layers are being sent in a single or in multiple RTP flows. The other payload-specific feedback messages defined in RFC 5104 and RFC 4585 as updated by RFC 5506 have also been analyzed, and no corresponding shortcomings have been found.</description>
