    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-song-alto-overlay-routing-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an ALTO protocol extension for overlay routing.  It considers three different methods to route traffic from a data source to a data receiver, which are direct Internet routing, VPN tunnel, and overlay routing via intermediate/relay node(s), analyze their use cases in real world and then proposes an extension to ALTO protocol so as to support a ALTO client to get cost value between hosts via these different routing methods.</description>
