    <title>"Communication Units Granularity Considerations for Multi-Path Aware Transport Selection", Philipp Tiesel, Theresa Enghardt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tiesel-taps-communitgrany-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an approach how to reason about the composition of multi-path aware transport stacks.  It discusses how to compose the functionality needed by stacking existing internet protocols and the fundamental mechanisms that are used in multi-path systems and the consequences of applying them to different granularities of communication units, e.g, on a message or stream granularity.  This document is targeted as guidance for automation of destination selection, path selection, and transport protocol selection.</description>
