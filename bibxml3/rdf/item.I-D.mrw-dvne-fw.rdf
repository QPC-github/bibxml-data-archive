    <description>This document discusses the management and configuration requirements for large Virtual Networks (VNs).  VNs are private networks that employ tunneling technologies to overlay private network links over physical IP networks.  As VNs grow, the amount of administrative effort required to manually configure virtual nodes and to set up the required tunnels becomes prohibitive.  The DVNE protocol automates this process, elminating much of the administrative work involved in setting up a virtual network.</description>
