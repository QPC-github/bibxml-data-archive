    <title>"JSON Hyper-Schema: A Vocabulary for Hypermedia Annotation of JSON", Henry Andrews, Austin Wright</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-handrews-json-schema-hyperschema-02.txt</link>
    <description>JSON Schema is a JSON-based format for describing JSON data using various vocabularies.  This document specifies a vocabulary for annotating JSON documents with hyperlinks.  These hyperlinks include attributes describing how to manipulate and interact with remote resources through hypermedia environments such as HTTP, as well as determining whether the link is usable based on the instance value. The hyperlink serialization format described in this document is also usable independent of JSON Schema.</description>
