    <title>"Revision of the Recall Initiation Model", Moonesamy S, John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moonesamy-recall-rev-03.txt</link>
    <description>The procedures for initiating a recall specified in RFC 7437 restrict signatories of a recall petition to those who are "nomcom qualified". This document suggests those limitations had unanticipated and undesirable side-effects and proposes to remove them.  It also specifies that remote participants should be allowed to seek redress through the procedures and decreases the number of signatories required for a recall petition.  This document updates RFC 7437.</description>
