    <description>One of the most important OAM capabilities for transport network operation is fault localisation.  An in-service, on-demand segment monitoring function of a transport path is indispensable, particularly when the service monitoring function is activated only between end points.  However, the current segment monitoring approach defined for MPLS (including the transport profile (MPLS-TP)) in RFC 6371 "Operations, Administration, and Maintenance Framework for MPLS- Based Transport Networks" has drawbacks.  This document provides an analysis of the existing MPLS-TP OAM mechanisms for the path segment monitoring and provides requirements to guide the development of new OAM tools to support a Hitless Path Segment Monitoring (HPSM).</description>
