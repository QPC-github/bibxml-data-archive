    <description>For efficient DNA, a host should quickly receive an RA upon a new link-layer connection. This draft presents a quick RA acquisition scheme with the support of a link-layer entity, PoA (Point of Attachment). Upon a new network attachment, the PoA may either trigger an AR (Access Router) to immediately send an unicast RA, "RA Triggering" or send such an RA for itself, "RA Proxying". We may put "RA Triggering" or "RA Proxying" functionality on a PoA to get the optimized result without IPv6 standard change.</description>
