    <title>"Usage of Non Shortest Path Forwarding (NSPF) IDs in OSPF", Uma Chunduri, Yingzhen Qu, Jeff Tantsura</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ct-ospf-nspfid-for-sr-paths-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the advertisement of Non Shortest Path Forwarding IDentifier (NSPF ID) TLV and the computation procedures for the same in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols.  NSPF ID allows to simplify the data plane path description of data traffic in SR deployments.  This helps to mitigate the MTU issues that are caused by additional SR overhead of the packet and allows traffic statistics.</description>
