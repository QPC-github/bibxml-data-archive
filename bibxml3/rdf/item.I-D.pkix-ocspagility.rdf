    <description>The OSCP specification defined in RFC 2560 requires server responses to be signed but does not specify a mechanism for selecting the signature algorithm to be used leading to possible interoperability failures in contexts where multiple signature algorithms are in use. This document specifies an algorithm for server signature algorithm selection and an extension that allows a client to advise a server that specific signature algorithms are supported.</description>
