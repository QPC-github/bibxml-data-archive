    <title>"Route Leaks &amp; MITM Attacks Against BGPSEC", Danny McPherson, Shane Amante, Eric Osterweil</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-foo-sidr-simple-leak-attack-bgpsec-no-help-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the IETF's Secure Inter-Domain Routing working group during routing security requirements discussions and subsequent specification.</description>
