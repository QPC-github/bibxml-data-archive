    <title>"DNS authoritative server misconfiguration and countermeasure in resolver", Kazunori Fujiwara</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fujiwara-dnsop-bad-dns-auth-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes misconfigurations of DNS authoritative servers and its effect to old DNS iterative resolver servers we experienced. We recommend re-checking DNS authoritative server configuration and advise using newer iterative resolver server implementations. The recommendations made in this document are based on analysis of abnormal DNS resolver server load at large ISP resolver server which has many customers. This is not protocol issue.</description>
