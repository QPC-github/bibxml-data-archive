    <title>"Using RPL Headers Without IP-in-IP", Jonathan Hui, Pascal Thubert, JP Vasseur</title>

    <description>Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a routing protocol designed for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs).  RPL includes routing information in IPv6 data plane datagrams to help maintain the routing topology.  When forwarding a datagram into a RPL domain, a RPL router may need to expand the datagram to include routing information in IPv6 Extension headers.  A generic solution has been defined that uses IP-in-IP tunneling to include RPL routing information.  This document describes an alternative to inserting and removing RPL information in datagrams without the use of IP-in-IP tunneling.</description>
