    <description>IPv4 address is estimated to run out shortly. So as [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4] stated, we have to consider IPv6 only node for smooth transition. On the other hand, IETF have deprecated the NAT-PT with some reasons. And now we need to seek alternative solutions. Before talking specific technology, we need to consider overall strategy for translation technology.</description>
