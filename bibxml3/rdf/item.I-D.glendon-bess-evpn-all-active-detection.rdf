    <title>"EVPN ALL-ACTIVE ANYCAST DETECTION", Haibo Wang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-glendon-bess-evpn-all-active-detection-00.txt</link>
    <description>A principal feature of EVPN is the ability to support universal detection including ping/trace, twamp, 2544, 1564 and so on.  This draft specifies a mechanism of valid universal detection in all- active anycast scenes based on connectivity negotiations to avoid detection interruption due to the inconsistency between the request packet path and the response packet path.</description>
