    <title>"Inter-AS Option D for BGP/MPLS IP VPN", Manu Pathak, Keyur Patel, Arjun Sreekantiah</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mapathak-interas-ab-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a new option known as an Inter-AS option D to the 'Multi-AS Backbones' section of [RFC4364].  This option combines VPN VRFs at the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' with the distribution of labeled VPN-IP routes as described in 'Option B'.  In addition, this option allows for a data plane consisting of two methods of traffic forwarding between attached ASBR pairs.</description>
