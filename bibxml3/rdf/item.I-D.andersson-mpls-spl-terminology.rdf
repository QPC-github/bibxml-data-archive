    <description>This document discusses and recommends a terminology that may be used when MPLS Special Purpose Labels (SPL) are specified and documented.  Note: The rest of the text in this section is not really part of the abstract even though the text is placed here.  It is working notes.  Note: At least at the moment it is not the intention to take this document to an RFC, but it might be polled to become a wg document to see if the MPLS working group agree on the proposed terminology.  Note: The changes we propose are minor, but we might have to progress the document to RFC since there is a proposed change to the "Special- Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values" registry.</description>
