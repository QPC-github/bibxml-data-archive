    <title>"HTTP Extension to provide timing data for performance measurement", Mike McCall</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mccall-httpbis-timing-measurements-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to gather relevant performace data from compliant user-agents.  Though the HTML 5 standard supplies Nav-Timings there is no standard way for that data to be communicated back to an origin.  The intention of this document is to describe a method in which that can be done cleanly and scalably.</description>
