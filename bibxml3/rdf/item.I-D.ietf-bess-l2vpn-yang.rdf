    <description>This document describes a YANG data model for Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) services over MPLS networks.  These services include point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) and multipoint Virtual Private LAN service (VPLS) that uses LDP and BGP signaled Pseudowires.  It is expected that this model will be used by the management tools run by the network operators in order to manage and monitor the network resources that they use to deliver L2VPN services.  This document also describes the YANG data model for the Pseudowires. The independent definition of the Pseudowires facilitates its use in Ethernet Segment and EVPN data models defined in separate document.</description>
