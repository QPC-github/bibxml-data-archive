    <title>"CoRE Link-Format to DNS-Based Service Discovery Mapping", Kerry Lynn, Zach Shelby</title>

    <description>Resource and service discovery are complimentary.  Resource discovery provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while service discovery can provide a scalable method to locate servers in large networks.  This document defines a method for mapping between CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based Service Discovery fields to allow either method to be used to locate service interfaces down to the granularity of function sets in mixed HTTP/CoAP environments.</description>
