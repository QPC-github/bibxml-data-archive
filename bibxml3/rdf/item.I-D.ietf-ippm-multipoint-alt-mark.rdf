    <description>The Alternate Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can be applied only to point-to-point flows because it assumes that all the packets of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second node.  This document generalizes and expands this methodology to measure any kind of unicast flows, whose packets can follow several different paths in the network, in wider terms a multipoint-to-multipoint network.  For this reason the technique here described is called Multipoint Alternate Marking.</description>
