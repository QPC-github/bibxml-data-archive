    <title>"Construction of the Route Header Field in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-route-construct-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Route header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is used to cause a request to visit a set of hops on its way towards the final destination. Several specifications have defined rules for how a user agent obtains and then uses a set of Route header fields in the transmission of a request. These include the SIP specification itself, the Service-Route header field specification, the SIP server option in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and others. Unfortunately, these specifications are not consistent and the resulting behavior at clients and servers is not clear or complete. This document resolves this problem by defining a consistent set of logic, and in the process, serves as an update to the Service-Route specification.</description>
