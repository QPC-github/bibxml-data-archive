    <description>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can be described by URI Templates.  RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers through variable expansion."  This specification defines Template Descriptions, a schema and a media type that can be used to document and describe a URI Template by supporting descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with documentation (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine- oriented).  Template Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI Templates self- describing, without having to create their own representation.</description>
