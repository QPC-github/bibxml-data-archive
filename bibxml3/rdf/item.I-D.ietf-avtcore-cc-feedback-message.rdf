    <description>An effective RTP congestion control algorithm requires more fine- grained feedback on packet loss, timing, and ECN marks than is provided by the standard RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Report (SR) and Receiver Report (RR) packets.  This document describes an RTCP feedback message intended to enable congestion control for interactive real-time traffic using RTP.  The feedback message is designed for use with a sender-based congestion control algorithm, in which the receiver of an RTP flow sends RTCP feedback packets to the sender containing the information the sender needs to perform congestion control.</description>
