    <title>"Migrating SIP to IPv6 Media Without Connectivity Checks", Dan Wing, Andrew Yourtchenko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wing-dispatch-v6-migration-00.txt</link>
    <description>During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that an IPv6 path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpoints to not receive RTP data.  Connectivity checks would detect and avoid the user noticing such a problem, but there is industry reluctance to implement connectivity checks.  This document describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpoints to attempt communications over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6 path is not working.  The mechanism does not require connectivity checks.</description>
