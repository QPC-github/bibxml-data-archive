        <description>This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also known under the PMF methodology.  The methodology is based on the manifesto written by Zed A.  Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which describes a natural approach to software engineering with a strong focus on the act of programming.  The PMF methodology uses a soft naming to allow for a non-partisan reference to official engineering or project documents describing one of the most used software engineering methodologies.</description>
