    <title>"Making Multipath TCP robust for stateless webservers", Christoph Paasch, Anumita Biswas, Darren Haas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-paasch-mptcp-syncookies-02.pdf</link>
    <description>This document proposes a modification of the MPTCP handshake that allows it to work efficiently with stateless servers.  We first identify the issues around stateless connection establishment using SYN-cookies.  Further, we suggest an extension to Multipath TCP to overcome these issues and discuss alternatives.  As a side-effect, the proposed modification to the handshake opens the door to reduce the size of the MP_CAPABLE option in the SYN. This reduces the growing pressure on the TCP-option space in the SYN- segment, giving space for future extensions to TCP.</description>
