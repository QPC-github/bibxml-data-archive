    <title>"M-PIN FULL : Zero Knowledge two-Factor Authentication and Key Exchange", Michael Scott, Brian Spector, Stanislav Mihaylov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-scott-mpinfull-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this document, the M-PIN FULL protocol for two factor authentication and key exchange is described. This protocol mutually identifies a Client to a Server and the Server to the Client, and agrees between them a cryptographic strong encryption key for subsequent communication. M-PIN FULL requires an external Trusted Authority to issue secrets to participating Clients and Servers.</description>
