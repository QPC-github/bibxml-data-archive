    <description>This document describes requirements for collecting topology data from network elements and other sources, creating a coherent view of the network topology from the collected data, and presenting the topology view to various applications that need to: a) understand the topology; and, b) leverage topology information in order to improve application specific mechanisms such as path selection, resources reservation, etc.</description>
