    <description>This draft defines a method for optimized MAC Address Withdrawal in VPLS model 3 ([RFC4664]) supporting qualified learning ([RFC4762]). Some extensions are made based on the MAC Address Withdrawal procedures defined in [RFC4762] and [I-D.ietf-l2vpn-vpls-ldp-mac-opt], in order to enable a PE to remove only the MAC addresses, which belong to MAC address space affected by topology change.</description>
