    <description>This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks. It is assumed that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an external network interface and their internal network.  This document defines new ND options to allows a vehicle to announce the network prefixes and services inside its internal network to another vehicle or RSU.</description>
