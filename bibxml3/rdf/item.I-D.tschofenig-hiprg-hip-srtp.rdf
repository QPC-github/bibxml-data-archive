    <description>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol which adds a new layer between the traditional Transport and the Network layer. HIP is an end-to-end authentication and key exchange protocol, which supports security and mobility in a commendable manner. The HIP base specification is generalized and purported to support different key exchange mechanisms in order to provide confidentiality protection for the subsequent user data traffic. This draft explains a mechanism to establish Secure Real Time Protocol associations, to protect the user data packets, by using HIP.</description>
