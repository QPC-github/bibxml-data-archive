        <description>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to a domain, represented by a Registrar, using an intermediary node between Pledge and Registrar.  This intermediary node is known as a "constrained Join Proxy".  An enrolled Pledge can act as a Join Proxy.  This document extends the work of Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) by replacing the Circuit-proxy between Pledge and Registrar by a stateless/stateful constrained Join Proxy.  It relays join traffic from the Pledge to the Registrar.</description>
