        <description>Along as the adoption of TCP/IP in increasingly emerging scenarios, challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To still enable TCP/IP for networks that previously using exclusive protocols, a flexible address structure would be highly preferred for their particular properties.  This document describes well-recognized scenarios that typically require a flexible address structure, and states the requirements of such flexible address structure.</description>
