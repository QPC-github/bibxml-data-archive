    <title>"HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)", Hugo Krawczyk, Pasi Eronen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-krawczyk-hkdf-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a simple HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF) which can be used as a building block in various protocols and applications.  The KDF is intended to support a wide range of applications and requirements, and is conservative in its use of cryptographic hash functions.</description>
