    <description>This document is a guideline for Registries and Registrars on registering internationalized domain names (IDNs) based on (in alphabetical order) Bosnian, Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Kildin Sami, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian languages in a DNS zone.  For completeness of the "European" languages, it also discusses the additional characters needed for Moldovan when it is written in Cyrillic script.  It describes appropriate characters for registration and variant considerations for characters from Greek and Latin scripts with similar appearances and/or derivations.</description>
