    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP [RFC3261]) provides a mechanism for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.  This document describes a vulnerability of SIP combined with HTTP Digest Access Authentication [RFC2617] through which an attacker can leverage the victim's credentials to send authenticated requests on his behalf.  This attack is different from the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and does not require any eavesdropping, DNS or IP spoofing.</description>
