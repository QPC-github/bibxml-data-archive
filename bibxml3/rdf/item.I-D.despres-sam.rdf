    <title>"Scalable Multihoming across IPv6 Local-Address Routing Zones Global-Prefix/Local-Address Stateless Address Mapping (SAM)", Remi Despres</title>

    <description>The continuous growth of routing tables in the core of Internet is a challenge.  It would become overwhelming if each multihomed customer site would need a provider independent prefix to take full advantage of its multihoming.  IPv6 has the potential to solve this problem, but a complete specification is still missing.  This draft proposes an approach for a solution.  The Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) model, introduced for this, is applicable to a hierarchy of routing zones with multihoming permitted at each level, and with each zone using local addresses for its internal routing plan.  End-to-end transparency of the Internet is maintains across these local-address zones, thanks to a systematic encapsulation of global-address packets into local-address packets. Local addresses are statelessly derived from prefixes found in global addresses, and from static parameters of traversed zones.  Global prefixes delegated by a zone to its child interfaces can be obtained by autoconfiguration, thanks to to a bidirectional correspondence between SAM local addresses and SAM global prefixes.  Deployment can be incremental.</description>
