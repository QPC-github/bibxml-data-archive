    <description>This paper extends the Nemo Basic Support [10] for a Mobile Router to synchronize its Mobile Network Prefixes with its Home Agents and obtain new ones dynamically. The proposed prefix delegation mechanism is agnostic to the way the prefixes are managed and provisioned at the Home Agent; it might be used for bootstrapping, resynchronization at binding creation or after a loss of states (eg MR reboot), MNP Renumbering, and configuration checking for loop avoidance.</description>
