    <title>"Remote Call Control in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) using the REFER  method and the session-oriented dialog package", Cullen Jennings, Rohan Mahy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mahy-sip-remote-cc-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to use the SIP REFER method and the dialog package to manipulate conversations, dialogs, and sessions on remote User Agents. Specifically it extends the REFER mechanism to allow the specification of a response that a UA should send in a dialog. This functionality is most useful for collections of loosely coupled User Agents that wish to present a coordinated user experience. It does not require a Third-Party Call Control controller to be involved in any of the manipulated dialogs.</description>
