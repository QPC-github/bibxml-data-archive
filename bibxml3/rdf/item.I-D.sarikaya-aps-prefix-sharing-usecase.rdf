    <description>In case a given fixed network is policy converged with the mobile network, i.e if Policy for Convergence is deployed, host specific quality of service and charging can be applied to the hosts connecting using the wireless local area network access or some other means.  When local or visiting hosts are assigned their addresses using IPv6 prefix sharing, the edge router is unable to provide host specific quality of service and charging.  We explain both stateless and stateful address assignment cases.</description>
