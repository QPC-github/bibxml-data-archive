    <description>In order to resolve the problem of IP address shortage Internet society try hard and use or intend to use some technologies such as NAT/NAPT, IPv6. But the shortcoming or difficult deployment make it progress slowly. Here provides an extensible IP network realization method to exist IP version 4. Two-level extensible IP network architecture is adopted which includes public IP address domain and private IP address domain. With the position denotation of source IP node and destination IP node, IP datagram can progress through the whole extensible IP network freely using the source route based method.</description>
