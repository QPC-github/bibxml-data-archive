        <description>Service Function Chain architecture leads to more adaptive network nodes. It allows splitting the network function into fine-grained build blocks --- service function, and combining the network functions into service function chain to formulate complicated services. Further, the service function chain should be instantiated by selecting the optimal instance from the candidates for each service function in it. This document discusses the required components during the instantiation of service function chain in the network.</description>
