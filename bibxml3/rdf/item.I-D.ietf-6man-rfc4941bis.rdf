    <title>"Temporary Address Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6", Fernando Gont, Suresh Krishnan, Thomas Narten, Richard Draves</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-6man-rfc4941bis-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration that causes hosts to generate global scope addresses with randomized interface identifiers that change over time.  Changing global scope addresses over time limits the window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially perform address-based network activity correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions by the same host. Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication.  This document obsoletes RFC4941.</description>
