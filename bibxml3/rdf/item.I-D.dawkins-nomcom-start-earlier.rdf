    <title>"IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process: Revision of the  Nominating and Recall Committees Timeline", Spencer Dawkins</title>

    <description>RFC 3777 defines the Nominations and Recall Committee's operation, and includes a sample timeline for major steps in the NomCom process that meets the minimum normative requirements for the process. Recent NomComs have been scheduling based on the sample timeline, and the chairs of the last three NomComs, Danny McPherson (2004-2005), Ralph Droms (2005-2006), and Andrew Lange (2006-2007) have all reported that this timeline is very aggressive and have all suggested starting earlier. This document restructures the sample timeline, but makes no normative process changes.</description>
