        <description>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual. However, there are scenarios for which there is a need for a dynamic and efficient inter-subnet connectivity among these Tenant Systems and End Devices while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN.  This document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution based on EVPN to address such requirements.</description>
