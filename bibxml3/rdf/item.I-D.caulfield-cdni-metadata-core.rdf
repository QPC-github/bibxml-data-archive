    <description>The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to exchange content distribution metadata for the purpose of content acquisition and delivery.  The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content provides a downstream CDN with the information necessary for the downstream CDN to service content requests on behalf of an upstream CDN in accordance with the delivery policies defined by the upstream CDN.  This document describes the core set of CDNI metadata that all interconnected CDNs must support.</description>
