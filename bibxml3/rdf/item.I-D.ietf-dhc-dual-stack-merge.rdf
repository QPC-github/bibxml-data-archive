    <description>A node may have support for communications using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Such a node may wish to obtain both IPv4 and IPv6 configuration settings via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This can be done by using the IPv4 and the IPv6 DHC protocols respectively. This document considers mechanisms that allow such a node to make use of the configuration data from both protocols to obtain the desired common configuration.</description>
