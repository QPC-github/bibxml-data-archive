        <title>"Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel Configuration Attributes for Robust Block Transmission", Mohamed Boucadair, Jon Shallow</title>
        <dc:date>2021-06-29T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies new DOTS signal channel configuration parameters that are negotiated between DOTS peers to enable the use of Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options.  These options enable robust and faster transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet interchanges as well as supporting faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</description>
