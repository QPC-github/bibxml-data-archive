    <description>With the maturity of the EDI-INT standards of AS1, AS2 and AS3, applications and additional features are being built upon the basic secure transport functionality.  These features are not necessarily supported by all EDI-INT applications and could cause potential problems with implementations.  The EDIINT Features header provides a means to resolve these problems and support new functionality.</description>
