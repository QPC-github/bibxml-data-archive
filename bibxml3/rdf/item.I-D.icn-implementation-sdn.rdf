    <description>This document aims at discussing some research issues about the implementation of information-centric network (ICN) architectures. Towards this end, we first review the implementation methods employed by various ICNs and discuss the potential problems of these implementations.  Then we propose a unified framework for ICN implementation based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique which can facilitate the implementation of any ICN architecture and interoperability among different ICN architectures.</description>
