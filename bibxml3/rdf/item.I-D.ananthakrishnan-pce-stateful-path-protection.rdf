    <description>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) is capable of computing as well as controlling via Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (MPLS LSP).  Furthermore, it is also possible for a stateful PCE to create, maintain, and delete LSPs.  This document describes PCEP extension to associate two or more LSPs to provide end-to-end path protection.</description>
