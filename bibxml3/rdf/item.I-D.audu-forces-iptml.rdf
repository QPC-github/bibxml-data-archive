    <title>"Forwarding and Control Element Separation IP Transport Mapping Layer", Alex  Audu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-audu-forces-iptml-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the Forces-IPTML protocol that is designed to complement ForCES-PL (ForCES Protocol Layer) for communicating between Forwarding and Control Elements that make up a ForCEs-compliant network element, using IP transport technology (e.g. TCP/IP, SCTP/IP, UDP/IP). This protocol addresses all the requirements described in the Forces [0] requirements document. This document also specifies architectural attributes necessary in an implementation of Forces-IPTML to ensure correct and secure protocol operation.</description>
