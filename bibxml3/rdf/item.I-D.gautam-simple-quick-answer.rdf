    <description>In instant messaging system, it is useful to have some readily available IM (text, audio or video) which can be sent in case of the receiver is too busy to type/speak/record for a reply.  These short IM (here after referred as QA - Quick Answer) can be created, stored and used when needed.  This document defines a new QA content type and XML namespace that conveys QA between two entities.  The QAs are delivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as the instant messages themselves.</description>
