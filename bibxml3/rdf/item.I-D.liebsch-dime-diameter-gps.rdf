    <title>"Diameter General Purpose Session", Marco Liebsch, Gottfried Punz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liebsch-dime-diameter-gps-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Diameter protocol has specified and relies on the use of per-user sessions, which are established between a Diameter client and server during a user's authentication and authorization procedure.  This document proposes an extension to the Diameter session concept to establish a general purpose Diameter session for signaling the context of multiple users, such as for group handling or application state restoration.</description>
