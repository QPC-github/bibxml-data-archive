    <description>The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC Series.  This document applies specifically to the archivist role of the RFC Editor.  It provides guidance on when and how to preserve RFCs, and the tools required to view or re-create RFCs as necessary. This document also highlights where gaps are in the current process, and where compromises are suggested to balance cost with ideal best practice.</description>
