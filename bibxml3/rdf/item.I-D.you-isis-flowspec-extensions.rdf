    <description>Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced in the BGP protocol [RFC5575].  FlowSpec rules are used to distribute traffic filtering rules that are used to filter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.  For the networks that only deploy IS-IS or IS-IS variant, it is required that IS-IS is extended to distribute Flow Specification or FlowSpec rules.  This document discusses the use cases for distributing flow specification (FlowSpec) routes using IS-IS.  Furthermore, this document defines a new IS-IS FlowSpec Reachability TLV encoding format that can be used to distribute FlowSpec rules, its validation procedures for imposing the filtering information on the routers, and a capability to indicate the support of FlowSpec functionality.</description>
