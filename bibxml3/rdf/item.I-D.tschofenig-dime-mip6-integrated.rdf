    <description>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start utilizing Mobile IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these parameters are statically configured. Ongoing work aims to make this information dynamically available to the mobile node. An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is to support interworking with existing authentication, authorization and accounting infrastructure. This document defines a Diameter application to facilitate Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping for the integrated scenario.</description>
