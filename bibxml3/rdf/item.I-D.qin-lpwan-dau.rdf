    <description>Connecting LP-WANs(Low-Power Wide Area Networks) to the Internet is expected to provide significant benefits to these networks in terms of interoperability, application deployment, and management,among others.  However, the specific characteristics of LP-WANs, such as very limited data unit size, and large-scale data sets make the network operation more complex: using one IP packet to send one LP- WAN data unit is a waste of bandwidth(because the packet header is much bigger than payload), and the large-scale LP-WAN data sets can also increase the Internet burden.  This specification defines a Data Aggregation Unit(DAU) for LP-WANs to aggregate small-size date units into bigger data chains so they can be sent through the Internet more efficiently.</description>
