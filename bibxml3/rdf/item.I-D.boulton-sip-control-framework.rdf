    <title>"A Control Framework for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Chris  Boulton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boulton-sip-control-framework-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Framework and protocol for application deployment where the application logic and processing are distributed. The framework uses the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control mechanism between application servers and associated external servers such as media servers. The motivation for the creation of this Framework is to provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a distributed, centralized conference system, as defined by the XCON work group of the IETF. It is not, however, limited to this scope and it is envisioned that this generic Framework will be used for a wide variety of de-coupled control architectures between network entities.</description>
