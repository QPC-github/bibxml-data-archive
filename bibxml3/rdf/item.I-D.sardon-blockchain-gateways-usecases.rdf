        <description>In the past five years there has been a growing interest in using blockchains and DLT systems as a means to create a new mechanism to issue, distribute and manage virtual assets.  However, as DLT systems consisting of peer-to-peer (P2P) network of nodes increase in number, there is an increasing need to interconnect these networks to permit virtual assets to flow into and out of them.  This document captures a number of use-cases driving the need for interoperability between DLT systems.</description>
