    <title>"IKEv2-derived Shared Secret Key for O/TWAMP", Kostas Pentikousis, Emma Zhang, Yang Cui</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ippm-ipsec-11.txt</link>
    <description>The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanisms require that both the client and server endpoints possess a shared secret.  This document describes the use of keys derived from an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the shared key in O/TWAMP.  If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, O/TWAMP can support certificate-based key exchange, which would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency.  The key derivation presented in this document can also facilitate automatic key management.</description>
