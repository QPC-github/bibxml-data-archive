    <description>This document discusses the problem of long delays between connection establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including that in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Additionaly, it describes a modification to TCP's reaction to soft errors that has been implemented in a variety of TCP/IP stacks to help overcome this problem.</description>
