    <title>"Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes", Jozef Babiarz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-diffserv-service-classes-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv, recommends how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated Service Code Points (DSCP), traffic conditioners, Per- Hop Behaviors (PHB), and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class, but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply them consistently.</description>
