    <title>"An argument for encoding multiple media sources per m= section of SDP.", Peter Thatcher, Justin Uberti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pthatcher-mmusic-many-sources-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document explains why it is preferable to have multiple media sources encoded in SDP as one m= section rather than many m= sections, especially when there are a large number of video sources which change frequently and need dynamic resolution changes, such as in a video conferencing system.</description>
