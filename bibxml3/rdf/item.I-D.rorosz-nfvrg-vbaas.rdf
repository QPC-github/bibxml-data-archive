    <description>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) promises the delivery of flexible chaining of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with portability, elasticity, guaranteed performance, reliability among others.  Service providers expect similar behavior from NFV as their current appliances based infrastructure, however, with the ease and flexibility of operation and cost effectiveness.  Managing for predictable performance in virtualized environments is far from straightforward.  Considering resource provisioning, selection of an NFV Infrastructure Point of Presence to host a VNF or allocation of resources (e.g., virtual CPUs, memory) needs to be done over virtualized (abstracted and simplified) resource views.  In order to support orchestration decisions, we argue that a framework for VNF benchmarking is need.</description>
