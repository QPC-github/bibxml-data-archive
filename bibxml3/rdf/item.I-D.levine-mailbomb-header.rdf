    <title>"A Message Header to Identify Subscription Form Mail", John Levine</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levine-mailbomb-header-02.txt</link>
    <description>Many organizations have web forms that provoke an e-mail confirmation to the e-mail address provided in the form.  Malicious entities do bulk form submissions with forged addresses, resulting in mail floods to the holders of those addresses.  This document defines a message header to identify mail sent in response to web forms, so that recipient mail systems can better recognize and mitigate the mail floods.</description>
