    <title>"Using Device-provided Location-Related Measurements in Location Configuration Protocols", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom</title>

    <description>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location- related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  When a LIS generates location information for a Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the location estimate.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</description>
