    <title>"Push Notification with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Christer Holmberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-holmberg-sipcore-sip-push-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how push notification mechanisms can be used to wake up suspended Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs), in order to be able to receive and generate SIP requests.  The document defines new SIP URI parameters, that can be used in a SIP REGISTER request to provide push notification information from the SIP User Agent (UA) to the SIP entity (realized as a SIP proxy in this document) that will send a push request to the push server in order to trigger a push notification towards the SIP UA.</description>
