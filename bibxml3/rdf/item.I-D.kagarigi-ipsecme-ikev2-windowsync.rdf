    <description>IKEv2 and IPsec protocols are widely used for deploying VPN.  In order to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNs are implemented as IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster.  But there are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster.  The draft "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" enumerates all the issues encountered in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment.  This draft proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to solve main issues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in Hot Standby cluster and gives implementation advice for others.  The main issues to be solved are: o  IKE Message Id synchronization : This is done by obtaining the  message Id values from the peer and updating the values at the  newly active cluster member after the failover. o  IPsec SA Counter synchronization : This is done by sending  incremented the values of replay counters by the newly active  cluster member to the peer as expected replay counter value.</description>
