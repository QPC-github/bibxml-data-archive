    <description>The MPLS source routing mechanism developed by Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) WG can be leveraged to realize a unified source routing instruction which works across both IPv4 and IPv6 underlays in addition to the MPLS underlay.  The unified source routing instruction can be used to realize a transport-independent service function chaining by encoding the service function path information or service function chain information as an MPLS label stack.  This document describes how to advertise service functions and their corresponding attributes (e.g., service function label) using IS-IS.</description>
