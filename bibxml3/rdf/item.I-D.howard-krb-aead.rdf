    <description>This document updates RFC3961 to support encryption mechanisms that can authenticate associated data, such as Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).  These mechanisms are often more performant and need not expand the message as much as conventional modes.</description>
