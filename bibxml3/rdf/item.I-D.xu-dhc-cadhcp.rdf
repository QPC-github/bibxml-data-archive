    <title>"An Authentication Method based on Certificate for DHCP", Marcus Wong, Serge Manning, Yixian Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xu-dhc-cadhcp-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a technique that can provide both entity authentication and message authentication based on certificate.  This protocol combines three existing options, authentication option as specified in delay authentication mechanism in [RFC3118] and the user authentication protocol option defined in [RFC2485].  The goal of this specification is to define methods based certificate to protect the integrity of DHCP message and stop the gaps of the existing delay authentication mechanism.  In order to meet these goals, we use the asymmetrical cryptography protection and some options about authentication that have been defined in other specifications.</description>
