    <description>Xcast6 (Explicit Multi-unicast for IPv6) is a new multicast scheme that supports very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast6 sends data via optimal route without traffic redundancy when Xcast- aware routers exist; otherwise, data will be sent in daisy-chain form. In this document, we propose Xcast6 Treemap - an extension of Xcast6. Using Xcast6 Treemap, data can be branched not only at source but also at remote hosts, solving the limitation of daisy-chain connection. Xcast6 Treemap utilizes existing multicast infrastructure (Xcast-aware routers) to improve application performance and reduce traffic redundancy on network; also, it automatically switches to end-host multicast operation mode in the absence of Xcast-aware router. For widely deployment of Xcast6, routers must be upgraded gradually. This requires a long term strategy and Xcast6 Treemap is a good choice for incremental deployment.</description>
