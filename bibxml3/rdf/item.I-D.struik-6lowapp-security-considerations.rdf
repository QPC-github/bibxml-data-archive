    <title>"Security Architectural Design Considerations for Low-Power Wireless Sensor Networks", Rene Struik</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-struik-6lowapp-security-considerations-00.txt</link>
    <description>We discuss security architectural design considerations for general-purpose multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The security architecture fits extremely constrained wireless environments, such as sensor networks, while remaining uniform and general enough to fit any wireless network. The design is tailored towards low overall implementation cost, supports semi-automatic lifecycle management, including ease of installation and configuration, scalability, survivability, mobility, and is adaptable towards network topology changes and towards different trust models underlying network operations.</description>
