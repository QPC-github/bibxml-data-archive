    <description>With interface multihoming, Mobile Nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to multiple radio access networks.  This enables a network node such as the Local Mobility Anchor to distribute the application traffic to interfaces that can best serve them.  This document specifies a network-controlled protocol to handover application flows from one interface to another.  Such control could provide better experience for end users and better traffic management for network operators.</description>
