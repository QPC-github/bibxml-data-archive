    <title>"A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)", Stanislav Shalunov</title>

    <description>With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision. To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required. The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.</description>
