    <title>"Data Center use of Static Diffie-Hellman in TLS 1.3", Matthew Green, Ralph Droms, Russ Housley, Paul Turner, Steve Fenter</title>

    <description>Unlike earlier versions of TLS, current drafts of TLS 1.3 have instead adopted ephemeral-mode Diffie-Hellman and elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman as the primary cryptographic key exchange mechanism used in TLS.  This document describes an optional configuration for TLS servers that allows for the use of a static Diffie-Hellman private key for all TLS connections made to the server.  Passive monitoring of TLS connections can be enabled by installing a corresponding copy of this key in each monitoring device.</description>
