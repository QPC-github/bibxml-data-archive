    <description>Simultaneous Multi-Access (SMA), originally designed for MIPv6, expects to be ported to PMIPv6 to achieve flow binding. However, there are a lot of problems to adapt SMA to PMIPv6 due to different mechanisms of two mobility management protocol. This document analyzes issues of SMA and different multihoming scenarios in PMIPv6. A PMIPv6 system which allows a MN to share HNP across its interfaces is proposed and a SMA solution is designed for the modified PMIPv6 system. The solution supports flow-based routing and address-based routing simultaneously.</description>
