    <title>"Setup and Maintenance of Pseudowires using RSVP-TE", Rahul Aggarwal</title>

    <description>This document describes procedures for using Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for signaling Pseudowires (PWs). One motivation is the signaling of PW QoS. The other is the setup of a multi-hop PW, for example, to span multiple domains. RSVP-TE provides mechanisms for QoS signaling and these can be leveraged for signaling PW QoS. It also provides the ability to signal bi-directional MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP) with explicit routes. This can be used for signaling multi-hop PWs that require explicit routing. RSVP-TE also provides the ability to establish non- adjacent or targeted signaling sessions.</description>
