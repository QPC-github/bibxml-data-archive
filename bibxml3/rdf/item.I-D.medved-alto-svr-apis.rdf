    <description>ALTO servers require automated operation, where the topology of the underlying networks is incorporated into network maps automatically. In addition to the Client-to-Server API defined in the ALTO protocol document, two more standardized API are required: an API between the ALTO Server and networking nodes (e.g. routers), through which the ALTO Server can get topology information from the network, and an API between the ALTO Servers, through which they can exchange topology and status information between themselves.</description>
