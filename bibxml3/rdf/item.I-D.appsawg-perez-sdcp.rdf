    <description>This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia streaming in cases where streaming generation should be distributed to improve performance.  This is especially useful for Human-Things streams.  Usually, real time applications such as virtual reality generate a user-controlled multimedia streaming.  This is a time continuous data flux that could be divided spatially to distribute processing, memory or network resources.  This protocol does not describe streaming communication, but the control of each single streaming generation in a best-effort by many nodes or things.</description>
