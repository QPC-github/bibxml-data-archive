    <title>"State Machines for Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access  (PANA)", Yoshihiro Ohba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ohba-pana-statemachine-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the conceptual state machines for the Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA). The state machines consist of the PANA Client (PaC) state machine and the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) state machine. The two state machines show how PANA can interface to EAP state machines and can be implemented with supporting various features including separate NAP and ISP authentications, ISP selection and mobility optimization. The state machines and associated model are informative only. Implementations may achieve the same results using different methods.</description>
