    <title>"Lightweight Key Establishment and Management Protocol in Dynamic Sensor Networks (KEMP)", Ying Qiu, Jianying Zhou, F Bao</title>

    <description>When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wireless sensor network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routing path and neighborhood keep changing.  In order to provide a high level of security in this environment, the moving sensor node needs to be authenticated to new neighboring nodes as well as to establish a key for secure communication.  The document proposes an efficient and scalable protocol to establish and update the secure key in a dynamic wireless sensor network environment.  The protocol guarantees that two sensor nodes share at least one key with probability 1 (100%) with less memory and energy cost, while not causing considerable communication overhead.</description>
