    <title>"LOOPS Generic Information Set", Michael Welzl, Carsten Bormann</title>

    <description>LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local (not end-to-end but in-network) recovery of lost packets to achieve better data delivery in the presence of losses. [I-D.li-tsvwg-loops-problem-opportunities] provides an overview over the problems and optimization opportunities that LOOPS could address.  The present document is a strawman for the set of information that would be interchanged in a LOOPS protocol, without already defining a specific data packet format.  The generic information set needs to be mapped to a specific encapsulation protocol to actually run the LOOPS optimizations.  A companion document contains a sketch of a binding to the tunnel encapsulation protocol Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].</description>
