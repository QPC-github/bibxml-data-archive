    <title>"IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management", Fred Baker, Gorry Fairhurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baker-aqm-recommendation-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It presents a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management (AQM) in network devices, to improve the performance of today's Internet.  It also urges a concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.  The note largely repeats the recommendations of RFC 2309, updated after fifteen years of experience and new research.</description>
