    <description>This document is an implementation report for the BGP Link-State Information Distribution protocol.  The editors did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by respondents.  The respondents are experts with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are considered authoritative for the implementations for which their responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use the YES answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.</description>
