    <title>"Probing MPTCP Subflows", Mohamed Boucadair, Christian Jacquenet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-mptcp-probe-subflow-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to Multipath TCP (MPTCP) that is meant to assess whether a path used to establish a given subflow is MPTCP-friendly, i.e., intermediate nodes involved in that path do not alter nor strip MPTCP options, which would prevent the establishment of MPTCP communications along that path.  A new flag bit, called Probe Flag (P-flag) is defined for this purpose.  This document updates RFC6824.</description>
