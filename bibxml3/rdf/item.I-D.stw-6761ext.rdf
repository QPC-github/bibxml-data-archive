    <title>"Guidelines for Use of the Special Use Names Registry", Suzanne Woolf</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stw-6761ext-01.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 6761 requires that proponents document how a specific name is to be treated within the DNS protocol, public database, and administrative infrastructure, but doesn't provide any guidance to help the community figure out whether a particular registration is otherwise beneficial.  This limited guidance in RFC 6761 provides flexibility in standardizing the use of domain names in the modern Internet outside of conventional DNS protocol or the public DNS database.  This flexibility has been useful from time to time but has also caused significant confusion (see RFC 8244).  This document attempts to define guidelines for the IESG and the IETF community on the interpretation of RFC 6761 and the use of the special use names registry.</description>
