        <title>"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", Rakesh Gandhi, Colby Barth, Bin Wen</title>
        <dc:date>2021-02-21T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs), one in each direction in the network, into an Associated Bidirectional LSP.  These PCEP extensions can be applied using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC- Initiated LSPs, as well as when using a Stateless PCE.  The PCEP procedures defined are applicable to the LSPs using RSVP-TE for signaling.</description>
