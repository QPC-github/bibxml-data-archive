    <description>Current L2VPN implementations that use LDP for label binding require another protocol to dynamically detect which PEs belong to a given VPN. We herein propose a simple extension to LDP consisting of a message with which a PE announces its desire to join an existing VPN. The technique is equally applicable to HVPLS, multisegment VPLS and VPWS, and may be especially attractive for access networks employing MPLS.</description>
