    <description>MPLS Traffic engineering heavily relies on the correct simulation of traffic under normal and failure conditions.  Currently traffic simulations rely on RSVP TE or on SPF routing with ECMP.  SR introduces basically a new overlay on top of the L3 topology, the SR topology.  The SR-topology is demand dependant.  This document discusses issues, requirements and some solution approaches to combine Segment Routing and Traffic Engineering.</description>
