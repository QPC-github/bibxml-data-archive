    <description>In order to reach the goal of load sharing and traffic engineering in multihoming, there must be some mechanism for the local host to make a selection of the "best" source locator to used. Obviously the selection includes the objective to select a currently viable path. What's more, it also includes the objective to select a path with larger bandwidth, which is more difficult to judge than reachability. In this memo, we propose a simple mechanism to determine the availability and bandwidth condition between a multihomed host and its ISP. It will help to share the load among multiple paths and provide better performance for the host's traffic. This mechanism could be part of traffic engineering functions, which could be used as the basis of locator selection before initial session establishment and aslo could be used to trigger locator swithes to avoid loss of connectivity, long delay or large loss rate.</description>
