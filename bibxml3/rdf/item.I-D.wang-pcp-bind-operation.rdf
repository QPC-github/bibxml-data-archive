    <description>Port Control Protocol[PCP, RFC6887] describes two opcodes between PCP client and PCP server: PCP map opcode and PCP peer opcode. These two opcodes are used mainly for the establishment of map table in NAT devices, to let the incoming packet pass through the NAT devices, reach to the server behind it (map opcode); or build the required map table explicitly in NAT devices (peer opcode). These opcodes are enough for the client-server communication model in general NAT environment, but for client-client communication model, especially that in symmetric NAT environment or in situation that two communication hosts are in different address family, there must exists one relay device, which act the same as PCP server, to forward the communication data. To control the behavior of relay device (similar as PCP server), build the communication channel between two ends via it and open its data forward capability to the third-party partner, it is needed to define one new opcode for PCP protocol.  The PCP BIND opcode will bind two communication channels which are ended at PCP server together and make the communication between two hosts behind the symmetric NAT environment, or that between two hosts belong to different address family possible. Such solution is simpler than the current procedures used by TURN.</description>
