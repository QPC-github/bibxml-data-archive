    <description>Call recording is an important feature in enterprise telephony applications.  Some industries such as financial traders have requirements to record all calls in which customers give trading orders.  This poses a particular problem for Secure RTP systems as many SRTP key exchange mechanisms do not disclose the SRTP session keys to intermediate SIP proxies.  As a result, these key exchange mechanisms cannot be used in environments where call recording is needed.  This document specifies a secure mechanism for a cooperating endpoint to disclose its SRTP master keys to an authorized party to allow secure call recording.</description>
