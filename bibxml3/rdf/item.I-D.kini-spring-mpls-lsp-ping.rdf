    <title>"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Data Plane Failures in Source Routed LSPs", Sriganesh Kini, Hannes Gredler</title>

    <description>MPLS has defined mechanisms for fault detection and isolation and mechanisms for reliably sending an echo reply in RFC 4379.  Source routed MPLS LSPs are a technique being proposed to address new use- cases.  This document describes how mechanisms defined for MPLS fault detection and isolation can be applied for source routed LSPs.</description>
