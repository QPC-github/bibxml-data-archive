    <title>"PCEP Extensions for service segment used in Segment Routing", Dhruv Dhody, Qin Wu</title>

    <description>Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms where a source node can choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop signaling.  This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate SR-TE paths that also have a local service segments involved.</description>
