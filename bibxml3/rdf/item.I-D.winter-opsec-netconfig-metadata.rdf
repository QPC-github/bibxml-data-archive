    <title>"A Configuration File Format for Network Services on Leaf Devices", Stefan Winter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-winter-opsec-netconfig-metadata-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a YANG module for transfering configuration information of deployments of network services towards leaf nodes (hosts) on the internet.  Such configuration files are meant to be discovered, consumed and used by configuration agents on the host to achieve correct and secure setup of these services on the consuming device.  This iteration of the I-D concentrates on Wi-Fi network setup and EAP credentials, but is extensible to cover a wide range including VPN, E-Mail and other services.</description>
