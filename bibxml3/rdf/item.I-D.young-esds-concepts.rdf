    <description>This document is intended to seed discussion about the Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS), an application layer protocol for the distributed sharing and discovery of notification events between associated partners within a supply chain.  Specified initially as a web service interface, the protocol defines event tracking and tracing operations as well as core object management operations.  This document obsoletes "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service Concepts draft-young-esds-concepts-03".  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at esds@ietf.org and/or the author(s).</description>
