        <description>There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical Software-Defined Networking (SDN) context, where the topology information provided by a Traffic Engineering (TE) network provider may be insufficient for its client to perform end-to-end path computation. In these cases the client would need to request the provider to calculate some (partial) feasible paths.  This document defines a YANG data model for a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to request path computation. This model complements the solution, defined in RFC YYYY, to configure a TE tunnel path in "compute-only" mode.  [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf-teas-yang-te once it has been published.  Moreover this document describes some use cases where a path computation request, via YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF), can be needed.</description>
