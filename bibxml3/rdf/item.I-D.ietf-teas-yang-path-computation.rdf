        <description>There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical Software-Defined Networking (SDN) context, where the topology information provided by a Traffic Engineering (TE) network provider may be insufficient for its client to perform multi-domain path computation.  In these cases the client would need to request the TE network provider to compute some intra-domain paths.  This document defines a YANG data model which contains Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to request path computation.  This model complements the solution, defined in RFC YYYY, to configure a TE tunnel path in "compute-only" mode.  [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf-teas-yang-te once it has been published.  Moreover, this document describes some use cases where the path computation request, via YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF), can be needed.</description>
