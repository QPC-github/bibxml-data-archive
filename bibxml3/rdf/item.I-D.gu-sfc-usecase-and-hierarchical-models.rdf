    <description>In providing the service functions such as VPN, FW, LB, DPI and so on, usecase and hierarchical models in cloud datacenters are introduced.In order to realize the practical deployment,the cascade and hang-on network architecture are comparied to make the guidance.By adopting the hang-on network architecture and the hierarchical models, services to the tenants are more flexible and elastic while services to the operators are more convenient in management.</description>
