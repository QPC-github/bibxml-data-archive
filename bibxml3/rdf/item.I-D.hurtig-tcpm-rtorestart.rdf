    <title>"TCP and SCTP RTO Restart", Per Hurtig, Andreas Petlund, Michael Welzl</title>

    <description>This document describes a modified algorithm for managing the TCP and SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when a connection's amount of outstanding data is small.  The modification allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer more aggressively in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used. This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that are short-lived or application-limited.</description>
