    <description>This draft describes the transport encapsulation to carry Network Service Header (NSH) over UDP transport protocol.  This enables applications and services using NSH to communicate over a simple layer-3 network without topological constraints.  It brings down the barrier to deploy NSH by not requiring additional overhead as is typical of overlay encapsulation mechanisms designed on top of UDP.  As a first benefit, this method eases the deployment of Service Function Chaining (SFC) by allowing SFC components to utilize the basic UDP/IP stack available in virtually all network elements and end systems to setup the virtual network and realize Service Function Chains (SFCs).</description>
