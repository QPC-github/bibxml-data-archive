        <title>"Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in Segment Routing Networks with IPv6 Data plane (SRv6)", Zafar Ali, Clarence Filsfils, Satoru Matsushima, Dan Voyer, Mach Chen</title>

        <description>This document describes how the existing IPv6 mechanisms for ping and traceroute can be used in an SRv6 network.  The document also specifies the OAM flag in the Segment Routing Header (SRH) for performing controllable and predictable flow sampling from segment endpoints.  In addition, the document describes how a centralized monitoring system performs a path continuity check between any nodes within an SRv6 domain.</description>
