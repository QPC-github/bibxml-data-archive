    <description>This document describes how the authors developed a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)-based NETCONF client and server.  When SOAP is used as a transport protocol for NETCONF, various kinds of development tools are available.  By making full use of these tools, developers can significantly reduce their workload.  The authors developed an NMS (Network Management System) and network equipment that can deal with NETCONF messages sent over SOAP.  This document aims to provide NETCONF development guidelines gained from the experience of implementing a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.</description>
