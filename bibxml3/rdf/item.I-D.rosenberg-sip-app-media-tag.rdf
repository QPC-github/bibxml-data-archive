    <title>"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Media Feature Tag for MIME Application Sub-Types", Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-app-media-tag-04.txt</link>
    <description>The caller preferences specification for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a caller to express preferences that the call be routed to a User Agent (UA) with particular capabilities. Similarly, a specification exists to allow a UA to indicate its capabilities in a registration.  Amongst those capabilities are the type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME types.  The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range of stream types, and provides insufficient granularity as a capability.  This specification allows a UA to indicate which application sub-types the agent supports.</description>
