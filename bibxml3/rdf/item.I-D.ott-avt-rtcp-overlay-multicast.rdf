    <description>The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is designed to   operate along with Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in unicast, single-source multicast and any-source multicast environments.  With the availability of overlay multicast and Application Layer Multicast (ALM), the suitability of RTCP in such environments needs to be analyzed.  The applicability of the existing RTCP reporting architectures in overlay multicast and ALM environments are investigated and the new features that may be required are discussed in this document.</description>
