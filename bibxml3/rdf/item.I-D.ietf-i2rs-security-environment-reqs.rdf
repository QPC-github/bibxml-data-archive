    <description>This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of the protocol used for I2RS.  The security environment requirements are the good security practices to be used during implementation and deployment of the code related to the new interface to routing system (I2RS) so that I2RS implementations can be securely deployed and operated.  Environmental security requirements do not specify the I2RS protocol seecurity requirements.  This is done in another document (draft- ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements).</description>
