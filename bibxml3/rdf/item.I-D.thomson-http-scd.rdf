    <title>"An Architecture for Secure Content Delegation using HTTP", Martin Thomson, Goran Eriksson, Christer Holmberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-http-scd-02.txt</link>
    <description>An architecture is described for content distribution using a secondary server that might be operated with reduced privileges. This architecture allows a primary server to delegate the responsibility for delivery of the payload of an HTTP response to a secondary server.  The secondary server is unable to modify this content.  The content is encrypted, which in some cases will prevent the secondary server from learning about the content.</description>
