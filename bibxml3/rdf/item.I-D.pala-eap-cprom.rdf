    <title>"Credentials Provisioning and Management via EAP (EAP-CPROM)", Massimiliano Pala</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pala-eap-cprom-00.txt</link>
    <description>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network access, the need for a standard credentials provisioning layer is paramount.  In particular, since EAP is deployed for authentication needs, the authors extend this use-case by including support for provisioning and management of credentials.  In particular, this specification defines how to support the provisioning of strong credentials to users and/or devices without the need for providing IP connectivity.  The use of EAP not only for provisiong but also for managing network credentials provides a general conduit that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired and WiFi networks credentials management).</description>
