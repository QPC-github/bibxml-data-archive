    <description>RFC Ed. : This draft refers to itself with RFC YYYY.  When this draft is published as an RFC, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "YYYY" (in the RFC, including the MIB module part) with the assigned RFC number and to remove this note.  This draft also refers to draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv4-proto.  When this draft is published as an RFC, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv4-proto" (in the RFC, including the MIB module part) with "RFC ZZZZ" (where ZZZZ is the assigned RFC number) and to remove this note.  The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations and other networked equipment.  As time synchronization is more and more a mission critical service, standardized means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are required to allow operators of such a service to setup a monitoring system that is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity of such a network participant and it is part of the NTP Version 4 standardization effort.</description>
