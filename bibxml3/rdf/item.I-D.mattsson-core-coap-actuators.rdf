    <description>Being able to trust information from sensors and to securely control actuators are essential in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world.  In this memo we show that just using COAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough.  We describe several serious attacks any on-path attacker can do, and discusses tougher requirements and mechanisms to mitigate the attacks.  While this document is focused on actuators, some of the attacks apply equally well to sensors.</description>
