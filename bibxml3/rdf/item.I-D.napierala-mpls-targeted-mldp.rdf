    <title>"Using LDP Multipoint Extensions on Targeted LDP Sessions", Maria Napierala, Eric Rosen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-napierala-mpls-targeted-mldp-03.txt</link>
    <description>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  The existing specification for this functionality assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors are directly connected. However, the LDP base specification allows for the case where a pair of LDP neighbors are not directly connected; the LDP session between such a pair of neighbors is known as a "Targeted LDP" session.  This document specifies the use of the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions over a Targeted LDP session.</description>
