    <description>This document specifies the gateway architecture for the interoperability between 6LoWPAN and external IPv6 networks. The gateway does the compression and decompression of IPv6 packets and performs the mapping between 16 bit short addresses and the IPv6 addresses for both the external IPv6 networks and 6LowPAN, respectively.</description>
