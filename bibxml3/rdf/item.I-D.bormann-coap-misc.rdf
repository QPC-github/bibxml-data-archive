    <description>This short I-D makes a number of partially interrelated proposals how to solve certain problems in the CoRE WG's main protocol, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  The current version has been resubmitted to keep information about these proposals available; the proposals are not all fleshed out at this point in time.</description>
