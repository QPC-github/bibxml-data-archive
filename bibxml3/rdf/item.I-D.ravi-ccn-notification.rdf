    <description>This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for CCN.  Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or multicast to multiple listening points.  Notifications do not expect a Content Object response hence only requires the use of FIB state in the CCN forwarder.  Emulating Notification as a PULL has performance and forwarding implications.  The draft proposes a new fixed header primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using Content Object primitive to transport Notifications.  These discussions are presented in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.</description>
