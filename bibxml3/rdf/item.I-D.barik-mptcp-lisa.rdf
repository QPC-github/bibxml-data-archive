    <description>This document describes the LISA (Linked Slow-Start Algorithm) for Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  Currently during slow-start, subflows behave like independent TCP flows making MPTCP unfair to cross-traffic and causing more congestion at the bottleneck.  This also yields more losses among the MPTCP subflows.  LISA couples the initial windows (IW) of MPTCP subflows during the initial slow-start phase to remove this adverse behavior.</description>
