    <description>We present TCP-over-UDP (ToU), an instance of TCP on top of UDP.  It provides exactly the same congestion control, flow control, reliability, and extension mechanisms as offered by TCP.  It is intended for use in scenarios where applications running on two hosts may not be able to establish a direct TCP connection but are able to exchange UDP packets.</description>
