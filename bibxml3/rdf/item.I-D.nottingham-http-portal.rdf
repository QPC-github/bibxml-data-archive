    <title>"The Network Authentication Required HTTP Status Code", Mark Nottingham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nottingham-http-portal-02.txt</link>
    <description>"Captive portals" are a commonly-deployed means of obtaining access credentials and/or payment for a network.  This memo introduces a new HTTP status code as a means of addressing issues found in these deployments.  This memo should be discussed on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list, although it is not a work item of the HTTPbis WG.</description>
