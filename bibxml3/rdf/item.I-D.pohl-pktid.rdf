    <title>"Use of IPFIX for Export of Per-Packet Information", Guido Pohl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pohl-pktid-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing per-packet information. The main idea is to export two types of records per flow: the first one contains the usual flow information plus a unique flow identifier while the other one consists of the actual per-packet information plus a flow identifier that refers to the flow the specific packet belongs to -- that means the flow identifier is used to associate the packet data to its corresponding flow.</description>
