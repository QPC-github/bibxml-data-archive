    <title>"Fault Tolerant Support for The Multihomed MN in Proxy Mobile IPv6", Haisheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jiang-netext-ft-pmip-00.txt</link>
    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. If the multihomed MN attaches to multiple MAGs by multiple links, then the mobility session in each link is independent. As the ongoing communication interface breaking down, the mobility session in the link is also broke and the traffic packets are lost. This document mainly proposes a fault tolerant scheme. When an interface of the multihomed MN broke down, the fault tolerant scheme can be used to handover the interface and realize the flow migration and maintain the integrity of data transmission During the handover process.</description>
