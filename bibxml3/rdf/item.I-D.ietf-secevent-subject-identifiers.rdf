        <description>Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may support a variety of identifiers to identify subjects related to the event. This specification formalizes the notion of subject identifiers as structured information that describe a subject, and named formats that define the syntax and semantics for encoding subject identifiers as JSON objects.  It also defines a registry for defining and allocating names for such formats, as well as the "sub_id" JSON Web Token (JWT) claim.</description>
