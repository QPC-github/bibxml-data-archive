    <title>"Network Mobility Route Optimization Requirements for Operational Use in  Aeronautics and Space Exploration Mobile Networks", Wesley Eddy, Will Ivancic, Terry Davis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mext-aero-reqs-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the requirements and desired properties of Network Mobility (NEMO) Route Optimization techniques for use in global networked communications systems for aeronautics and space exploration.  Substantial input to these requirements was given by aeronautical communications experts outside the IETF, including members of the International Civil Aviation Orgnanization (ICAO) and other aeronautical communications standards bodies.</description>
