    <description>Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) supports the inter- chassis redundancy mechanism which achieves high network availability.  In this document, the PEs in a Redundant Group (RG) running ICCP are used to offer multi-homed connectivity to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) networks. The ICCP TLVs for the STP application are defined, therefore PEs from the RG can make use of these TLVs to synchronize the state and configuration data of the STP network.</description>
