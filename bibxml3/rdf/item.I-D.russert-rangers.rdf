    <description>Routing and Addressing in Networks with Global Enterprise Recursion (RANGER) [RFC5720] provides an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing.  It provides an incrementally deployable approach for scalability, provider independence, mobility, multihoming, traffic engineering and security.  This document describes a series of use cases in order to showcase the architectural capabilities.  It further shows how the RANGER architecture restores the network-within-network principles originally intended for the sustained growth of the Internet.</description>
