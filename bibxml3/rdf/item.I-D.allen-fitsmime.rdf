    <description>This document describes the registration of the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) sub-types to be used by the international astronomical community for the interchange of FITS files. The encoding is defined by the published FITS standard documents. The FITS format has been in use since 1979, and almost all data from astronomical observations are interchanged using FITS.</description>
