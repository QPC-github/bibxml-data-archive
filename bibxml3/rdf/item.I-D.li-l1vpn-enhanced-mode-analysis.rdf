    <description>This document presents detailed information with respect to the four sub-models of the Layer One Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) enhanced mode. Each sub-model is evaluated from different points of view, such as Topology Confidentiality, scalability, and reliability. The requirements on GMPLS to support each sub-model of the L1VPN enhanced mode are also discussed in this document.</description>
