    <title>"Opportunistic Security as a Countermeasure to Pervasive Monitoring", Stephen Kent</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kent-opportunistic-security-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns about "pervasive monitoring" (PM) as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass-attack].  It begins by describing the current criteria (discussed at the STRINT workshop [STRINT]) for addressing concerns about PM.  It then examines terminology that has been used in IETF standards (and in academic publications) to describe encryption and key management techniques, with a focus on authentication vs. anonymity.  Based on this analysis, it propose a new term, "opportunistic security" to describe a goal for IETF security protocols, one countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.</description>
