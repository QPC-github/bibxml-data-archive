    <description>This document discusses policy concepts for management of Quality of Services (QoS) of applications in heterogeneous Internet environment. A framework is given for definitions of policies for configuration and automated adaptation of network resources, application transport parameters and QoS measurement scenarios dependent on the capabilities of heterogeneous access networks. Currently, the IETF QoS policy work is aimed at "specifying and representing policies that administer, manage and control access to network QoS resources" based on DiffServ and IntServ technologies [5]. To enhance this model, policies for management of QoS of heterogeneous network infrastructures are proposed in this document. Based on the capabilities of heterogeneous access networks, the QoS policies for heterogeneous environment allow dynamic configuration and adaptation of network resource reservations, application transport parameters and QoS measurement scenarios. The policies are defined for different actors, such as users, application service providers and network operators. The hierarchical policy management is based on rules specifying adaptation of parameters of policies of actors with hierarchical relationships.</description>
