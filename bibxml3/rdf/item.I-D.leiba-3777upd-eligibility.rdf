    <title>"Update to RFC 3777 to Clarify Nominating Committee Eligibility of IETF Leadership", Barry Leiba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-leiba-3777upd-eligibility-06.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may not volunteer to serve on the nominating commitee".  Since the time that document was written the IAOC was formed, and that body is not covered by RFC 3777.  There is also uncertainty in RFC 3777 about whether ex-officio members and liaisons are included as "sitting members".  This document updates RFC 3777 to clarify the rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the IESG, and the IAOC.</description>
