    <description>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) functionality in VPLS access. PBB has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008, which is an amendment to 802.1Q to improve the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This document describes different interoperability scenarios where IEEE 802.1ah functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances. The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS with existing IEEE 802.1ad (aka QinQ) Ethernet access and interoperability among them. Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which PBB functionality can be incorporated into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access.</description>
