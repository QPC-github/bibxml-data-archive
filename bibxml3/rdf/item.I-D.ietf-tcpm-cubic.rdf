    <description>CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards.  It differs from the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm in the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long distance networks.  CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as default by Linux and have been used for many years.  This document provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third party implementations and to solicit the community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.</description>
