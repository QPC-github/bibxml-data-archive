    <description>This document describes requirements for a protocol to negotiate a security context for SIP-signaled SRTP media.  In addition to the natural security requirements, this negotiation protocol must interoperate well with SIP in certain ways.  A number of proposals have been published and a summary of these proposals is in the appendix of this document.</description>
