    <title>"Security Threats and Requirements for Emergency Call Marking and Mapping", Henning Schulzrinne</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-taylor-ecrit-security-threats-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document reviews the security threats associated with the two current work items of the ECRIT Working Group. The first is the marking of signalling messages to indicate that they are related to an emergency. The second is the process of mapping from locations to Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) pointing to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). This mapping occurs as part of the process of routing emergency calls through the IP network. Based on the threats, this document establishes a set of security requirements for the the mapping protocol and for the handling of emergency-marked calls.</description>
