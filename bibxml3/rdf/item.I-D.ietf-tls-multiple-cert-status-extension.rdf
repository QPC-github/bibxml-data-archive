    <title>"The TLS Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension", Yngve Pettersen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-multiple-cert-status-extension-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Certificate Status Version 2 Extension to allow clients to specify and support several certificate status methods.  (The use of the Certificate Status extension is commonly referred to as "OCSP stapling".)  Also defined is a new method based on the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) that servers can use to provide status information not just about the server's own certificate, but also the status of intermediate certificates in the chain.</description>
