    <title>"Additional ECC Groups For IKE and IKEv2", Daniel R. L. Brown</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipsec-ike-ecc-groups-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes additional elliptic curve groups for use in IKE (as defined in RFC 2409) and IKEv2 (as defined in RFC 3406). These groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, and in addition, many of them provide higher strength than the previousley defined Oakley groups.</description>
