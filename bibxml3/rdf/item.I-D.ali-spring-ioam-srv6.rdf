        <description>OAM and PM information from the SR endpoints can be piggybacked in the data packet.  The OAM and PM information piggybacking in the data packets is also known as In-situ OAM (IOAM). IOAM records operational and telemetry information in the data packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported as part of the Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) header.</description>
