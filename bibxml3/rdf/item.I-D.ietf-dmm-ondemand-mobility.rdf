    <description>Applications differ with respect to whether they need session continuity and/or IP address reachability.  The network providing the same type of service to any mobile host and any application running on the host yields inefficiencies, as described in [RFC7333].  This document defines a new concep of enabling applications to influence the network's mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address reachability) on a per-Socket basis, and suggests extensions to the networking stack's API to accomodate this concept.</description>
