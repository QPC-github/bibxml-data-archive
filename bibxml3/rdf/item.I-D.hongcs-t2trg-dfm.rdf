    <description>Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increased the use of sensing technologies for IoT applications. However, monitoring sensor nodes is still a challenging issue in distributed remote environments, especially wireless environments. Different from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog Computing becomes an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node can control and monitor its subdomain's devices and perform aggregation tasks to support the central server at the cloud. Since node fault detection can strongly affect the performance and accuracy in most IoT analysis applications, fault detection mechanism should be integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, these fault nodes could be detected and replaced by others available nodes in the same domain for the analysis by a distributed fault detection and node replacement mechanism based on their sensory values in a considered domain.</description>
