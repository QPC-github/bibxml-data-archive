    <description>Label Switched Path Ping (LSP-Ping) is an existing and widely deployed Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  This document describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP- Ping can be used for On-demand Connectivity Verification of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) LSPs and Pseudowires.  This document also clarifies procedures to be used for processing the related OAM packets.  Further, it describes procedures for using LSP-Ping to perform Connectivity Verification and Route Tracing functions in MPLS-TP networks.  Finally this document updates RFC 4379 by adding a new address type and requesting an IANA registry.</description>
