    <description>Mapping Services in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks are key to proper LISP forwarding operation.  When considering the deployment of LISP at large scale, these Mapping Services are even more crucial for the sake of the LISP forwarding efficiency.  This document introduces two additional LISP messages that are meant to facilitate the dynamic discovery of Mapping Systems, improve Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITR) recovery times and optimize the solicitation of the LISP Mapping System as a function of the ITR location, in particular.</description>
