    <title>"Problem Statement for Heterogeneous Handover", Ashutosh Dutta</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ohba-mobopts-heterogeneous-requirement-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the problem statement and a set of issues and requirement specific to heterogeneous handover. Careful consideration needs to be given to these set of requirements while designing an optimized handover framework in a heterogeneous mobility scenario. These problem statements help determine the key functions that are responsible for delay during handover involving interdomain and heterogeneous access technology. Analysis of these issues and requirements can be applied to any existing mobility optimization framework.</description>
