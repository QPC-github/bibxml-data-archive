    <description>TRILL routing can be extended to support multiple levels by building on the multilevel feature of IS-IS routing. Depending on how nicknames are managed, there are two primary alternatives to realize TRILL multilevel: the unique nickname approach and the aggregated nickname approach as discussed in [MultiL]. This document specifies the unique nickname approach. This approach gives unique nicknames to all TRILL switches across the multilevel TRILL campus.</description>
