    <description>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of network applications and the network service in handling user data. This performance data provides information essential in validating service level agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings of network greater problems.  This document describes a generic methodology for calculating metrics related to network based applications.  In addition, to the performance metrics, several additional information elements are included to help provide greater context to the reports.  The measurements use audio/video applications as base examples but are not restricted to these class of applications.</description>
