    <title>"Configuring the Differentiated Services Codepoint of Session Description  Protocol Established Media Streams", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-mmusic-dscp-attribute-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model currently has no mechanism for dynamic configuration of the Differentiated Services Codepoints (DSCP) for the media streams endpoints establish.  This document creates such a mechanism within SDP, as granular as at the media stream level where more than one stream can be in an offer/answer exchange, to set a particular DSCP for the desired Per Hop Behavior (PHB) of a media stream. This same mechanism can change a DSCP of an existing stream based on dynamic network conditions.</description>
