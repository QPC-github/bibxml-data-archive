    <title>"Dimensioning considerations for distributed mobility architecture", Elena Demaria, Loris Marchetti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-demaria-dmm-dimensioning-considerations-00.txt</link>
    <description>One of the main questions posed during recent discussions on distributed mobility architectures is if the distributed architecture can have advantages in terms of costs with respect to a centralized one.  This draft describes a general method to calculate the costs of the centralized and distributed scenarios.  Even if a simplified model has been used, some information can be earned.  Each operator can use this model and his own costs to discover the optimal architecture based on traffic observed in the network.</description>
