    <description>This document presents a mechanism aimed at providing a solution for network slicing in the transport network for 5G services.  The proposed mechanism uses a unified administrative instance identifier to distinguish different virtual network resources for both intra- domain and inter-domain network slicing scenarios.  Combined with the segment routing technology, the mechanism could be used for both best-effort and traffic engineered services for tenants.</description>
