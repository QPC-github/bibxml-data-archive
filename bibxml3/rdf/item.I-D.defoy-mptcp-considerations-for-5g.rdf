    <description>This document describes scenarios where the behavior of the 5G mobility management framework is different from earlier cellular generations, and describes how it may benefit from some form of adaptation of MPTCP implementations and protocol aspects in the 5G system.  This document also describes how MPTCP may be leveraged in 5G system specifications.</description>
