    <description>In many circumstances public LoST servers or a distributed network of forest guides linking public LoST servers is not available.  In such environments the general ECRIT calling models breakdown.  However, location servers operating in these areas are often privy to the necessary information to reach emergency and other services.  This document describes a solution where by the routing information may be obtained from a location server using a simple extension to the HELD protocol.</description>
