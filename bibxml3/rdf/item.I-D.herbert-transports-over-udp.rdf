    <description>This specification defines a mechanism to encapsulate layer 4 transport protocols over UDP. Such encapsulation facilitates deployment of alternate transport protocols or transport protocol features on the Internet. DTLS can be employed to encrypt the encapsulated transport header in a packet thus minimizing the exposure of transport layer information to the network and so promoting the end-to-end networking principle. Transport connection identification can be disassociated from network location (IP addresses) to provide connection persistence for mobility and across state eviction in NAT.</description>
