    <title>"Signaling for Inverse Multiplexing Schemes via GMPLS using RSVP-TE", Evelyne Roch, Jonathan Sadler</title>

    <description>A set of requirements and a proposed implementation for the control of the SONET/SDH inverse multiplexing capabilities known as VCAT/LCAS is given in [CCAMP-VCAT]. However, implementations based on OIF implementation agreements and their prototype extensions have identified gaps in [CCAMP-VCAT]. This draft proposes a wider scoped alternative implementation approach that addresses the requirements of [CCAMP-VCAT] and additional requirements of independent setup of the VCAT group and its members.</description>
