    <title>"PASSporT SHAKEN Extension (SHAKEN)", Chris Wendt, Mary Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-stir-passport-shaken-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved in communications.  The extension is defined, corresponding to the SHAKEN specification, to provide both a specific set of levels-of- confidence in the correctness of the originating identity for a SIP based Communication Service Provider (CSP) telephone network originated call as well as an identifier that allows the CSP to uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network.</description>
