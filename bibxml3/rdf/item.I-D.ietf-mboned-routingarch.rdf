    <description>This document describes multicast routing architectures that are currently deployed on the Internet. This document briefly describes those protocols and references their specifications. This memo also reclassifies to Historic several older RFCs. These RFCs describe multicast routing protocols that were never widely deployed or have fallen into disuse.</description>
