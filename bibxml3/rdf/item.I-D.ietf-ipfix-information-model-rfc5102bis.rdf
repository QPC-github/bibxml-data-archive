    <title>"Information Model for IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX)", Benoit Claise, Brian Trammell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipfix-information-model-rfc5102bis-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the datatypes and management policy for the information model for the IP Flow Information eXport (IPFIX) protocol. This information model is maintained as the IANA IPFIX Information Element Registry, the initial contents of which were defined by RFC 5102. This information model is used by the IPFIX Protocol for encoding measured traffic information and information related to the traffic Observation Point, the traffic Metering Process, and the Exporting Process. Although developed for the IPFIX Protocol, the model is defined in an open way that easily allows using it in other protocols, interfaces, and applications. This document obsoletes RFC 5102.</description>
