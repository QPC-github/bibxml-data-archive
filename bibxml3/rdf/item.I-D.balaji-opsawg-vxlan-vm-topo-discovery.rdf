    <description>This document proposes a method by which in a VXLAN environment the ARP tables of each VTEP having an active VM belonging to a particular tenant where such active VMs are distributed amongst several VTEPs in a data center or across data centers are walked through and the collation of the location of such active VMs and the VTEPs they are located in is found for management and network resource planning purposes.</description>
