    <description>This document intends to find out the size of an IP packet at which VoIP applications will produce the best result. It emphasizes the physical phenomenon because of which ATM networks perform better than the IP switch based networks and tries to come out with an approach by which IP switch based network can perform as good as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.</description>
