    <title>"Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and  Aggregation Plan", Tony Li, Vince Fuller</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-grow-rfc1519bis-04.txt</link>
    <description>This memo discusses the strategy for address assignment of the existing 32-bit IPv4 address space with a view toward conserving the address space and limiting the growth rate of global routing state. This document obsoletes the original CIDR spec [RFC1519], with changes made both to clarify the concepts it introduced and, after more than twelve years, to update the Internet community on the results of deploying the technology described.</description>
