    <description>The Real-Time Communication Web (RTCWEB) approach uses browser-based scripts to minimize the number of network protocols between server and browser that need standardization.  With traditional interconnection concepts, the success of this effort is limited as different RTCWEB applications still need to interoperate.  This document proposes an alternative interconnection model where caller and callee always use the same RTCWEB client and server and avoid any interworking this way.</description>
