    <description>As the MPLS technologies develop, MPLS label is not only used with the local meaning which is always be understood by the upstream node and the downstream node, but also used with the global meaning which can be understood by all nodes or part of nodes in the network.  The document defines the latter as the global label and proposes the possible use cases of global label.  In these usecases MPLS global label can be used for location identification, VPN identification, segment routing, etc.</description>
