    <description>The CAA DNS record allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to CAs, but only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity.  However, the CAA specification also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular, CA-specific policy.  This specification defines two such parameters, one allowing specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URI and one allowing specific methods of domain control validation as defined by the ACME protocol to be required.</description>
