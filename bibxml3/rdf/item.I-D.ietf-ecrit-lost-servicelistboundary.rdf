    <title>"LoST Service List Boundary Extension", Karl Wolf</title>

    <description>LoST maps service identifiers and location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation> query to the LoST server.  However, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context information, that is, it does not provide any additional information about the geographical region for which the returned list of services is considered valid within.  Therefore, this document proposes a Service List Boundary that returns a local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the client to not miss a change in available services when moving.</description>
