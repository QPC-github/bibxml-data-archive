    <title>"IPv6 Prefix Length Recommendation for Forwarding", Mohamed Boucadair, Alex Petrescu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-boucadair-6man-prefix-routing-reco-03.txt</link>
    <description>The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding and routing processes is policy-based.  As such, no maximum length must be assumed by design.  Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing revealed a need for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding decision-making processes.  This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the prefix length.  The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</description>
