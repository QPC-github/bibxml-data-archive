    <description>Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using adjacency-sids, node-sids, and binding-sids.  It is important to provide fast reroute (FRR) mechanisms to respond to failures of links and nodes in the Segment-Routed Traffic-Engineered(SR-TE) path.  A point of local repair (PLR) can provide FRR protection against the failure of a link in an SR-TE path by examining only the first (top) label in the SR label stack.  In order to protect against the failure of a node, a PLR may need to examine the second label in the stack as well, in order to determine SR-TE path beyond the failed node.  This document specifies how a PLR can use the first and second label in the label stack describing an SR-TE path to provide protection against node failures.</description>
