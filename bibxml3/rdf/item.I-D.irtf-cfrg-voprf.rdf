        <description>An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between client and server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF).  The server provides the PRF secret key, and the client provides the PRF input.  At the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything about the PRF secret key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output. A Partially-Oblivious PRF (POPRF) is an OPRF that allows client and server to provide public input to the PRF.  OPRFs and POPRFs can also satisfy a notion of 'verifiability'.  In this setting, clients can verify that the server used a specific private key during the execution of the protocol.  This document specifies a POPRF protocol with optional verifiability instantiated within standard prime-order groups, including elliptic curves.</description>
