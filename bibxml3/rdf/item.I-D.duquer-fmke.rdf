    <title>"The Flat Multicast Key Exchange protocol", Laurence Duquerroy, Sebastien  Josset</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duquer-fmke-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a new group key management protocol called FMKE (Flat Multicast Key Exchange), derived from the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) [RFC3547]. Like the GDOI, its objective is to Manage securely group Security Associations (SA), i.e. establish and update SAs in Group members. These security associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group members. This protocol is based on a centralized management, achieved by the GCKS (Group Controller and Key Server). It is destined to be used by Data Security protocols such as the IPSEC ESP protocol. The FMKE protocol is destined to provide an optimized solution for very large groups with direct connections such as in satellite systems, or wireless systems such as WIFI. It can be considered as a GDOI use case adapted for satellite networks.</description>
