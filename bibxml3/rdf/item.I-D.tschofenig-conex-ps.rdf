    <description>The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together with flat-rate pricing, have made for increasing congestion problems on the network, which are often caused by a small number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.  In some cases, building out more capacity to handle this new congestion may be infeasible or unwarranted.  As a result, network operators have sought other ways to manage congestion both from their own users and from other networks.  These different types of solutions have different strengths and weaknesses, but all of them are limited in a number of key ways.  This document discusses the problems created for operators by high- consuming users and describes the strengths and weaknesses of a number of techniques operators are currently using to cope with high bandwidth usage.  The discussion of these solutions ultimately points to a need for a new kind of congestion accounting.</description>
