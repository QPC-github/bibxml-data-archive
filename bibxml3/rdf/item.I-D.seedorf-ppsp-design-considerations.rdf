    <description>Streaming video on P2P overlays puts extremely high demands and stress on the underlying network, especially in case of TV and live streaming.  The EU research project NAPA-WINE has devised an overall architecture for live video streaming that supports the needs of the users and content providers, while being respective of network-level needs, as reducing inter-AS traffic using ALTO-like services.  In this document, we describe generic elements of this software architecture for P2P live streaming and derive the corresponding implications for standardizing a Peer-to-Peer streaming protocol.</description>
