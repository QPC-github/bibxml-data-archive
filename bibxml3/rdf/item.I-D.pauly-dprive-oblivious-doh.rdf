        <description>This document describes an extension to DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) that allows hiding client IP addresses via proxying encrypted DNS transactions.  This improves privacy of DNS operations by not allowing any one server entity to be aware of both the client IP address and the content of DNS queries and answers.  This experimental extension is developed outside the IETF and is published here to guide implementation, ensure interoperability among implementations, and enable wide-scale experimentation.</description>
