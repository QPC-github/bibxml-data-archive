    <description>In any provider-based VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) devices attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a prerequisite to establish VPN-specific connectivity. The main purpose of an auto-discovery mechanism is to enable a PE to dynamically discover the set of remote PEs having VPN members in common. The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertises to other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the list of VPN members configured on that PE. Once that information is received the remote PEs will then identify the list of VPN sites members of the same VPN, and use the information carried within the discovery mechanism to establish VPN connectivity. This draft defines a BGP based auto-discovery mechanism for Virtual Router-based layer-3 VPNs. This mechanism is based on the approach used by BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN for distributing VPN routing information within the service provider(s).</description>
