    <description>There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and guaranteed communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a hub and spoke fashion.  To meet such application requirements in a Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network this draft defines a Hub and Spoke Multipoint Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (HSMP TE LSP) with resource reservations for guaranteed communication. This draft also defines a protocol to setup such LSPs by re-using and extending P2MP RSVP-TE.</description>
