    <description>This specification defines a profile for delegating client authentication and authorization in a constrained environment by establishing a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) channel between resource-constrained nodes.  The protocol relies on DTLS for communication security between entities in a constrained network.  A resource-constrained node can use this protocol to delegate management of authorization information to a trusted host with less severe limitations regarding processing power and memory.</description>
