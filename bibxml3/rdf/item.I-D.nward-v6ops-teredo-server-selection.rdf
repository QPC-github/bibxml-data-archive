    <description>This document describes performance, reliability and privacy problems inherent when using a remotely situated vendor-provided Teredo server, which is a common default in current implementations, and then discussed why configuring servers manually is bad and difficult. It recommends two partial solutions, and gives a final recommendation combining both solutions using anycast IPv4 and a well known DNS hostname.</description>
