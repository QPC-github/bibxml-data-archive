    <description>DOTS communications are machine-to-machine oriented communications. In addition DOTS agents are expected to end up in a large number of entities.  As a result, in addition to secure, the naming scheme to identify all DOTS agents must be scalable.  For these reasons this document recommends the use of cryptographic identifiers or strong Identities as opposed to human readable identifiers for example.  This document proposes two forms of strong Identities for the registration and operation of DOTS Agents.  One is 802.1AR LDevID [Std-802.1AR-2009] X.509 certificates.  The other is raw public keys as in HIP [RFC7401] or TLS/DTLS Raw Public Keys [RFC7250].</description>
