    <title>"Algorithm Agility Procedure for RPKI.", Roque Gagliano, Stephen Kent, Sean Turner</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rgaglian-sidr-algorithm-agility-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the process that Certificate Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RP) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set.  The process is expected to be completed in a time scale of months or years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.</description>
