    <title>"Specifying New Congestion Control Algorithms", Sally Floyd, Mark Allman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-cc-alt-04.txt</link>
    <description>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks). Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles. Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals. The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.</description>
