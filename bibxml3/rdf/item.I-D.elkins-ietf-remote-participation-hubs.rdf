    <description>For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased. As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide. Remote participation with more than one person is considered a hub.  Three types of remote hubs are defined.   Each has its own characteristics.  - Remote Participation Hubs - Remote Viewing Hubs - Enduring Local Meetups  This document defines a Remote Participation Hub (RPH).
