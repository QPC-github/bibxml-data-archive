        <description>With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber security and data protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the case regarding cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with the physical world.  Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to financial and physical damage and endanger human lives and well- being.  Thus, hard security and privacy requirements are necessary to be met.  Furthermore, a thorough investigation of incidents is essential for ultimate protection.  Computing in the Network (COIN) allows the processing of traffic and data directly in the network and at line-rate.  Thus, COIN presents a promising solution for efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as well as network monitoring.  This document discusses select mechanisms to demonstrate how COIN concepts can be applied to counter existing shortcomings of cyber security and data privacy.</description>
