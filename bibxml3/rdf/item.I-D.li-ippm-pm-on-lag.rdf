    <title>"Performance Measurement on LAG", Zhenqiang Li, Mach Chen, Greg Mirsky</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-li-ippm-pm-on-lag-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), and Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  With the measured metrics of each member links of a LAG, it enables operators to enforce performance metric based traffic steering policy among the member links.</description>
