    <description>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures.  This format intentionally only allows specifying coarse level location.  Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds.  This document describes a currently deployed format.  At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.</description>
