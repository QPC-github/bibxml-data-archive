    <description>In this draft, we made gap analysis with some exisitng IETF work that could be related to State Migration.  First of all, a short description of general state migration requirements is listed, and then we presents a brief survey of MIDCOM, PCP and Forces.  The goal of this draft is to figure out whether there are existing protocols we can reuse.</description>
