    <description>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information.  This document discusses how the neighbor discovery state machine on a first-hop router is causing user-visible connectivity issues when a new (not being seen on the network before) IPv6 address is being used.</description>
