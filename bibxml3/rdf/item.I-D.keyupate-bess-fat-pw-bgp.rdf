    <description>[RFC6391] describes a mechanism that uses an additional label (Flow Label) in the MPLS label stack that allows Label Switch Routers to balance flows within Pseudowires at a finer granularity than the individual Pseudowires across the Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMPs) that exists within the Packet Switched Network (PSN).  Furthermore,[RFC6391] defines the LDP protocol extensions required to synchronize the flow label states between the ingress and egress PEs when using the signaling procedures defined in the [RFC4447].  This draft defines protocol extensions required to synchronize flow label states among PEs when using the BGP-based signaling procedures defined in [RFC4761].  These protocol extensions are equally applicable to point-to-point L2VPNs defined in [RFC6624].</description>
