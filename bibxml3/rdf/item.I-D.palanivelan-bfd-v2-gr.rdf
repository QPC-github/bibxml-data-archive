        <title>"A Record of Discussions of Graceful Restart Extensions for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)", Palanivelan Appanasamy</title>
        <dc:date>2011-11-17T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document is a historical record of discussions about extending the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol to provide additional capabilities to handle Graceful Restart.  These discussions took place in the context of the IETF's BFD working group, and the consensus in that group was that these extensions should not be made.  This document presents a summary of the challenges to BFD in surviving a graceful restart, and outlines a potential protocol solution that was discussed and rejected within the BFD working group.  The purpose of this document is to provide a record of the work done so that future effort will not be wasted.  This document does not propose or document any extensions to BFD, and there is no intention that it should be implemented in its current form.</description>
