    <description>This document specifies the TCP Seamless Mobility Option (TCP-SMO) with variable length identifiers.  TCP-SMO allows mobility with session continuity, when either of the TCP endpoint change its IP address.  This is being done securely and without any additional round trips during mobility event.</description>
