    <title>"Nimble out-of-band authentication for EAP (EAP-NOOB)", Tuomas Aura, Mohit Sethi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-aura-eap-noob-08.txt</link>
    <description>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods.  This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation.  The EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that have no pre-configured authentication credentials.  The method makes use of a user-assisted one-directional OOB message between the peer device and authentication server to authenticate the in-band key exchange.  The device must have an input or output interface, such as a display, microphone, speakers or blinking light, which can send or receive dynamically generated messages of tens of bytes in length.</description>
