    <description>There are benchmarking methodologies addressing the performance of network interconnect devices that are IPv4- or IPv6-capable, but the IPv6 transition technologies are outside of their scope. This document provides complementary guidelines for evaluating the performance of IPv6 transition technologies.  More specifically, this document targets IPv6 transition technologies that employ encapsulation or translation mechanisms, as dual-stack nodes can be very well tested using the recommendations of RFC2544 and RFC5180. The methodology also includes a metric for benchmarking load scalability.</description>
