    <title>"OSPF Extensions in Support of Inter-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)  and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering", Mach Chen, Renhai Zhang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-ospf-interas-te-extension-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extensions to the OSPF version 2 and 3 protocols to support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes). OSPF-TE v2 and v3 extensions are defined for the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links which can be used to perform inter-AS TE path computation.  No support for flooding information from within one AS to another AS is proposed or defined in this document.</description>
