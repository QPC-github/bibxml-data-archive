    <title>"SAML in Authorization Policies", Christian Guenther</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-guenther-saml-policy-00.txt</link>
    <description>Rules of an authorization policy prescribe under which conditions an entity or subject has which permissions. Existing policies support identity-based authorization by matching the authenticated identity of the entity requesting access to a resource with the available policies. This document is about formulating policy rules that express conditions with respect to SAML assertions, thereby supporting non-identity-based authorization and anonymity.</description>
