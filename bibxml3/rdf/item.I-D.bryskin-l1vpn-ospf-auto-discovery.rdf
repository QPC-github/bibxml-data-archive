    <description>This document defines an OSPF based layer-1 VPN auto-discovery mechanism. This mechanism enables PEs using the OSPF IGP to dynamically learn about existence of each other, and attributes of currently configured CE-PE links and their associations with L1VPNs. This document builds on [L1VPN-FRMWK] and provides an auto-discovery mechanism as discussed in [L1VPN-BM].</description>
