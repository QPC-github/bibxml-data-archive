    <description>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows multihoming by using multiple addresses. When communication between the initially chosen addresses for a transport session is no longer possible, a "shim" layer makes it possible to switch to a different set of addresses without breaking current transport protocol assumptions. This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currently used address pair between two hosts and picking a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs. The input for these processes are ordered lists of local and remote addresses that are reasonably likely to work. (I.e., not include addresses that are known to be unreachable for local reasons.) These lists must be available at both ends of the communication, although the ordering may differ. Building these address lists from locally available information and synchronizing them with the remote end are outside the scope of this document. This text is for the most part based on discussions on the multi6 list, several multi6 design team lists and the shim6 list, with notable contributions from Erik Nordmark, Marcelo Bagnulo and Jari Arkko. Suggestions and additions are more than welcome.</description>
