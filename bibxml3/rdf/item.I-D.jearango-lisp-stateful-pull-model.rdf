    <title>"LISP Stateful Pull Model", Jesus Arango, Johnson Leong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jearango-lisp-stateful-pull-model-00.pdf</link>
    <description>This document specifies a stateful pull model for LISP where ITRs can subscribe with the mapping system to be notified whenever a particular EID mapping changes.  The model uses a publish/subscribe mechanism that supports overlapping EID registrations without having to notify the ITR about every single prefix covered by a particular subscription.  The pull model is stateful in the sense that it requires that the mapping system maintain subscription state.</description>
