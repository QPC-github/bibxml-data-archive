    <description>For the evaluation of network designs it is desirable to express their complexity in objective, measurable metrics.  Previous work has shown that a large number of distinct, partly dependent scales play a role in overall complexity.  This document proposes the use of multi- scale entropy metrics to describe the complexity of a network.  We observe that the complexity of a network which undergoes no changes over a longer time period is constant.  Conversely, when a network undergoes changes entropy is increasing; this is independent on whether the changes make the network more or less complex.  In other words, also a simplification effort increases complexity temporarily.</description>
