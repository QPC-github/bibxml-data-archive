    <title>"The AS_HOPCOUNT Path Attribute", Tony Li</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idr-as-hopcount-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the AS hopcount path attribute for BGP. This is an optional, transitive path attribute that is designed to help limit the distribution of routing information in the Internet. By default, prefixes advertised into the BGP mesh are distributed freely, and if not blocked by policy will propagate globally. This is harmful to the scalability of the routing subsystem since information that only has a local effect on routing will cause state creation throughout the default-free zone. This attribute can be attached to a particular path to limit its scope to a subset of the Internet.</description>
