    <description>There is a growing demand for routable IP addresses to support large wireless user base today. Wireless operators are looking for ways to leverage the IPv6 address space to meet the ever increasing number of wireless data users. The operators who have network-based IPv4 mobility solutions can leverage the same scheme to provide mobility access service with larger address pool using IPv6 addressing. The proposed approach solves both, by allowing provision of the network- based mobility service, and the IPv6 address acquisition for the MNs. The mobility contolling function may be located either at the dedicated Access Node (achieving a virtual link-layer to the HA) or at the first hop Access Router.</description>
