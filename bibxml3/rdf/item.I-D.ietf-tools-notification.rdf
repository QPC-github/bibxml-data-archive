    <description>The output of the IETF consists of documents. The IETF process is largely related to changing the status of documents. Active participation in the work of the IETF often consists of writing or editing documents or providing input to the process of changing the documents' status. Passive participation often consists of reading documents and observing the changes of their status. This document describes the requirements for an automated service that helps the IETF participants to learn about the existence and follow the changes of status of any particular document.</description>
