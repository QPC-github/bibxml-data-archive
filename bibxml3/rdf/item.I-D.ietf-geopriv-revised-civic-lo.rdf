    <title>"Revised Civic Location Format for PIDF-LO", Martin Thomson, James  Winterbottom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-geopriv-revised-civic-lo-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic location.  This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the civic location format in RFC 4119.  The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for DHCP, and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity schemes.  The format also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where appropriate.</description>
