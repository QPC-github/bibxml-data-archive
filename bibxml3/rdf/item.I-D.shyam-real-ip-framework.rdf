    <title>"An Architectural Framework of the Internet for the Real IP World", Shyam Bandyopadhyay</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shyam-real-ip-framework-61.txt</link>
    <description>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It shows how to make a transition from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with the existing network. With the useful works done through IPv6, it provides all necessary inputs based on which a specification of IP with 64 bit address space may be emerged.</description>
