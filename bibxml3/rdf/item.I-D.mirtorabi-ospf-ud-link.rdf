    <title>"Support of unidirectional links in OSPFv2", Sina Mirtorabi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mirtorabi-ospf-ud-link-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to support unidirectional links in OSPF and addresses its challenges. Unidirectional link routing (UDLR) describes a link-layer tunneling mechanism in order to abstract the network layer from unidirectional links and makes it transparent to routing protocols. Although this solution can be used, it can be cumbersome for user due to configured tunnels and generates extra overhead for control packets and encapsulation of tunnels. This document proposes the necessary extensions to OSPF in order to support unidirectional links.</description>
