        <description>This document proposes a new approach for deploying Ethernet LAN (ELAN) services with an objective of achieving high scalability, faster network convergence, and reduced operational complexity. Furthermore, it naturally brings the benefits of All-Active multihoming as well as MAC learning in data-plane.</description>
