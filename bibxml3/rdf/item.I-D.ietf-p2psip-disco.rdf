    <title>"A RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Control (DisCo)", Alexander Knauf, Thomas Schmidt, Gabriel Hege, Matthias Waehlisch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-p2psip-disco-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Control (DisCo) with SIP.  DisCo preserves conference addressing through a single SIP URI by splitting its semantic of identifier and locator using a new Kind data structure.  Conference members are enabled to select conference controllers based on proximity awareness and to recover from failures of individual resource instances.  DisCo proposes call delegation to balance the load at focus peers.</description>
