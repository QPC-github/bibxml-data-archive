    <description>This memo intended to describe the needs of Traffic Engineering (TE) in a Data Center Network (DCN) in which Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (Trill) has been adopted.  Several use cases have been proposed to demonstrate the usage while the feasibility of Trill extension has been evaluated.  It serves to motivate the normative work subsequently.</description>
