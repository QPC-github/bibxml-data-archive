    <title>"GSS-API Internationalization and Domain-Based Service Names and Name Type", Nicolas Williams, Alexey Melnikov</title>

    <description>This document describes domainname-based service principal names and the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API).  Internationalization of the GSS-API is also covered.  Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names, but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in addition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of domain-based names is to provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize insecure service discovery protocols.  This is achieved by providing a way to name clustered services after the "domain" which they service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of their service names.</description>
