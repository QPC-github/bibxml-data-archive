    <description>Thing to thing communication in Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) relies on URIs to link to servers.  Next to hierarchical configuration and short-lived IP addresses, this document introduces a naming scheme for devices based on cryptographic identifiers.  A special purpose domain is reserved for expressing those identifiers, and mechanisms for constrained devices to announce their names and to look them up are described.</description>
