        <description>In order to provision an optical connection through optical networks, a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and impairment constraints must be met to determine viable and optimal paths through the network.  The determination of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) for WSON, while it is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Spectrum Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON.  This document provides a YANG data model for the impairment-aware TE topology in optical networks.</description>
