        <description>The introduction of DNS over HTTPS (DoH), defined in RFC8484, presents a number of challenges to network operators.  These are described in this document.  The objective is to document the problem space and make suggestions that could help inform network operators on how to take account of DoH deployment.  This document also identifies topics that may require further analysis.</description>
