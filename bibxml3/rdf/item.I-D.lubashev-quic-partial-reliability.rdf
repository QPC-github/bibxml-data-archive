    <title>"Partially Reliable Message Streams for QUIC", Igor Lubashev</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lubashev-quic-partial-reliability-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo introduces a new EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame to enable partial reliability for QUIC streams.  The EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame allows a sender to give up on retransmitting older parts of a stream and to notify the receiver about this decision.  The content of this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery, and applicability drafts as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version 2 transport feature.</description>
