    <title>"Protocol Considerations for Enhanced VPN", Jie Dong, Stewart Bryant</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dong-rtgwg-enhanced-vpn-protocol-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the candidate protocol mechanisms which may be used to meet the requirements of enhanced virtual private networks (VPN+).  The gaps and limitations of existing mechanisms are analyzed, then a proposed mechanism is briefly described.  The proposed mechanism can be used to achieve network slicing to meet the stringent requirement of emerging 5G services, but it can also be useful in other general network scenarios.</description>
