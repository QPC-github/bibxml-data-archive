    <title>"The OSPF Opaque LSA Option", Lou Berger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-berger-ospf-rfc2370bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines enhancements to the OSPF protocol to support a new class of link-state advertisements (LSA) called Opaque LSAs. Opaque LSAs provide a generalized mechanism to allow for the future extensibility of OSPF. Opaque LSAs consist of a standard LSA header followed by application-specific information. The information field may be used directly by OSPF or by other applications. Standard OSPF link-state database flooding mechanisms are used to distribute Opaque LSAs to all or some limited portion of the OSPF topology. This document replaces [RFC2370], and adds to it a mechanism to enable an OSPF router to validate AS-scope opaque LSAs originated outside of the router's OSPF area.</description>
