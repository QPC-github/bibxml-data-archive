    <description>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".  Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane.  This draft describes the IS-IS extensions required to support Segment Routing over an IPv6 data plane.</description>
