    <description>Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few regions.  There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are organized.  Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India. The two regions are different in how they arose, where they meet, and what they do.  Thus, creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs may be very different across cultures and of very different sizes.  Lastly, this document discusses how IETF "central" can assist with remote hubs.</description>
