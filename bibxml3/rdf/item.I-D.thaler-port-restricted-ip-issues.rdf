    <description>This document discusses issues with assigning an IP address to a host interface such that the IP address may only be used with a restricted set of ports.  This concept is referred to herein as a port- restricted IP address.  A number of issues with this concept are documented, and the issues are contrasted with other approaches to dealing with IPv4 address exhaustion.</description>
