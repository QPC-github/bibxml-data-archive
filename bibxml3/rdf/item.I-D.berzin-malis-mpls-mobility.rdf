    <title>"Mobility Support Using MPLS and MP-BGP Signaling", Oleg Berzin, Andrew  Malis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-berzin-malis-mpls-mobility-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a new approach to handling user mobility at the network layer in the context of Multi-Protocol Label Switched Networks (MPLS).  This approach does not rely on the existing IP mobility management protocols such as Mobile IP, and is instead based on the combination of Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) and MPLS.  This document proposes to introduce new protocol elements to MP-BGP to achieve Mobility Label distribution at the network control plane and the optimal packet delivery to the mobile node by the network forwarding plane using MPLS.</description>
