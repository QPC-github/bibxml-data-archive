    <description>The use of GitHub in IETF working group processes is increasing. This document describes possible uses and conventions for working groups which are considering starting to use GitHub.  It does not mandate any processes, and does not intend to change the processes used by current working groups.  Discussion of this document takes place on the ietf-and-github mailing list (ietf-and-github@ietf.org), which is archived at &lt;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search?email_list=ietf-and- github>.</description>
