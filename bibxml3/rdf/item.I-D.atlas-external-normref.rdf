    <description>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to a non standards track specification except those from other standards bodies.  This document creates an External Specification registry, similar to the DownRef registry that has been created based on [RFC3967] and permits normative references to community accepted external specifications.</description>
