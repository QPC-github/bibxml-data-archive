    <title>"Strategies for Streaming Media Applications Using TCP-Friendly Rate  Control", Thomas Phelan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dccp-tfrc-media-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses strategies for using streaming media applications with unreliable congestion-controlled transport protocols such as the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) or the RTP Profile for TCP Friendly Rate Control. Of particular interest is how media streams, which have their own transmit rate requirements, can be adapted to the varying and sometimes conflicting transmit rate requirements of congestion control protocols such as TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).</description>
