    <title>"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Lightweight Directory Access  Protocol Schema for X.509 Certificates", Peter Gietz, Norbert Klasen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-ldap-pkc-schema-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol schema which can be used to implement a certificate store for X.509 certificates. Specifically, two structural object classes for X.509 user and CA certificates are defined. Key fields of a certificate are stored in LDAP attributes so that applications can easily retrieve the certificates needed by using basic LDAP search filters. Multiple certificates for a single entity can be stored and retrieved.</description>
