    <title>"Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)", Goeran Selander, John Mattsson, Francesca Palombini, Ludwig Seitz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-core-object-security-16.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), a method for application-layer protection of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).  OSCORE provides end-to-end protection between endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP. OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a range of proxy operations, including translation between different transport protocols.  Although being an optional functionality of CoAP, OSCORE alters CoAP options processing and IANA registration.  Therefore, this document updates [RFC7252].</description>
