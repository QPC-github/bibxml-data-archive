    <description>This document defines a YANG data model for the management of IP based tunnels.  The data model includes configuration data and state data.  In default format, it describes managed attributes used for managing tunnels of IPv4 or IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels.  And it can also serve as a base model which can be augmented with technology-specific details in other Ip based tunnel models.</description>
