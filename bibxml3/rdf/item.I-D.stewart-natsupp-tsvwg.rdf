    <description>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind a NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet been added to most NATs so that only pure NAT is available.  The end result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a NAT.  This document describes an SCTP specific chunks and procedures to help NAT's provide similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point traversal scenario.</description>
