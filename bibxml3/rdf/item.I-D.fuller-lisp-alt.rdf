    <title>"LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT)", Dino Farinacci, Vince Fuller, Dave  Meyer, Darrel Lewis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fuller-lisp-alt-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a method of building an alternative, logical topology for managing Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locator mappings using the Locator/ID Separation Protocol.  The logical network is built as an overlay on the public Internet using existing technologies and tools, specifically the Border Gateway Protocol and the Generic Routing Encapsulation.  An important design goal for LISP+ALT is to allow for the relatively easy deployment of an efficient mapping system while minimizing changes to existing hardware and software.</description>
