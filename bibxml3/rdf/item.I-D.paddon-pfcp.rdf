    <description>The Packet Filter Configuration Protocol (PFCP) is a client-server protocol which provides a mechanism for trusted clients to dynamically request updates to a packet filtering policy managed by a server. Typically, a server is either a packet filter or an entity which controls one or more packet filters. Since clients may specify permitted flows as and when they are required, packet filters configured via PFCP may operate an extremely restrictive default policy.</description>
