    <title>"Using IGMPv3 and MLDv2 For Source-Specific Multicast", Hugh Holbrook, Bradley Cain, Brian Haberman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-holbrook-idmr-igmpv3-ssm-08.txt</link>
    <description>The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols that allow a host to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to receive IPv4 and IPv6 multicast transmissions, respectively. Source- Specific Multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast transmission. This document defines the notion of an "SSM-aware" router and host, and clarifies and, in some cases, modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on SSM-aware routers and hosts to accomodate source- specific multicast. This document updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications.</description>
