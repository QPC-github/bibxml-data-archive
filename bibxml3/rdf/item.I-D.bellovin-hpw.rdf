    <description>Many systems (e.g., cryptographic protocols relying on symmetric cryptography) require that plaintext passwords be stored.  Given how often people reuse passwords on different systems, this poses a very serious risk if a single machine is compromised.  We propose a scheme to derive passwords limited to a single machine from a typed password, and explain how a protocol definition can specify this scheme.</description>
