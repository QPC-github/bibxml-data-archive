    <description>This draft enumerates several kinds of potential solutions that may resolve the problem described in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration. The goal is to, on one hand, make deeper analysis to this problem and, on the other hand, provide informaiton for gap analysis, and authors of gap analysis can make research on the potential solutions to find out whether there are existing protocols or mechanisms can be reused to compose a specific potential solution.  The solutions introduced here are just high level thought and, if one solution is regarded as a preferred way, we need to analyze and define, if needed, detail mechanism and protocols in future.</description>
