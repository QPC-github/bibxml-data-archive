        <title>"Terms of Appointments for Nomcom-selected IETF Leadership Positions", John Klensin</title>

        <description>A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure in leadership roles is not in the best interests of the community. While, in theory, that advice could simply be given to the Nomcom, there is reason to believe that a different model for consideration of renewal or replacement for members of the leadership would be more efficient for the Nomcom and would impose less hardship on incumbents and the community.  This document outlines that alternate method.</description>
