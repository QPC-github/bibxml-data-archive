    <title>"A Mechanism to Secure SIP Identity headers inserted by Intermediaries", Mary  Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-sipping-sec-inserted-info-02.txt</link>
    <description>This draft discusses a standard mechanism for securing information in SIP requests and responses, inserted by intermediaries, which may be used by other intermediaries or the endpoints as the basis for services. The requirements are based on the need for a general middle-to-middle and middle-to-end security mechanism applicable to both headers and message bodies. This mechanism is optional, however, the use of it enhances the overall security of SIP by ensuring the integrity of the information inserted by an intermediary.</description>
