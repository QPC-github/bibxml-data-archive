    <title>"In Case of DNSSEC Validation Failures, Do Not Change Resolvers", Jason Livingood</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-livingood-dont-switch-resolvers-02.txt</link>
    <description>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is beginning widespread deployment. However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.  As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur.  When these failures do occur, end users SHOULD NOT change to a non-validating DNS resolver.</description>
