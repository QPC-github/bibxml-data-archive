    <title>"Priority Placeholders in HTTP/2", Mike Bishop</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bishop-httpbis-priority-placeholder-01.txt</link>
    <description>RFC7540 defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating priorities.  Some implementations have begun using closed streams as placeholders when constructing their priority tree, but this has unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC. This document proposes an extension to the HTTP/2 priority scheme for both protocols.</description>
