        <description>Computing in the network may require the embedded computing capability in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and there might be so much distributed computing task in the network. Some new applications like AR/VR, motion control put forward higher demand of network than before, and AI is also considered to be used in the app and network.  In order to satisfy the demands, it needs to guarantee both the bandwidth resource and the computing resource which is linked by the network.</description>
