    <title>"Quantum-Resistant GSS-API Key Exchange for SSH", Hubert Kario</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kario-gss-qr-kex-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC4462.  It defines a new key exchange method that uses GSS-API in a way to provide key exchange method that is resistant to attacks by quantum computers.  The purpose of this specification is to provide an easy- to-implement upgrade to environments that require resistance against quantum computers before widely accepted post-quantum cryptography algorithms are established.</description>
