    <description>This document presents a  POF-ICN based multihoming transmission framework.POF is an SDN forwarding plane technology proposed by Huawei,we use it to enable information-centric networking (ICN). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the multihoming transmission system.we first describe the relationships among the various components of mobile networks and the newly added entities, such as Mobility management and Session management.Then we describe the Multihoming transmission  operation flow to  to outline what each components needs to accomplish and to how these components and mechanisms fit together.</description>
