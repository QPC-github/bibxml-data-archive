    <title>"A probabilistic scheme for fast Router Advertisement responses in IPv6", Greg Daley</title>

    <description>The IPv6 Neighbour Discovery RFC provides for random delays of between 0 to 500 milliseconds, in order to spread responses to solicitations when multiple routers exist on a link. This document describes an alternative scheme for responding to Router Solicitations which estimates the number of routers on the link, and aims to reduce the delay spread for responding Router Advertisements.</description>
