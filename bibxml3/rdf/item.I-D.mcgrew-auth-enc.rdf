    <title>"An Interface and Algorithms for Authenticated Encryption", David McGrew</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mcgrew-auth-enc-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines algorithms for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), and defines a uniform interface and a registry for such algorithms. The interface and registry can be used as an application independent set of cryptoalgorithm suites. This approach provides advantages in efficiency and security, and promotes the reuse of crypto implementations.</description>
