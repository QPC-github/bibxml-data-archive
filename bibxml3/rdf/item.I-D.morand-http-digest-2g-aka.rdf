        <title>"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using GSM 2G Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA)", Lionel Morand</title>
        <dc:date>2014-04-14T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and key generation functions A3 and A8, also known as GSM AKA or 2G AKA. The HTTP Authentication Framework includes two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest.  Both schemes employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.  The GSM AKA mechanism performs user authentication and session key distribution in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks.  GSM AKA is a challenge-response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.</description>
