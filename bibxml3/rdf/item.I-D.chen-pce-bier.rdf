        <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279].  BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets based on a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE).  This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to compute and initiate the path for the BIER-TE.</description>
