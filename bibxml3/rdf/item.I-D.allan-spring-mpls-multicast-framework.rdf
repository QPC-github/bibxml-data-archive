    <title>"A Framework for Computed Multicast applied to MPLS based Segment Routing", Dave Allan, Jeff Tantsura</title>

    <description>This document describes a multicast solution for Segment Routing with MPLS data plane. It is consistent with the Segment Routing architecture in that an IGP is augmented to distribute information in addition to the link state. In this solution it is multicast group membership information sufficient to synchronize state in a given network domain. Computation is employed to determine the topology of any loosely specified multicast distribution tree.</description>
