    <description>Traditional mail system handles only US-ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. The Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) is implemented by allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. To deliver IMA through IMA incompliant environment, some sort of converting mechanism (i.e. downgrading) is required. This document describes requirements for downgrading, SMTP session downgrade, header downgrade and implementation consideration.</description>
