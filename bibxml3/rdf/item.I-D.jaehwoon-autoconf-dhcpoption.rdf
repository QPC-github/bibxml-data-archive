    <description>The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network composed of mobile nodes which can communicate with each other via multiple wireless links. The modified MANET architecture is now standardizing that can resolve the multi-link subnet issue. In this draft, we define two DHCP options in order that a MANET Router (MR) gets the network prefix assigned to the connected MANET. The one is the MANET prefix request option used by a MR when it wants to know the network presix allocated to the MANET. The other is the MANET prefix option that DHCP server provides the MANET prefix to the requesting MR.</description>
