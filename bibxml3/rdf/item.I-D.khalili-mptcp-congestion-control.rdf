    <description>This document describes the mechanism of OLIA, the "Opportunistic Linked Increases Algorithm". OLIA is a congestion control algorithm for MPTCP. The current congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA [4], forces a tradeoff between optimal congestion balancing and responsiveness. OLIA's design departs from this tradeoff and provide these properties simultaneously. Hence, it solves the identified performance problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and responsiveness behavior of LIA, as shown by different studies [5, 6, 7, 8]. OLIA is now part of the UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation [9, 11].</description>
