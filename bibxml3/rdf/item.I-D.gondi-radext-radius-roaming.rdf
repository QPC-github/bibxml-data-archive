    <description>The functionalities of radius server can be extended to provide new types of services for the users in Wireless and cellular network. Traditionally Radius servers are limited to authentication, access and accounting, there are few researchers proposing new extensions  to provide new functionalities for radius server in wireless and cellular networks. In this draft we are proposing to extend the functionalities of Radius to extend it to roaming and handover support for the mobile terminals. Using this mechanism the mobile terminal initially gets access to the network and then when there is a possibility of handover and roaming with the other access networks, mobile terminal communicates with the home radius server and creates the pre authentication information. In this process different mechanisms essential for roaming and handover are addressed such as Network Selection, Handover Initiation, Security Context Management, and Mobility Management. Using this mechanism the latency for handover and roaming can be reduced with higher level control mobility of the terminal during handover and roaming.</description>
