    <title>"TLV Naming in the MANET Generalized Packet/Message Format", Christopher Dearlove, Thomas Clausen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-manet-tlv-naming-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document reorganizes the naming of already allocated TLV (type- length-value) types and type extensions in the Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) registries defined by RFC 5444 to use names appropriately. It has no consequences in terms of any protocol implementation.  This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from RFC 5444, so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type and type extension allocations.  It makes no other changes to RFC 5444.</description>
