        <description>As described in [I-D.xiong-rtgwg-precise-tn-requirements], the deterministic networks not only need to offer the Service Level Agreements (SLA) guarantees such as low latency and jitter, low packet loss and high reliability, but also need to support the precise services such as flexible resource allocation and service isolation so as to the Precise Transport Networking.  However, under the existing IP network architecture with statistical multiplexing characteristics, the existing deterministic technologies are facing long-distance transmission, queue scheduling, dynamic flows and per- flow state maintenance and other controversial issues especially in Wide Area Network (WAN) applications.  This document analyses the problems in existing deterministic technologies to provide precise services in various industries such as 5G networks.</description>
