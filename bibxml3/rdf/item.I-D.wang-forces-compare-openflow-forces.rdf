    <description>While both ForCES and OpenFlow follow the basic idea of separations of forwarding plane and control plane in network elements, they have some technical differences. This document analyzes the differences between OpenFlow and ForCES technically from the aspects of goals, architecture, forwarding model and protocol interface. The two techniques can learn much from each other in their standardization process.</description>
