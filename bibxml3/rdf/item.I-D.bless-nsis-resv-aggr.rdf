    <title>"Inter-Domain Reservation Aggregation for QoS NSLP", Mark Doll, Roland Bless</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bless-nsis-resv-aggr-01.txt</link>
    <description>QoS NSLP is a recently proposed signaling protocol that allows to establish QoS reservations in the Internet. In order to enable large scale deployment, inter-domain aggregation should be considered as mechanism to allow for the necessary scalability in the control plane. This draft describes the major problems that must be solved and proposes also solutions to these problems, requiring only modest modifications and extensions to the currently defined GIST and QoS NSLP specifications.</description>
