    <description>This document specifies the "icon" URI scheme.  Icons have a fundamental role in user interaction with computer operating systems. In a graphical user interface, they may represent a file, folder, application, or device.  They live on the desktop, in toolbars, and in menus.  Most operating systems provide a standard set of icons that match the look and feel of the system.  The "icon" URI scheme lets web page designers leverage these existing platform icons.</description>
