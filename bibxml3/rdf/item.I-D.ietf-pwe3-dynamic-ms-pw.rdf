    <title>"Dynamic Placement of Multi-Segment Pseudowires", Luca Martini, Matthew Bocci, Florin Balus</title>

    <description>RFC5254 describes the service provider requirements for extending the reach of pseudowires (PW) across multiple Packet Switched Network domains. A Multi-Segment PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function as a single point- to-point PW. This document describes extensions to the PW control protocol to dynamically place the segments of the multi-segment pseudowire among a set of Provider Edge (PE) routers. This document also updates RFC6073 as follows: it updates the value of the length field of the PW Switching Point PE Sub-TLV Type 0x06 to 14.</description>
