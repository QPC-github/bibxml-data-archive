    <description>In the long history of the development of the DNS security [1] extensions, a number of alternate methodologies and modifications have been proposed and rejected for practical, rather than strictly technical, reasons. There is a desire to be able to experiment with these alternate methods in the public DNS. This document describes a methodology for deploying alternate, non-backwards-compatible, DNSSEC methodologies in an experimental fashion without disrupting the deployment of standard DNSSEC.</description>
