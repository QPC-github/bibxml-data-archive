    <title>"Intent Distribution for Autonomic Networking", Bing Liu, Sheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-anima-intent-distribution-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the requirements of distributing intent information in an autonomic network.  Ideally, the intent may be generated/injected at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed among the whole autonomic domain.  Then this document resolves the distribution requirements into protocol design requirements. Specifically, this document introduces a solution which is some extension based on the Anima signalling protocol (GDNP, Generic Discovery and Negotiation Protocol).</description>
