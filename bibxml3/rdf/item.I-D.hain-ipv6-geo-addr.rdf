    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hain-ipv6-geo-addr-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an IPv6 Geographic global unicast address format for use in the Internet.  The address format defined in this document is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [2].  It is designed to facilitate scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple service providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the site. A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers at will without requiring their network to renumber.</description>
