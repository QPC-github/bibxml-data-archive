    <title>"Use Cases for High Bandwidth Query and Control of Core Networks", Greg Bernstein, Young Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bernstein-alto-large-bandwidth-cases-02.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate application layer traffic optimization applied to high bandwidth core networks.  The type of information and interactions needed to perform various optimizations is described. In addition extensions to the existing ALTO protocol widely applicable to any high bandwidth applications are suggested.  These include bandwidth constraint representations for a diverse range of control and data plane technologies as well as advanced filtering based on constraints.</description>
