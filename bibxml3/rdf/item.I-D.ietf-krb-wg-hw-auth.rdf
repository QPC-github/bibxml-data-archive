    <title>"Passwordless Initial Authentication to Kerberos by Hardware  Preauthentication", Matt Crawford</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-hw-auth-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to the Kerberos protocol for performing initial authentication of a user without using that user's long-lived password. Any "hardware preauthentication" method may be employed instead of the password, and the key of another principal must be nominated to encrypt the returned credential.</description>
