    <description>This document describes procedures to damp multicast VPN routing state changes and control the effect of the churn due to the multicast dynamicity in customer sites.  The procedures described in this document are applicable to BGP-based multicast VPN and help avoid uncontrolled control plane load increase in the core routing infrastructure.  New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP unicast route damping principles, but adapted to multicast.</description>
