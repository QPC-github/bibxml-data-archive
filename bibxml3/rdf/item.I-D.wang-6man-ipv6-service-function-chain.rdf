    <description>Service function chain is the definition of an ordered set of service functions.  After instantiated, the service function path is created and the classified traffic is steered through the corresponding service function path and then forwarded to the final destination. This document tries to describe how to use IPv6 data plane and IPv6 extension headers to realize service function chain in IPv6 network.</description>
