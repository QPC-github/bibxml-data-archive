    <description>In some application of the associated channel header (ACH), it is necessary to have the ability to include a set of TLVs to provide additional context information for the ACH payload.  This document defines a number of TLV types.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
