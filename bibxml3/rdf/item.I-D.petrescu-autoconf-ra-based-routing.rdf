    <description>This draft specifies extensions to the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement messages and processing.  Traditionally, prefixes contained in RAs are used for on-link determination, on-link address auto- configuration, but not for path setup towards multi-hop destinations. The extensions proposed here still rely on RAs being communicated on a single link (not across several IP hops), but upon RA reception the prefixes are installed in the routing table; they are thus used for forwarding packets further than a single link (multi IP hop).</description>
