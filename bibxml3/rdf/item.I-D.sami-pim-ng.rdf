    <description>This document specifies a new generation of PIM family of multicast routing protocols called Protocol Independent Multicast-Next Generation (PIM-NG) which is faster in source discover and provides many features suitable for Different type of networks. PIM-NG uses the underlying unicast routing information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group. It achieves this due to the fact that the processes through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point and a host finds the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done in a whole new way and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is discovered faster at the cost of additional memory. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than its predecessor. Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides many features along a robust and flexible control and administration over multicast networks.</description>
