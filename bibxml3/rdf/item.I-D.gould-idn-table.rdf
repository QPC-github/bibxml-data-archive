    <title>"Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Table Mapping", James Gould, Francisco Obispo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gould-idn-table-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) mapping for getting Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Table information for the registration of IDNs, using the EPP domain name mapping, and optionally with the IDN mapping extension.  An IDN Table defines the valid set of characters (code points) that can be used in a domain name.  Code points may overlap across IDN Tables and the IDN Tables supported by the servers are up to server policy.  The IDN Table information can be used to validate an IDN prior to registration, can be cached by the client for pre-validation, can be used to select the best IDN Table for the IDN, and can be used to know if and what IDN Table Identifier to pass in a domain create.</description>
