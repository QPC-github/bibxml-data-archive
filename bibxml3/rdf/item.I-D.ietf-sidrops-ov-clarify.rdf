    <title>"BGP RPKI-Based Origin Validation Clarifications", Randy Bush</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sidrops-ov-clarify-05.txt</link>
    <description>Deployment of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based BGP origin validation is hampered by, among other things, vendor mis- implementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those mis-implementations; and thus updates RFC 6811 by clarifying that all prefixes should have their validation state set, and that policy must not be applied without operator configuration.</description>
