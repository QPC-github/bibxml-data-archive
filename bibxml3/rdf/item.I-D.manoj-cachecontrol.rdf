    <title>"An Extension to Cache-Control, HTTP/1.1 for group caching", G Manoj</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-manoj-cachecontrol-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Cache-Control general-header field of HTTP/1.1 [1] is used to specify directives that must be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. This document details an extension to the cache-control header to enable caching of resources for dynamic sets of users who are grouped under certain attributes. Also this document specifies user-defined header extensions of HTTP/1.1 [1], which allow these clients to be served from the group caches.</description>
