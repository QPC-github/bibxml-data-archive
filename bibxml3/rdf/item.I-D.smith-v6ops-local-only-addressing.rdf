    <title>"Default IPv6 Local Only Addressing for Non-Internet Devices", Mark Smith</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-smith-v6ops-local-only-addressing-00.txt</link>
    <description>For certain types or models of devices it should be clear and obvious that, by default, they should not be reachable from the global IPv6 Internet, or able to reach the global IPv6 Internet, even though the network they are attached to provides global IPv6 Internet connectivity.  This memo proposes that these types of devices refuse to configure and use global IPv6 Internet addresses by default.</description>
