    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-manycouches-completely-virtual-meetings-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document captures initial thoughts about having IETF meetings that are completely virtual.  It explores the issues involved with both a "planned" virtual meeting and an "emergency" virtual meeting. The intent is to evolve this document to provide answers to the questions posed throughout the text.  This is currently a thought experiment.  There are no current plans to hold a completely virtual IETF meeting.</description>
