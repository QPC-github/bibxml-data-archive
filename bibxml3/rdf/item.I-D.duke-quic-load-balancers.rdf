    <title>"QUIC-LB: Generating Routable QUIC Connection IDs", Martin Duke, Nick Banks</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duke-quic-load-balancers-06.txt</link>
    <description>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/ port 4-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state load balancers.  They also can prevent linkability of connections across deliberate address migration through the use of protected communications between client and server.  This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries.  This specification standardizes methods for encoding routing information and proposes an optional protocol called QUIC-LB to exchange the parameters of that encoding.  This framework also enables offload of other QUIC functions to trusted intermediaries, given the explicit cooperation of the QUIC server.</description>
