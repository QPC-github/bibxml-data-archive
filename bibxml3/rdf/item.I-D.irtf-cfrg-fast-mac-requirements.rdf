    <title>"Requirements on Fast Message Authentication Codes", David McGrew, Brian  Weis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-cfrg-fast-mac-requirements-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo outlines requirements guiding the development of a fast Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm suitable for use with many IETF protocols, but in particular routing protocols that use a MAC for packet authentication.  It is widely conjectured that secure MACs that are fast in software are possible, and many interesting MACs have appeared in the literature.  Nevertheless, none of these MACs have seen broad adoption, and none are a good match for the routing protocol case. We hope that this memo brings together MAC designers and MAC users for a fruitful discussion.</description>
