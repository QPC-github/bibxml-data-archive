    <description>The BULK DNS resource record type defines a method of pattern-based creation of DNS resource records based on numeric substrings of query names.  The intent of BULK is to simplify generic assignments in a memory-efficient way that can be easily shared between the primary and secondary nameservers for a zone.</description>
