    <description>RFC 8372 (MPLS Flow Identification Considerations) describes the requirement for introducing flow identities within the MPLS architecture.  This document describes a method of accomplishing this by using a technique called Synonymous Flow Labels in which labels which mimic the behaviour of other labels provide the identification service.  These identifiers can be used to trigger per-flow operations on the packet at the receiving label switching router.</description>
