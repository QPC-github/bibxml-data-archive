    <description>This document describes network coding as a network function.  It also describes how a network coding function can be virtualized and integrated with virtual network functions architectures.  The network coding function is not a traditionally implemented network function in dedicated hardware as those that have triggered network function virtualization.  It refers to a novel network functionality that generalizes classic packet-level end-to-end coding.  Classic packet- level end-to-end coding helps in the provision of quality of service by trading off delay and reliability.  Network coding goes beyond that by enabling in-network optimized re-encoding, which can provide both throughput gains and diverse network-controlled degrees of reliability.  Consequently, a virtualized network coding function can serve as a flow engineering tool over virtualized networks (e.g. over network slices).</description>
