    <description>This document provides a security overview and analysis for the Peer- to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network.  It discusses security threats for the P2PSIP architecture and its components.  It compares security difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP, and then partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer and the security relationship among the layers.</description>
