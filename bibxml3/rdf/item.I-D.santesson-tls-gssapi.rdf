    <title>"Flexible Key Agreement for Transport Layer Security (FKA-TLS)", Larry Zhu, Girish Chander, Jeffrey Altman, Stefan Solomon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-santesson-tls-gssapi-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines extensions to RFC 4279, "Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", to enable dynamic key sharing in distributed environments using a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism, and then import that shared key as the "Pre-Shared Key" to complete the TLS handshake. This is a modular approach to perform authentication and key exchange based on off-shelf libraries. And it obviates the need of pair-wise key sharing by enabling the use of the widely-deployed Kerberos alike trust infrastructures that are highly scalable and robust. Furthermore, conforming implementations can provide server authentication without the use of certificates.</description>
