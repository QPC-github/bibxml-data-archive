    <title>"CA Key Rollover in the RPKI", Geoff Huston, George Michaelson, Stephen Kent</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sidr-keyroll-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how a Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) performs a planned rollover of its key pair.  This document also notes the implications of this key rollover procedure for Relying Parties (RPs).  In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache of the objects that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way in which a CA performs key rollover impacts RPs.</description>
