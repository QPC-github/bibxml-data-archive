    <title>"Use of the IPv6 Flow Label within an LLN", Pascal Thubert</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thubert-roll-flow-label-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document present how the Flow Label can be used inside a LLN as a replacement to the RPL option and provides rules for the root to set and reset the Flow Label when forwarding between the inside of RPL domain and the larger Internet, in both direction.  This new operation aims at saving an IPv6 in IPv6 encapsulation within the RPL domain that is required with the RPL option for all packets that reach outside of the RPL domain.</description>
