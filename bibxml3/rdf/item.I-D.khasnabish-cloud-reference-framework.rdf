    <description>This document presents a cloud reference framework that intends to provide a basis for designing interoperable cloud services and their integration into existing open Internet and enterprise IT infrastructures.  In general, a cloud-based system utilizes virtualized computing / communications / storage resources and applications, and allows their combined provisioning as complex infrastructure services.  In the emerging cloud-based virtualized infrastructures and services are provisioned on on-demand basis, and configured for specific customer needs or tasks.  The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs that are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (Cloud SDO, I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey), on-going standardisation activities and other research and developments in the cloud computing technology area.  Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud reference frameworks are presented and the requirements to the general functional layers and components are discussed.</description>
