    <description>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990.  This document is Part 5 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, updates RFC 2616 and RFC 2617.  Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests.</description>
