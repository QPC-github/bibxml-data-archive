    <description>This document proposes a conceptual database, the Routing Authentication Policy Database (RAPD), which cooperates with the key table to provide the configuration information for the automated key management protocols in generating key materials for routing protocols.  Additionally, the RAPD also provides authorization policies so as to guarantee that the keying material for securing routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate peers.</description>
