    <description>A Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7 LCP) is described that is used for retrieving location information from a server within an access network.  The protocol includes options for retrieving location information in two forms: by value and by reference.  The protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol that is independent of session-layer.  This document describes the use of HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTP over Transport Layer Security (HTTP/TLS) as transports for the protocol.</description>
