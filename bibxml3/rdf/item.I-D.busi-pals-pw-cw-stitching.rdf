    <description>This document defines the behavior of a new type of Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) Switching PE (S-PE) which enhances the S-PE functions defined in [RFC 6073], with the capability to switch an Ethernet pseudowire (PW) segment that uses the PW Control Word (CW) [RFC 4385] with an Ethernet PW segment that does not use the CW.  This new type of S-PE can be deployed in the network one hop away, at the MPLS layer, from a Terminating PE (T-PE) which does not support CW for Ethernet PW encapsulation [RFC 4448]. In this way, all the Ethernet PW packets sent though the MPLS network will have the CW and be protected against incorrect equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) behavior as described in [I-D ETH-CW].</description>
