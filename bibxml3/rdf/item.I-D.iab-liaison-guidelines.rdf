    <title>"Guidelines for Acting as an IETF Liaison to Another Organization", Loa  Andersson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-liaison-guidelines-04.txt</link>
    <description>Whenever the IETF decides to enter into a liaison relationship with another organization, such as a Standards Development Organization (SDO), a consortium, or an industrial forum, a liaison manager is appointed. The procedures used by the IAB to establish and maintain liaison relationships between the IETF and other organizations are described in RFC 4052 [RFC4052]. This document expands on the role of liaison managers and liaison representatives giving guidelines on their mandate and the expectations, tasks and responsibilities placed on them.</description>
