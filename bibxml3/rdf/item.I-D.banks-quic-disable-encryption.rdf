    <description>The disable_1rtt_encryption transport parameter can be used to negotiate the disablement of encryption on 1-RTT packets, allowing for reduced CPU load and improved performance.  This extension is only meant to be used in environments where both endpoints completely trust the path between themselves; not, for instance, on the open internet.</description>
