    <description>Autonomic systems were first described in 2001.  The fundamental goal is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and self-protection.  This is achieved by an autonomic function having minimal dependencies on human administrators or centralized management systems.  It usually implies distribution across network elements.  This document defines common language, and outlines design goals and non-design goals for autonomic functions.  A high level reference model illustrates how functional elements in an autonomic network interact.</description>
