        <description>This is a light weight routing protocol applicable inside a network that appears in the form of a tree and distribution of address space takes place with the approach of VLSM. It is based on setting default route inside VLSM tree.  With this approach, routing information of the external world need not be passed down to the VLSM tree. Thus, load inside a router gets reduced substantially.  This document includes IP-VPN with MPLS inside VLSM tree by extending RSVP-TE.</description>
