    <title>"Transporting User to User Call Control Information in SIP for ISDN Interworking", Alan Johnston, Joanne McMillen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-johnston-sipping-cc-uui-09.txt</link>
    <description>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed.  As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency. This document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document.  A new SIP header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</description>
