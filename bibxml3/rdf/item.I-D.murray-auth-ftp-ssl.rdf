    <title>"Securing FTP with TLS", Paul Ford-Hutchinson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-murray-auth-ftp-ssl-16.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS protocol defined by [RFC-2246] and the extensions to the FTP protocol defined by [RFC-2228]. It describes the subset of the extensions which are required and the parameters to be used; discusses some of the policy issues that clients and servers will need to take; considers some of the implications of those policies and discusses some expected behaviours of implementations to allow interoperation. This document is intended to provide TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that provided for SMTP in [RFC-2487] and HTTP in [RFC-2817]. That this specification is in accordance with the FTP RFC [RFC-959] and relies on the TLS protocol [RFC-2246] and the FTP security extensions [RFC-2228].</description>
