    <title>"The Problem Statement for the Standard Configuration of DiffServ Service Classes", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-diffserv-stds-problem-statement-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the problem statement on two recently proposed expansions to DiffServ. The first of these expansions proposes updating the informational RFC 4594 document to standards track status, while making the necessary changes to make it current; for example, creating more granular traffic treatments, some with new Per Hop Behaviors (PHB). The second proposal defines 6 new DiffServ Codepoints necessary from these new PHBs in the proposal within the first draft.</description>
