    <description>The fs_locations attribute in NFSv4 provides support for fs migration, replication and referral. Given the current work on supporting these features, and the new needs such as support for global namespace, it is time to look at this area and see what further development of this protocol area may be required. This document makes suggestions for the further development of these features in NFSv4.1 and also presents ideas for work that might be done as part of future minor versions.</description>
