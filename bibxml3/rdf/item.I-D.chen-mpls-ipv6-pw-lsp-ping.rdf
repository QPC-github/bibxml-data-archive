    <description>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and Traceroute mechanisms are commonly used to detect and isolate data plane failures in all MPLS LSPs including Pseudowire (PW) LSPs. The PW LSP Ping and Traceroute elements, however, are not specified for IPv6 address usage.  This document extends the PW LSP Ping and Traceroute mechanisms so they can be used with IPv6 PWs, and updates RFC 4379.</description>
