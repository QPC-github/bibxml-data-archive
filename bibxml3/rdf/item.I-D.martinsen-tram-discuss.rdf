    <description>This draft describes a mechanism for information exchange between an application and the network.  The information provided from the application to the network MAY be used by a network element in the path to modify its behavior to improve application quality of experience (QoE).  Likewise, the information provided by the network to the application MAY be used by the application to modify its behavior to optimize for QoE.  The information provided from the application to the network can also be useful for middleboxes that are responsible for security at edges of network (e.g. firewalls) or other middleboxes in determining how to treat the packets delivered from this application.</description>
