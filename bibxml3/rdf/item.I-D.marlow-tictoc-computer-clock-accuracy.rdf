    <title>"Network Time Mechanisms for Improving Computer Clock Accuracy", Sterling Knickerbocker, Timothy Plunkett</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-marlow-tictoc-computer-clock-accuracy-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes network time synchronization mechanisms that may enable increased accuracy, beyond that possible with the current Network Time Protocol version 4 standard, to the time of computer clocks. The mechanisms considered are those that will provide improved estimates as to when a packet is put on the network, transferred across a network, or taken from the network. Potential standardization actions will be considered for the mechanisms considered, though no such actions are recommended at this time.</description>
