    <title>"Unique Per-Node Origin ASNs for Globally Anycasted Services", Danny McPherson, Ryan Donnelly, Frank Scalzo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-grow-unique-origin-as-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document makes recommendations regarding the use of unique origin autonomous system numbers per node for globally anycasted critical infrastructure services in order to provide routing system discriminators for a given anycasted prefix.  Network management and monitoring techniques, or other operational mechanisms may employ this new discriminator in whatever manner best accommodates their operating environment.</description>
