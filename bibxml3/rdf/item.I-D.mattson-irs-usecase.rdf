    <title>"IRS Use Case for IP and Transport Workflows", Geoffrey Mattson, Thomas Nadeau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mattson-irs-usecase-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes use-cases for IRS to provide a lightweight method for common management and control state for typical operations and workflows of multilayer networks involving both IP and sub-IP transport. IRS provides a lightweight, streaming interface between routing systems and external applications. By extending the IRS model to transport systems, multi-layer networks can be managed and used more efficiently. IRS may enable the integration of IP and transport maintenance workflows leading to a reduction in operational costs. IRS server having visibility into both Optical Transport and IP domains will also be able to make optimal use of transport infrastructure.</description>
