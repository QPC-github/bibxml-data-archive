    <description>Lightweight 4over6 [RFC7596] is an IPv4 over IPv6 hub-and-spoke mechanism that provides overlay IPv4 services in an IPv6-only access network.  It uses a deterministic, DHCPv6 based method for the provisioning of IPv4 addresses and port sets to customer CE devices. This document describes how existing specifications can be used for the dynamic IPv4 provisioning of Lightweight 4over6, based on DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341].</description>
