    <title>"A Uniform Resource Name Namespace for the Global System for Mobile communications Association (GSMA) and the International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI)", Michael Montemurro, Andrew Allen, David McDonald, Paul Gosden</title>

    <description>This specification specifies a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the GSMA (Global System for Mobile communications Association) and a Namespace Specific String (NSS) for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identity), and an associated parameter for the IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software Version number).  The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the specification for Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution).  The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.  URNs from this namespace almost always contain Personally Identifying Information and need to be treated accordingly.</description>
