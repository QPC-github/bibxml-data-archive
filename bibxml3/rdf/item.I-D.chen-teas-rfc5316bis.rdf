    <title>"ISIS Extensions in Support of Inter-Autonomous System (AS) MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering", Mach Chen, Les Ginsberg, Stefano Previdi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-teas-rfc5316bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extensions to the ISIS (ISIS) protocol to support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes).  It defines ISIS-TE extensions for the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links, which can be used to perform inter- AS TE path computation.  No support for flooding information from within one AS to another AS is proposed or defined in this document.</description>
