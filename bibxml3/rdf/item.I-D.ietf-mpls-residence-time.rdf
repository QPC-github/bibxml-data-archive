    <description>This document specifies a new Generic Associated Channel for Residence Time Measurement and describes how it can be used by time synchronization protocols within a MPLS domain.  Residence time is the variable part of the propagation delay of timing and synchronization messages; knowing what this delay is for each message allows for a more accurate determination of the delay to be taken into account in applying the value included in a Precision Time Protocol event message.</description>
