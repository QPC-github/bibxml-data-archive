    <title>"Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO)", David McGrew, John Foley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mcgrew-aero-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO), a cryptographic technique that provides all of the essential security services needed for communication security.  AERO offers several advantages over other methods: it has more compact messages, provides stronger misuse resistance, avoids the need to manage implicit state, and is simpler to use.  This document defines a particular AERO algorithm as well as a registry for such algorithms.</description>
