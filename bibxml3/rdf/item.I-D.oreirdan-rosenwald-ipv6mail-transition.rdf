    <title>"Recommendations for the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6 for Internet Service Providers", Heather Lord, Jordan Rosenwald</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-oreirdan-rosenwald-ipv6mail-transition-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document contains a phased plan for how providers of email services can effect and manage the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6.  It is expected that this will be effected over a period of years and it is unlikely that any transition will completely exclude the ongoing possibility of using IPv4 as a transport mechanism for email.  This provides one possible implementation plan for transitioning email services on the Internet from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model that suports IPv6.</description>
