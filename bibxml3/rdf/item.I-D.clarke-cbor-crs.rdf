    <title>"Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tag for Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Specification", Trevor Clarke</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-clarke-cbor-crs-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.  In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. An existing CBOR tag, 103, allows for the representation of geographic coordinates.  Proper exploitation of geographic coordinates requires an associated reference frame.  The present document defines a CBOR tag for referencing the coordinate reference system (CRS) for a geographic coordinate.  It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tag defined.</description>
