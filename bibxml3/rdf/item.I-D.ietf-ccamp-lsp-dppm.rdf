    <description>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most promising candidate technologies for future data transmission network.  GMPLS has been developed to control and operate different kinds of network elements, such as conventional routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop Multiplexers (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross- connects (OXCs), etc.  The dynamic provisioning ability of these physically diverse devices differs from each other drastically.  At the same time, the need for dynamically provisioned connections is increasing because optical networks are being deployed in metro areas.  As different applications have varied requirements in the provisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to define standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance of networks and application needs can be mapped to each other.  This document provides a series of performance metrics to evaluate the dynamic Label Switched Path (LSP) provisioning performance in GMPLS networks, specifically the dynamic LSP setup/release performance.  These metrics can be used to characterize the features of GMPLS networks in LSP dynamic provisioning.</description>
