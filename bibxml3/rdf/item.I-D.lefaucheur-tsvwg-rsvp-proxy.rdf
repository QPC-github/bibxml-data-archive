    <description>RSVP signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the QoS required by certain flows. With RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling. Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable. This document defines RSVP Proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to perform RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable. This allows resource reservations to be established on parts of the end-to-end path.</description>
