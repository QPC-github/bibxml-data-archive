    <title>"LISP Map Server Interface", Vince Fuller, Dino Farinacci</title>

    <description>This draft describes the Maping Service for the Locator Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types of LISP- speaking devices, the LISP Map Resolver and LISP Map Server, that provides a simplified "front end" to for one or more Endpoint ID to Routing Locator mapping databases.  By using this service interface and communicating with Map Resolvers and Map Servers, LISP Ingress Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers, are not dependent on the details of mapping database systems, which facilitates experimentation with different database designs.  Since these devices implement the "edge" of the LISP infrastructure, connect directly to LISP-capable Internet end sites, and comprise the bulk of LISP-speaking devices, reducing their implementation and operational complexity should also reduce the overall cost and effort of deploying LISP.</description>
