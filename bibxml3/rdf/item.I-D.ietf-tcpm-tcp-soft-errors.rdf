    <title>"TCP's Reaction to Soft Errors", Fernando Gont</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcp-soft-errors-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a non-standard, but widely implemented, modification to TCP's handling of ICMP soft error messages, that rejects pending connection-requests when those error messages are received.  This behavior reduces the likelihood of long delays between connection establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including one in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments.</description>
