    <title>"Authorizing Use of Domains in MAIL FROM", Mark Lentczner, Meng Weng Wong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-marid-mailfrom-00.txt</link>
    <description>Mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular, existing protocols place no restriction in what a sending host can use as the reverse-path of a message. This document describes a protocol whereby a domain can explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name in a reverse-path, and a way for receiving hosts to check such authorization.</description>
