    <title>"Protocol for Stage Illumination", Marcus Ertl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mertl-psi-04.pdf</link>
    <description>This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other illumination requirements.  It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional DMX (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations and adding flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery and metadata, among other useful features.  Due to the complexity and length, versions 4 and above only describe a subset of the full PSI.</description>
