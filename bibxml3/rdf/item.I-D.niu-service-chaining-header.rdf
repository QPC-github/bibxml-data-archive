    <description>This document describes a service chaining mechanism, which is used to indicate the data packets going through multiple Service Processing Entities and processed by those Service Processing Entities with preset order. This document also provides a new service chaining header encapsulation for packets in a service chain. The system can get the information of the next Service Processing Entity where the data packet should go by checking the service chaining header.</description>
