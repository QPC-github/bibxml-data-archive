    <title>"A Location Dereference Event Package using the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Rohan Mahy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mahy-geopriv-sip-loc-pkg-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package to dereference raw location data about named SIP resources (as opposed to presence data with embedded filtered location) as a GEOPRIV Using Protocol. The resulting location information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped in GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information Document Format (PIDF-LO). In the envisioned usage, location disclosure is limited to voluntary disclosure to the target of its own location or to a trusted service (such as a presence server) which enforces the target's privacy rules on the target's behalf.</description>
