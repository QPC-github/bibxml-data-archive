    <description>This document defines a new Relay Agent Link Selection(RALS) option for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).The new option is inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent when forwarding client- originated DHCPv6 packets to a DHCPv6 server. Servers recognizing this new option can include link-selection information as part of policies about address assignment, prefix delegation, or other DHCP parameters.</description>
