    <description>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection of nodes.  Each site is named by an exterior address whereas each node by an interior local address.  Exterior routing depends solely on site addresses while interior routing on node addresses.  Mobility is inherent in Interior routing while migration and multihoming are in exterior routing.  The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well as Internet of Things.</description>
