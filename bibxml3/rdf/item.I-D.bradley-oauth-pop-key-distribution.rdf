    <title>"OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession: Authorization Server to Client Key Distribution", John Bradley, Phil Hunt, Michael Jones, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bradley-oauth-pop-key-distribution-01.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 6750 specified the bearer token concept for securing access to protected resources.  Bearer tokens need to be protected in transit as well as at rest.  When a client requests access to a protected resource it hands-over the bearer token to the resource server.  The OAuth 2.0 Proof-of-Possession security concept extends bearer token security and requires the client to demonstrate possession of a key when accessing a protected resource.  This document describes how the client obtains this keying material from the authorization server.</description>
