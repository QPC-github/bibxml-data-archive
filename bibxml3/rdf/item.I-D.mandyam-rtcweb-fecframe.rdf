    <description>WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between web applications by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between two clients.  This RTP stream is expected to be sent over an UDP (Universal Datagram Protocol) connection, which by definition has no built-in reliability.  Recently the FEC FRAME Working Group of the IETF has come up with a framework and technical recommendations for applying forward error correction (FEC) to unreliable streams.  This framework can be applied to WebRTC with minimal changes to the specification.</description>
