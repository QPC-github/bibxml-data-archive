    <title>"BGP OPERATIONAL Message", David Freedman, Robert Raszuk, Rob Shakir</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idr-operational-message-00.txt</link>
    <description>The BGP Version 4 routing protocol (RFC4271) is now used in many ways, crossing boundaries of administrative and technical responsibility.  The protocol lacks an operational messaging plane which could be utilised to diagnose, troubleshoot and inform upon various conditions across these boundaries, securely, during protocol operation, without disruption.  This document proposes a new BGP message type, the OPERATIONAL message, which can be used to effect such a messaging plane for use both between and within Autonomous Systems.</description>
