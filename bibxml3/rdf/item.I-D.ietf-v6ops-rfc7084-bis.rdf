    <title>"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers", Jordi Palet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-v6ops-rfc7084-bis-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router.  Specifically, the current version of this document focuses on the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning of IPv6 hosts attached to it and the support of HNCP ([RFC7788]) for automated provisioning of downstream routers.  The document also covers several transition technologies, as required in a world where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts in the customer LANs with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring to communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet, are able to do so.  The document obsoletes RFC 7084.</description>
