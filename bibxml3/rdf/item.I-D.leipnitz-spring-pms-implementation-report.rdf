    <description>This document reports round-trip delay measurements captured by a single MPLS Path Monitoring System (PMS) compared with results of an IPPM conformant measurement system, consisting of three different Measurement Agents.  The measurements were made in a research backbone with an LDP control plane.  The packets of the MPLS PMS use label stacks similar to those to be used by a segment routing MPLS PMS.  The measurement packets of the MPLS PMS remained in the network data plane.</description>
