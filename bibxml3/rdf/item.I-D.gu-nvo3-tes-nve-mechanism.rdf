    <title>"The mechanism and signalling between TES and NVE", Gu Yingjie, Li Yizhou</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gu-nvo3-tes-nve-mechanism-01.txt</link>
    <description>his draft introduces the interaction required between TES to NVE when NVE is located in an external box to TES .  The signaling between TES and NVE has to be designed carefully to reflect all the interaction requirements.  This document describes the relevant considerations for such design and also provides a basic analysis of the potential reusable protocols.  Currently this draft focuses on the general interaction procedures with relevant parameters and the signaling design consideration.  It may be extended to show more detailed signalling design recommendation and/or solution recommendation in the future with the progress of NVO3's work.</description>
