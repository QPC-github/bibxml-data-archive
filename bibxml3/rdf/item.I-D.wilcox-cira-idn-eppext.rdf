    <description>The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), administering the .CA country-code top-level domain, offers internationalized domain names (IDN) in French, one of Canada's official languages. CIRA's Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) services have been augmented with an IDN EPP extension in order to support registrars desiring to register internationalized domains using French characters as bundled domains.  This document defines the extension to the Extensible Provisioning Protocol used at CIRA to support IDN operations.</description>
