        <description>The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different types of cost metrics.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic "routingcost" metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers a better delay performance, the base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.  This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network delay, delay variation (a.k.a, jitter), packet loss rate, hop count, and bandwidth.  There are multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements or service-level agreement) to derive a performance metric.  This document introduces an additional "cost-context" field to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey the source of a performance metric.</description>
