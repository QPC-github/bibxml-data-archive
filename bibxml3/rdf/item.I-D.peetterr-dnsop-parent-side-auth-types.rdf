    <title>"Parent-side authoritative DNS records for enhanced delegation", Peter van Dijk, Petr Spacek</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peetterr-dnsop-parent-side-auth-types-00.txt</link>
    <description>A DNS RRtype numeric range that behaves like DS is reserved.  This means: being authoritative on the parent side of a delegation; being signed by the parent; being provided along with delegations by the parent.  If this document had become an RFC five years ago, deploying new types (along the lines of NS2/NS2T, DSPKI or various other imagined things like DNS ('signed delegation NS')) would be easier to deploy and experiment with today.</description>
