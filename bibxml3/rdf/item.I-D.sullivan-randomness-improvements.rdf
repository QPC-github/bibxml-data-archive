    <description>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related transport security protocols.  Weak or predictable cryptographically-strong pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes.  See the Dual EC random number backdoor for a relevant example of this problem.  This document describes a way for security protocol participants to mix their long-term private key into the entropy pool from which random values are derived.  This may help mitigate problems that stem from broken CSPRNGs.</description>
