    <description>This document describes an architecture aimed for reducing the latency of network access authentication based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).  The architecture is based on the design of a new EAP method for which a standalone authenticator is used, and does not require any change to the EAP specification or the specifications of existing EAP lower-layers.</description>
