    <description>The Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) specification and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly included in a path setup.  Further Exclude Routes extensions to RSVP-TE allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly excluded in a path setup.  This document specifies new subobjects to include or exclude domains during path setup where domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility (such as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous System (AS)).  Note that the use of AS as an abstract node representing domain is already defined in existing RSVP-TE specefications, albeit with a 2-Byte AS number.</description>
