    <title>"An IRIS schema for Emergency Service contact URIs", Ted Hardie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardie-ecrit-iris-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an XML-based protocol for passing location information to a server that returns emergency service contact URIs. It is intended to fit within a larger framework of standards. Specifically, it presumes the existence of a URI scheme appropriate for signalling that emergency service is required and distinguishing among emergency services if appropriate. It also presumes that an entity requesting this response will be able to handle the URIs returned as input to appropriate handlers.</description>
