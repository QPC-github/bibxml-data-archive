    <title>"Depth-First Forwarding in Unreliable Networks (DFF)", Ulrich Herberg, Alvaro Cardenas, Tadashige Iwao, Michael Dow, Sandra Cespedes</title>

    <description>This document specifies the "Depth-First Forwarding" (DFF) protocol for IPv6 networks, a data forwarding mechanism that can increase reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane, but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets using a mechanism similar to a "depth-first search" for the destination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC2460) and in addition also for LoWPAN "mesh-under" networks (as specified in RFC4944).  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the next hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little traffic, and is used for unicast transmissions only.</description>
