    <title>"TCP Alternatives with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE", Jonathan  Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-mmusic-ice-tcp-00.txt</link>
    <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model of session negotiation. ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Simple Traversal of UDP over NAT (STUN). ICE provides a general framework for describing alternates, but only defines UDP-based transport protocols. This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream.</description>
