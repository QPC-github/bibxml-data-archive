    <description>In support of Segment Routing(SR), routing protocols advertise a variety of identifiers used to define the segments that direct packet forwarding.  In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol instance is either internally inconsistent or conflicts with advertisements from another protocol instance a means of notifying the originator about the inconsistency is required.  This document defines a generic mechanism to notify the BGP originator about the inconsistency in the network.</description>
