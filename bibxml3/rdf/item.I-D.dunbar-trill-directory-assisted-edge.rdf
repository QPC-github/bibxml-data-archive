    <description>RBridge edge nodes currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their corresponding RBridge edge nodes by observing the data packets traversed through. When ingress RBridge receives a data packet with its destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) unknown, the data packet is flooded across RBridge domain. When there are more than one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can be designated as AF port for forwarding/receiving traffic for each LAN, the rest have to be blocked for that LAN.  This draft describes the framework of using directory assisted RBridge edge to improve TRILL network scalability in data center environment.</description>
