    <description>This memo defines metrics plus a methodology for post-measurement processing of sample metrics to evaluate network path performance relative to streaming video traffic. The metrics are based on established methodologies for TCP throughput testing. The post- processing methodology is based on a model of streaming traffic that allows a given sample metric to be evaluated against multiple sets of parameters representing different streaming rates, delays and buffering values. The results of the post-processing methodology are derived metrics that are suitable for statistical analysis.</description>
