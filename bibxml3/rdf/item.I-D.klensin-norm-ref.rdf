    <title>"Handling Normative References to Standards Track Documents", Sam Hartman, John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klensin-norm-ref-04.txt</link>
    <description>The IETF and RFC Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given maturity level cannot be published until all documents it references as normative are at that maturity level or higher. This rule has sometimes resulted in very long publication delays for documents and some claims that it was a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level. The IETF agreed to a way to bypass this rule with RFC 3967. This document describes a simpler procedure for downward references to Standards track and BCP documents, namely "note and move on". The procedure in RFC 3967 still applies for downward references to other classes of document. In both cases, annotations should be added to such References.</description>
