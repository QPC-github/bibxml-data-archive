    <description>The Domain Name System (DNS) naming syntax provides no meta-data for indicating administrative transitions through the hierarchy.  For example, it does not distinguish the higher-level portions that operate as public registries, versus those that operate as private organizations.  This specification creates a basic overlay mechanism for defining a logical Perimeter between administrative entities through the naming hierarchy.  The mechanism can then be applied for a variety of independent administrative indications.</description>
