    <title>"A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Option for Requesting and Receiving a  Uniform Resource Identifier of a Public Safety Answering Point or Emergency services Routing Proxy", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-dhc-ecrit-uri-psap-esrp-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHC) Option for client requesting and/or receiving a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) URI to be used by higher layer protocols during emergency calling. In some network models, an ESRP URI and a PSAP URI will be equivalent from the client's point of view, therefore this document purposely vague differentiating between the two, as the difference does not matter to DHCP.</description>
