    <description>In certain scenarios, for example when bootstrapping a network, it is desirable to automatically bring up a secure, routed control plane, which is independent of device configurations and global routing table.  This document describes an approach for an "Autonomic Control Plane", which can be used as a "virtual out of band channel" - a self-managing overlay network, which is independent of configuration, addressing and routing on the data plane.</description>
