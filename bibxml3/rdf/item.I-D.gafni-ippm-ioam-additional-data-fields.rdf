        <description>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  This document discusses additional data fields and associated data types to be added to the IOAM data fileds described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]. In-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated into a variety of protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, IPv6 (via extension header), or IPv4.</description>
