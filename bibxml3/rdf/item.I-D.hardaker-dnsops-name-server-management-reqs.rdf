    <title>"Requirements for Management of Name Servers for the DNS", Wesley Hardaker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardaker-dnsops-name-server-management-reqs-03.txt</link>
    <description>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) has traditionally been done using vendor-specific monitoring, configuration and control methods.  Although some service monitoring platforms can test the functionality of the DNS itself there is not a interoperable way to manage (monitor, control and configure) the internal aspects of a name server itself.  This document discusses the requirements of a management system for DNS name servers.  A management solution that is designed to manage the DNS can use this document as a shopping list of needed features.</description>
