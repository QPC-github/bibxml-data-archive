    <description>The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and procedures for advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicast streams of a given MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel.  This document defines such encoding and procedures. These procedures allow in certain situations to reduce MVPN control plane load (note though that these procedures have no impact on the data plane load).  The procedures specified in this document assume that BGP is used for transmission of MVPN customers' routing information within the service provider(s) infrastructure.
