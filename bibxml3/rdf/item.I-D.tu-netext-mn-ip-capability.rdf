    <description>WiFi is beginning to be considered as a trusted non-3GPP access network which can provide the service of accessing to the EPC core network to the user.  And EAP/AKA(and EAP/AKA') is specified as the access authentication protocol in this case.  This document defines a new EAP attribute to provide the mobile node IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6 capability to the network so that mobile node IP address/prefix assignment and PMIP session establishment can be processed accordingly.</description>
