        <description>This document defines a new Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) Data Item that is used to support traffic classification.  Traffic classification information is used to identify traffic flows based on frame/packet content such as destination address.  The Data Item is defined in an extensible and reusable fashion.  Its use will be mandated in other documents defining specific DLEP extensions.  This document also introduces DLEP Sub-Data Items, and Sub-Data Items are defined to support DiffServ and Ethernet traffic classification.</description>
