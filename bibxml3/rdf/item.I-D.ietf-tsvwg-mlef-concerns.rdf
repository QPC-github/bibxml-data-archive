    <description>The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States Department of Defense, with its contractors, has proposed a service architecture for military (NATO and related agencies) telephone systems. This is called the Assured Service, and is defined in two documents: "Architecture for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice over IP" and "Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice over IP". Responding to these are three documents: "Extending the Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header to account for Preemption Events", "Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol", and the "Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior" (MLEF PHB). MLEF, as currently defined, has serious problems, which this draft seeks to discuss.</description>
