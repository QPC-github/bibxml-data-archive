    <title>"Allocating and Retiring Special Purpose MPLS Labels", Kireeti Kompella, Loa Andersson, Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mpls-special-purpose-labels-06.txt</link>
    <description>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly called "reserved labels".  They will be called "special purpose labels" in this document.  As there are only 16 of these special purpose labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special purpose labels, yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called for.  This memo defines new procedures to follow in the allocation and retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for these labels to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and creates a new one called the "Extended Special Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry.  This document updates a number of previous RFCs that used the term "reserved label".  Specifically, this document updates RFC 3032, RFC 3038, RFC 3209, RFC 3811, RFC 4182, RFC 4928, RFC 5331, RFC 5586, RFC 5921, RFC 5960, RFC 6391, RFC 6478, and RFC 6790.</description>
