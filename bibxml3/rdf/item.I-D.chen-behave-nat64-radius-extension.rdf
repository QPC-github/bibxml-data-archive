    <title>"Radius Attributes for Stateful NAT64", Gang Chen, David Binet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-behave-nat64-radius-extension-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes new radius attributes for stateful NAT64.  The extensions are used to provide geo-location services with an exact IPv6 soruce address.  The message flow to deliver the NAT64 binding information between radius clients and servers is also described. Therefore, accurate location could be traced out depending on the radius method.</description>
