    <description>The MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of Music Electronics industry (AMEI) have produced the Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) standard [n1]. SP-MIDI has been approved for 3GPP standardization and a dedicated SP-MIDI profile has been defined for 3GPP SP-MIDI devices [n2]. Since MIDI information is a very compact media type, 3GPP is initially focusing on the application of SP-MIDI for music downloading and messaging applications that require MIME registration.</description>
