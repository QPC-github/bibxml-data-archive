    <title>"Proof of Possession to Devices for Onboarding", Eliot Lear, Owen Friel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lear-brski-pop-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo specifies a RESTful interface for local deployments to demonstrate proof of possession to a device or to a manufacturer authorized signing authority (MASA).  This covers the case where a MASA would not otherwise have knowledge of where a device is deployed, or when a MASA may not be required.  Such knowledge is important to onboard certain classes of devices, such as those on IEEE 802.11 networks.</description>
