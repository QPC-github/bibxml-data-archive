    <description>EVPN provides a flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet connectivity in an IP/MPLS and/or an NVO-based network. In NVO networks, there is also a need for a dynamic and efficient inter- subnet connectivity across Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual and may not support their own routing protocols. This document defines a new EVPN route type for the advertisement of IP Prefixes and explains some use-case examples where this new route- type is used.</description>
