    <description>QTP is a simple protocol for multiplexing short-duration connections over an arbitrary transport service such as UDP. QTP is an open standard to allow dial-up Credit Authorization Terminals (CAT) or Point-Of-Sale (POS) terminals to connect into IP hosts. These transactions require fast connection times, efficient concentration of many sessions, fault tolerant operation, and the ability to transfer access network addressing (called and calling numbers) along with transaction data.</description>
