    <description>New research in the design of peer-to-peer overlay networks offers the possibility of addressing limitations of existing service, resource and content discovery methods. We identify the research goals to be pursued in investigating new designs for global scale service discovery. The purpose of this document is to attract participation from other researchers interested in these problems and to lead to a coordinated research approach within the P2PRG CORE subgroup.</description>
