    <description>This document creates a registry for describing the types of services available at a specific location.  The registry is expected to be referenced by other protocols that need a common set of service terms as protocol constants.  In particular, we define location-based service as either a point at a specific geographic location (e.g., bus stop) or a service covering a specific region (e.g., pizza delivery).</description>
