    <description>[I-D.kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp-01] discusses requirements for Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane Protocol Functionality.  The IEEE has developed a protocol called VSI Discovery Protocol (VDP) specified in [IEEE8021Qbg]. This protocol is intended to address the same basic problems at layer two as the Hypervisor-to-NVE protocol needs to address at layer three.  Simply by adding the ability to carry layer three addresses to VDP using the extensibility features built into the protocol, VDP may be used as the Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane protocol.</description>
