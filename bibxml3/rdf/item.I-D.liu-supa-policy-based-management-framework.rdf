    <description>Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG data models to encode policy, which will point to device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG models developed in other working groups. Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level, possibly network-wide policies to a network management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element). The network management function can then control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services. This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements and interfaces.</description>
