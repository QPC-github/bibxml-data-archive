    <title>"Multihop Federations for Application Bridging for Federation Beyond the Web (ABFAB)", Margaret Wasserman, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mrw-abfab-multihop-fed-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust across a multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation Beyond the Web (ABFAB) framework.  This document introduces a new entity, the Trust Router.  Trust Routers exchange information about the availability of Trust Paths across a multihop federation.  They can be queried by a Relying Party to obtain the best Trust Path to reach an Identity Provider.  They also provide temporary identities that can be used by a Relying Party to traverse a Trust Path.</description>
