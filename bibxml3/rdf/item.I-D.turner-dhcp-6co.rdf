    <title>"DHCPv6 Option for Configuration of 6LoWPAN Compression Contexts", Randy Turner</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-turner-dhcp-6co-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a DHCPv6 option to configure hosts on a 6LoWPAN with IPv6 address compression information as required by stateful compression methods specified in RFC 6282.  The option provides up to 16 prefixes that can be associated with specific instances of IPv6 address compression used in 6LoWPANs.  Each prefix can be a variable length of bits, and includes a validity lifetime as well.</description>
