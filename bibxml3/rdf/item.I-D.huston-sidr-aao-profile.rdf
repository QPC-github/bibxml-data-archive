    <title>"A Profile for AS Adjacency Attestation Objects", Geoff Huston, George Michaelson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huston-sidr-aao-profile-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a profile for AS Adjacency Attestation Objects (AAOs).  An AAO is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an AS holder has made an attestation that it has a inter-domain routing adjacency with one or more other AS's, with the associated inference that this AS is prepared to announce or receive routes with these adjacent AS's in the inter-domain domain environment.</description>
