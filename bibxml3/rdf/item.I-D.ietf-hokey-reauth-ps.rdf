    <description>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication problem statement.  The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing an EAP method.  This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless environments.  This document details the problem and defines design goals for a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.</description>
