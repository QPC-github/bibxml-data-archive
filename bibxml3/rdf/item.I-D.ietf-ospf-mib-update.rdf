    <title>"OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base", Spencer Giacalone</title>

    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing version 2 of the Open Shortest Path First Routing Protocol. Version 2 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv4 address family. Version 3 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family. This memo obsoletes RFC 1850, however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The functional differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in section 12.</description>
