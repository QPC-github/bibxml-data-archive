    <description>In some inter autonomous system (AS) and inter-area deployment scenarios for RFC 4379 "Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping and Traceroute", a replying Label Switching Router (LSR) may not have the available route to an initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure of operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This document describes extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have the capability to relay the Echo Response by a set of routable intermediate nodes to the initiator.  This document updates RFC 4379.</description>
