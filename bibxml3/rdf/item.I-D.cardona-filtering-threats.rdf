    <title>"Making BGP filtering a habit: Impact on policies", Camilo Cardona, Pierre Francois</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cardona-filtering-threats-02.txt</link>
    <description>Network operators define their BGP policies based on the business relationships that they maintain with their peers.  By limiting the propagation of BGP prefixes, an autonomous system avoids the existence of flows between BGP peers that do not provide any economical gain.  This draft describes how undesired flows can emerge in autonomous systems due to the filtering of overlapping BGP prefixes by neighboring domains.</description>
