    <title>"Multiple Packetization Times in the Session Description Protocol (SDP):  Problem Statement, Requirements &amp; Solution", Marc Willekens, Miguel Garcia, Peili Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-garcia-mmusic-multiple-ptimes-problem-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a problem statement and requirements with respect to the presence of a single packetization time (ptime/ maxptime) attribute in SDP media descriptions that contain several media formats (audio codecs).  Furthermore, a best common practice solution for the use of 'ptime/maxptime' is proposed based on 'static', 'dynamic' and 'indicated' values.  Some methods already proposed as ad-hoc solutions and background information is included in an appendix.</description>
