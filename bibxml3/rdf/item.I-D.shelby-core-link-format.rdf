    <description>This document defines a link format for use by constrained CoAP web servers to describe URIs of resources offered along with other attributes.  Based on the HTTP Link Header format, the CoRE link format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type.  A well-known URI is defined as a default entry-point for requesting the list of links to resources hosted by a server.</description>
