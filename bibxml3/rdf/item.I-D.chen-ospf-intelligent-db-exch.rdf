    <title>"Intelligent OSPF Link State Database Exchange", Huaimo Chen</title>

    <description>This document presents an intelligent database exchange mechanism for the database exchange procedure in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  This mechanism is backward compatible.  It eliminates the unnecessary database exchanges through using the existing reachability information calculated from the link state database and the un-reachability information about routers recorded.  It significantly speeds up the establishment of the full adjacency between two routers in some situations.</description>
