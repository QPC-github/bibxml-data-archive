    <title>"Configuring Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) using DHCPv6", Sheng Jiang, Zhongqi Xia</title>

    <description>A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses binding with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA specifications are lack of procedures to enable proper management of the usage of CGAs. This document defines the process using DHCPv6 to manage CGAs in detail. A new DHCPv6 option is defined accordingly. This document also analyses the configuration of the parameters, which are used to generate CGAs, using DHCPv6. Although the document does not define new DHCPv6 option to carry these parameters for various reasons, the configuration procedure is described.</description>
