    <title>"The DCCP Service Code", Gorry Fairhurst</title>

    <description>This document describes the usage of Service Codes by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol, RFC 4340. Service Codes provide a method to identify the intended service/application to process a DCCP Connection Request. This provides improved flexibility in the use and assignment of port numbers for connection multiplexing. The DCCP Service Code can also enable more explicit coordination of services behind NATs and firewalls. This document motivates the setting of Service Codes by applications, rather than assigning a default Service Code value of zero.</description>
