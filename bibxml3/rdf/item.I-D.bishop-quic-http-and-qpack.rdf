    <title>"Header Compression for HTTP/QUIC", Mike Bishop</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bishop-quic-http-and-qpack-07.txt</link>
    <description>HTTP/2 [RFC7540] uses HPACK [RFC7541] for header compression. However, HPACK relies on the in-order message-based semantics of the HTTP/2 framing layer in order to function.  Messages can only be successfully decoded if processed by the decoder in the same order as generated by the encoder.  This draft refines HPACK to loosen the ordering requirements for use over QUIC [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].</description>
