    <description>This document summarises a problem statement for an IP-based autonomic network that is mainly based on distributed network devices.  The document reviews the history and current status of autonomic aspects of IP networks.  It then reviews the current network management style, which is still heavily depending on human administrators.  Finally the document describes the general gaps between the ideal autonomic network concept and the current network abilities.</description>
