    <title>"Challenges in Smart Object Security: too many layers, not enough ram", Michael Richardson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-richardson-smartobject-security-00.txt</link>
    <description>This is a position paper for the pre-IETF83 Workshop on Smart Object Security.  The author contends that layer-2 security solutions are not only in-adequate, but may in fact be harmful when deployed into smart object systems.  While layer-2 security services may be valuable, they must be channel bound up to the layer-7 application layer.</description>
