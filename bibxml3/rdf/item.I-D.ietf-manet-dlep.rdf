    <description>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link (speed, state, etc.) in order to make routing decisions.  In mobile or other environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow the router to make the best decisions.  DLEP describes a new protocol for a bidirectional, event-driven communication channel between the router and the modem to facilitate communication of changing link characteristics.</description>
