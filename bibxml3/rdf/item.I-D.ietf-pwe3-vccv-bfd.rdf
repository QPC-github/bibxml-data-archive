    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-bfd-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes Connectivity Verification (CV) types using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV).  VCCV provides a control channel that is associated with a Pseudowire (PW), as well as the corresponding operations and management functions such as connectivity verification to be used over that control channel.</description>
