    <description>Widely deployed mobility management systems for wireless communications have isolated the path for forwarding data from the control plane signaling for mobility management.  To realize this requirement with Mobile IP requires that the control functions of the home agent be addressable at a different IP address than the source IP address of the tunnel between the home agent and mobile node. Similar considerations hold for mobility anchors implementing Hierarchical Mobile IP or PMIP.</description>
