    <title>"Registration Coupled Subscriptions in the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Jonathan Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sipping-reg-sub-00.txt</link>
    <description>When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent starts up, it registers to the network and initiates numerous subscriptions in order to learn about various network events. This results in a chatty startup procedure which substantially impacts recovery times under avalanche restart. This specification proposes a mechanism whereby the subscriptions can be established as a side effect of the registration, alleviating this problem.</description>
