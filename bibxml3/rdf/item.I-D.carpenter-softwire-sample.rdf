    <title>"Legacy NAT Traversal for IPv6: Simple Address Mapping for Premises Legacy Equipment (SAMPLE)", Brian Carpenter, Sheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-carpenter-softwire-sample-00.txt</link>
    <description>IPv6 deployment is delayed by the existence of millions of subscriber network address translators (NATs) that cannot be upgraded to support IPv6.  This document specifies a mechanism for traversal of such NATs.  It is based on an address mapping and on a mechanism whereby suitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity via a stateless server, known as a SAMPLE server, operated by their Internet Service Provider.  SAMPLE is an alternative to the Teredo protocol.</description>
