    <title>"An Adaptation Model for Mobile IPv6 support in lowPANs", Ricardo Silva, University Coimbra</title>

    <description>Real deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSN) are rare, and virtually all have considerable limitations when node mobility is concerned.  On one hand, research in WSNs tends to favour complex multi-hop routing protocols and, on the other hand, IP and mobility are considered too demanding for these environments.  In this document we contradict this general belief by proposing an adaptation model for Mobile IPv6 in 6lowPANs.</description>
