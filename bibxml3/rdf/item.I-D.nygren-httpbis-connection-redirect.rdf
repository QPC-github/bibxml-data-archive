    <description>This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to provide hints in its HTTP responses to a user-agent that indicate the user could be better off connecting to a different IP than what they are currently connected to.  This is highly relevant in a multi-homed server world where DNS may not have all of the relevant state necessary to make a proper routing decision.  Additionally it is done in a manner that does not require application level changes as could be the case for an application level redirect such as a 3xx response</description>
