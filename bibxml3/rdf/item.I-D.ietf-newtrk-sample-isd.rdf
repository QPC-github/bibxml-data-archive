    <description>The proposal to define what is actually an IETF standard and to create ways of explaining and qualifying its applicability and relationship to other documents has been described in an Internet-Draft, "Internet Standards Documentation (ISDs)" (draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd-00). This document provides some examples of what such documents might look like. It includes a very complicated example (SMTP) and a fairly simple one (the IMAP/POP authorization specification of RFC 2195, which has not progressed beyond Proposed Standard).</description>
