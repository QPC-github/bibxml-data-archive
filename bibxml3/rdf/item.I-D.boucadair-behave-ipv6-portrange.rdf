    <description>This memo presents a solution to solve IPv4 address shortage and ease IPv4-IPv6 interconnection.  The document presents a set of incremental steps for the deployment of IPv6 as a means to solve IPv4 address exhaustion.  Stateless IPv4/IPv6 address mapping functions are introduced and IPv4-IPv6 interconnection scenarios presented. This memo advocates for a more proactive approach for the deployment of IPv6 into operational networks.  This memo specifies the IPv6 variant of the A+P. Both encapsulation and translation scheme are covered.  Moreover, two modes are elaborated: the binding mode (compatible mode with DS-lite) and the stateless mode.</description>
