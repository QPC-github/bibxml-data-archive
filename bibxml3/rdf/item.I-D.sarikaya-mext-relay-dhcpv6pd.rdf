    <description>This document defines DHCP Relay Agent based prefix delegation support for a mobile network.  Mobile Router uses DHCPv6 prefix delegation to dynamically request its Mobile Network Prefixes from DHCP Server.  DHCP Relay Agent located in MR enables MR to run the prefix delegation application with the same DHCP Server even after MR moves to a different local network.</description>
