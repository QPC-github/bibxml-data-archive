    <description>There is an increased demand of trustworthy claim sets -- a set of system entity characteristics tied to an entity via signatures -- in order to provide information.  Claim sets represented via CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) can compose a variety of evidence suitable for constrained-node networks and to support secure device automation. This document focuses on sets of identifiers and attributes that are tied to a system entity and are typically used to compose identities appropriate for Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) authentication needs.</description>
