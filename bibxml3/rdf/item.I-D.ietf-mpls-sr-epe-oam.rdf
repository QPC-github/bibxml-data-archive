        <description>Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) is an application of Segment Routing to Solve the problem of egress peer selection.  The Segment Routing based BGP-EPE solution allows a centralized controller, e.g. a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller to program any egress peer. The EPE solution requires a node to program the PeerNode Segment Identifier(SID) describing a session between two nodes, the PeerAdj SID describing the link (one or more) that is used by sessions between peer nodes, and the PeerSet SID describing an arbitrary set of sessions or links between a local node and its peers.  This document provides new sub-TLVs for EPE Segment Identifiers (SID) that would be used in the MPLS Target stack TLV (Type 1), in MPLS Ping and Traceroute procedures.</description>
