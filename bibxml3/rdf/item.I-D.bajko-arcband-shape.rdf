    <title>"Arcband Shape Binary Encoding", Gabor Bajko, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bajko-arcband-shape-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a binary encoding format for an arcband, which is compatible with the binary encoding defined by 3GPP [3GPP23.032], and which is widely used in today's cellular networks. This encoding can additionally be used by a number of other protocols, which demand a bandwidth efficient encoding of location information, eg link layers like IEEE 802.11.</description>
