    <title>"Nonce response matching for router reachability in IPv6", Greg Daley</title>

    <description>IPv6 Neighbour Discovery does not provide a mechanism which allows a node to match its router solicitations to advertised responses. The Nonce Neighbour Discovery Option was originally defined for Secured Neighbour Discovery. This draft describes the use of the Nonce Option for generic router reachability testing.</description>
