    <title>"Kerberos Service Discovery using DNS", Nathaniel McCallum, Matt Rogers</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mccallum-kitten-krb-service-discovery-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes defines a new mechanism for discovering Kerberos services using DNS.  This new mechanism extends the mechanism already defined in Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] and has four goals.  First, reduce the number of DNS queries required to discover a Kerberos KDC.  Second, provide DNS administrators more control over client behavior.  Third, provide support for discovery of the MS- KKDCP transport.  Fourth, define a discovery procedure for Kerberos password services.</description>
