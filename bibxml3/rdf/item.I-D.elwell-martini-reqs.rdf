    <title>"Requirements for multiple address of record (AOR) reachability information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", John Elwell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-martini-reqs-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration mechanism for multiple addresses of record, the mechanism being suitable for deployment by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized PBXs.  The requirements are for a solution that can, as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.  This work is being discussed on the martini@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
