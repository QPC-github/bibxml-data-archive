    <description>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring.  Multiple anchors and nodes are configured with appropriate mobility functions and work together to enable mobility solutions.  Example solution is mid-session switching of the IP prefix anchor.  Without ongoing session requiring session continuity, a flow can be started or re- started using the new IP prefix which is allocated from the new network and is therefore anchored to the new network.  With ongoing session, the anchoring of the prior IP prefix may be relocated to the new network to enable session continuity.</description>
