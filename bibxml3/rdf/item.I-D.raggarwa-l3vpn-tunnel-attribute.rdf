    <title>"Signaling Tunnel Identifiers and Capabilities in BGP", Rahul Aggarwal</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-raggarwa-l3vpn-tunnel-attribute-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a mechanism that allows a router to signal the identifiers of IP/MPLS Tunnels, for which it is the headend, using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). One application of this mechanism is multicast in BGP - Multi-Protocol-Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This document also proposes a mechanism that allows a router to signal its tunnel enapsulation/decapsulation capabilities using BGP. One application of this is signaling MPLS upstream label assignment capability when BGP is used to advertise MPLS upstream assigned labels.</description>
