    <description>This document aims to make protocol designers aware of privacy- related design choices and offers guidance for developing privacy considerations for IETF documents.  While specifications cannot police the implementation community, nonetheless protocol architects must play in the improvement of privacy, both by making a conscious decision to design for privacy, and by documenting privacy risks in protocol designs.  This document is discussed on the Internet Privacy Discussion mailing list (see https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy).</description>
