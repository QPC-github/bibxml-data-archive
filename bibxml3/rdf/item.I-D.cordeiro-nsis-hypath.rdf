    <description>In a multi-domain Internet that offers QoS guaranties for applications, there is the need of signaling among the domain entities that are responsible for the management of QoS.  Because different domains have different network protocols and topologies, the HyPath approach uses the NSIS protocol and interactions with the local routing protocols to have an off-path signaling in hybrid environments.</description>
