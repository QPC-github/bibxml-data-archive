    <description>In Ethernet based aggregation networks, several subscriber premises may be logically connected to the same interface of an edge router. This document proposes a method for the edge router to identify the subscriber premises using the contents of the received Router Solicitation messages.  The applicability is limited to broadband network deployment scenarios where multiple user ports are mapped to the same virtual interface on the edge router.</description>
