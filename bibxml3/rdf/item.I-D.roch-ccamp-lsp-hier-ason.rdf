    <title>"Extensions to Hierarchical LSPs for ASON identifiers support", Evelyne Roch, Thierry Marcot, Lyndon Ong</title>

    <description>A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of hierarchical Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER]. However, support of address separation as allowed by the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) architecture [G.8080] is not covered by [HIER]. This internet draft describes additional requirements to consider for the use of LSP hierarchy in ASON networks and proposes extensions to address those requirements.</description>
