    <title>"Why SIP should be used for encoding the P2PSIP Peer Protocol.", Marcia  Zangrilli, Bruse Lowekamp</title>

    <description>The P2PSIP working group's charter charges the group to define a P2PSIP peer protocol that defines how peers "collectively provide for user and resource location in a SIP environment with no or minimal centralized servers." The charter also states that the group may define a peer protocol that is syntactically based on SIP. This document outlines the motivation and merits of using conventional SIP messages as the syntax to encode the P2PSIP peer protocol and discusses arguments made against this design decision.</description>
