    <title>"Lemonade Requirements for Server to Client Notifications", Stéphane Maes, Corby Wilson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-smaes-lemonade-s2c-notification-reqs-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes Lemonade requirements for server to client notifications. These server to client notifications provide information on crucial changes to a client. This document does not assume how notifications are provided to the clients: the client to server notifications may be actively pushed to a client through different mechanisms rather than requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state changes; or they may be polled by the client, still avoiding that the client performs full state comparisons.</description>
