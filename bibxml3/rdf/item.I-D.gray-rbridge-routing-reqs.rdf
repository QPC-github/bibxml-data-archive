    <title>"Routing Requirements in Support of R-Bridges", Eric Gray</title>

    <description>RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows for zero configuration of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise routing, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and the ability to cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The design supports VLANs, allows forwarding tables to be based on RBridge destinations (rather than endnode destinations, allowing internal forwarding tables to be smaller than in conventional bridge systems) and re-uses existing routing protocols (for - at least - distribution of reachability of destinations and shortest path computation within a campus). In order to accomplish this, the design may impose requirements for extensions to existing routing protocols necessary to accomplish the distribution and computation processes, as well as specific limits on interactions between bridge, R-Bridge and Router instances.</description>
