    <title>"An Architecture for IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e", Pascal Thubert, Thomas Watteyne, Robert Assimiti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thubert-6tisch-architecture-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 Multi-Link subnet that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by Backbone Routers.  Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed mode.  The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor Discovery operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same backbone as classical devices.</description>
