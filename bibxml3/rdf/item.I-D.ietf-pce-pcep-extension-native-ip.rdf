        <description>This document defines the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extension for Central Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR) based application in Native IP network.  The scenario and framework of CCDR in native IP is described in [RFC8735] and [RFC8821].  This draft describes the key information that is transferred between Path Computation Element (PCE) and Path Computation Clients (PCC) to accomplish the End to End (E2E) traffic assurance in Native IP network under central control mode.</description>
