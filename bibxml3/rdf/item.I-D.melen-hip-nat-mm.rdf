    <title>"HIP Mobility and Multihoming Extensions for the Traversal of Network Address  Translators", Jan Melen, Miika Komu, Marcelo Bagnulo, Tom Henderson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melen-hip-nat-mm-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines extensions for HIP mobility and multihoming mechanisms to operate in network environments with NAT devices.  The extensions are based on the ICE protocol that allows two communicating end-hosts to establish a direct communications path with each other even when residing in separate private address realms.  The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault- tolerance with symmetric locator pairs, and load-balancing is also discussed.  This document also updates RFC5206.</description>
