    <description>This document specifies how Ethernet VPN (EVPN) can be used as a Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) solution and explores the various tunnel encapsulation options over IP  and their impact on the EVPN control-plane and procedures. In particular, the following encapsulation options are analyzed: Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation (NVGRE), and MPLS over Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). This specification is also applicable to Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (GENEVE) encapsulation; however, some incremental work is required which will be covered in a separate document. This document also specifies new multi-homing procedures for split-horizon filtering and mass-withdraw. It also specifies EVPN route constructions for VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulations and Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) procedures for multi-homing of Network Virtualization (NV) Edge devices.</description>
