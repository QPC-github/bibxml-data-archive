    <title>"Dynamic Authorization Proxying in Remote Authorization Dial-In User Service Protocol (RADIUS)", Alan DeKok, Jouni Korhonen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-radext-coa-proxy-10.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 5176 defines Change of Authorization (CoA) and Disconnect Message (DM) behavior for RADIUS.  That document suggests that proxying these messages is possible, but gives no guidance as to how it is done. This specification updates RFC 5176 to correct that omission for scenarios where networks use Realm-based proxying as defined in RFC 7542.  This specification also updates RFC 5580 to allow the Operator-Name attribute in CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request packets.</description>
