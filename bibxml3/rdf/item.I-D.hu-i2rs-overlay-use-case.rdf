    <description>This document proposes an overlay network use case for interface to routing system (I2RS).  The forwarding routers network is assumed to be an overlay structure.  There are two types of forwarding routers: Edge Router(ER) and Core Routers(CR).  Edge Router encapsulates format data based on the tunnel type, which are established among Edge Routers.  Core Router would be very simple and cheap.  CRs focus on the encapsulation data forwarding.  In order to reduce the overall ER costs, the use of network virtualization is proposed in this document.</description>
