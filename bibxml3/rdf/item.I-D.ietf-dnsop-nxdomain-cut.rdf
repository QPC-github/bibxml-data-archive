    <title>"NXDOMAIN really means there is nothing underneath", Stephane Bortzmeyer, Shumon Huque</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsop-nxdomain-cut-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response with response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain name which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list.  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept at Github [1].  This documents clarifies RFC 1034 and modifies a portion of RFC 2308, so it updates both of them.</description>
