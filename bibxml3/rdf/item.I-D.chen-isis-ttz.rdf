    <description>This document presents a topology-transparent zone in an area.  A zone is a block/piece of an area, which comprises a group of routers and a number of circuits connecting them.  It is abstracted as a virtual entity such as a single virtual node or zone edges mesh.  Any router outside of the zone is not aware of the zone.  The information about the circuits and routers inside the zone is not distributed to any router outside of the zone.</description>
