    <title>"DNSKEY Trust Anchor Key Requirements", Thierry Moreau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moreau-dnsext-tak-req-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft attempts to fill a portion of the gap between DNSSEC deployment expectations and the lack of DNSSEC trust anchor key management solutions, protocol and procedural aspects. Specific requirements are stated at a level of abstraction that should accommodate solution alternatives to the issues of providing trust anchor keys to DNSSEC-aware resolvers, and rolling those keys. Nonetheless, the characteristics the DNSSEC protocols and the DNS operation contingencies do shape many of the requirements.</description>
