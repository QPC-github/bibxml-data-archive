    <description>Internet service aimed at advance resource reservation for QoS based applications using QoS managers interacting with IntServ/RSVP and Differentiated Service architectures is proposed. Different issues such as resource reservation, timing of requests and dependency of reservations are considered in the advance resource reservation interface. Abstract interface describing the advance resource reservation requests is specified. Mechanisms for advance resource reservation are discussed.</description>
