    <title>"IPv6 Subnet Anycast Deprecated", Randy Bush</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ymbk-no-subnet-anycast-00.txt</link>
    <description>IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not used operationally, complicates implementations, and complicates protocol specifications.  The form of anycast actually used in the Internet is routing-based, and is essentilly the same as that of IPv4 anycast.  Therefore, this document deprecates IPv6 Subnet Anycast.  This is an early draft and will require non-trivial fill-in and details.</description>
