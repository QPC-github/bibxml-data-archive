    <title>"IGP Extensions for Segment Routing Capable PCE Discovery", Siva Sivabalan, Jan Medved</title>

    <description>When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or a server participating in IGP, its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised using IGP flooding.  Such IGP extensions exist for OSPF and ISIS to advertise several such capabilities.  Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling pardigms in which a node steers a packet through the network using segments.  A segment can be an MPLS label or IPv6 header with a new extension.  In SR networks, a PCE can be used to compute paths using SR PCEP extension.  This document specifies additional capability to advertise a PCE that supports the new SR PCEP extension.</description>
