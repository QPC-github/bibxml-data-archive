    <title>"MPL Forwarder Select (MPLFS)", Peter Van der Stok, Abdur Sangi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vanderstok-roll-mpl-forw-select-01.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes a Forwarder Selection (MPLFS) protocol for the Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and lossy Networks (MPL) to reduce the density of forwarders such that the number of forwarded messages is reduced.  The protocol uses Trickle to distribute link- local information about the identity of the neighbours of the nodes that have MPL-enabled interfaces.  In the end-state all nodes are connected to a minimum number, N_DUPLICATE, of forwarders, where N_DUPLICATE is application dependent, and there is a path between any two forwarders.</description>
