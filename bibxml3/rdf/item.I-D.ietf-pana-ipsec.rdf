    <description>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a protocol for authenticating clients to the access network using IP based protocols.  The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at the end of a successful authentication. This document discusses the details for establishing an IPsec security association using the PANA security association for enabling IPsec based access control.</description>
