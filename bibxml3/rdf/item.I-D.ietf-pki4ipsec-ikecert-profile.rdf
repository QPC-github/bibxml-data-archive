    <title>"The Internet IP Security PKI Profile of IKEv1/ISAKMP, IKEv2, and PKIX", Brian Korver</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pki4ipsec-ikecert-profile-12.txt</link>
    <description>IKE and PKIX certificate profile both provide frameworks that must be profiled for use in a given application. This document provides a profile of IKE and PKIX that defines the requirements for using PKI technology in the context of IKE/IPsec. The document complements protocol specifications such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, which assume the existence of public key certificates and related keying materials, but which do not address PKI issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues. The intended audience is implementors of PKI for IPsec.</description>
