    <title>"Common Interface to Cryptographic Modules (CICM) Logical Model", Daniel Lanz, Lev Novikov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lanz-cicm-lm-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an abstract model for high assurance cryptographic modules.  It defines the relevant terminology and high- level descriptions of the types of services and operations offered by such modules.  The goal is to provide a common vocabulary for discussing the programming of high assurance modules.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at cicm@ietf.org.</description>
