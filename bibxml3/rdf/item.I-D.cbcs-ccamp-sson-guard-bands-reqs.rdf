    <description>The continuous increase of flexibility and bit rate in optical networks has higher and higher impacts on inter-channel effects (e.g. Cross-phase modulations).  This effect leads to the introduction of Guard Bands between adjacent light paths in order to reduce the inter-channel detrimental effects.  This document provides requirements for the devolpment of protocol extensions to support Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and Path Computation Element (PCE) management of Guard Bands.</description>
