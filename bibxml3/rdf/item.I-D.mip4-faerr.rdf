    <title>"Foreign Agent Error Extension for Mobile IPv4", Charles Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mip4-faerr-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents operating Mobile IP for IPv4. The new extension option allows a foreign agent to supply an error code without disturbing the data supplied by the Home Agent within the Registration Reply message. In this way, the mobile node can verify that the Registration Reply message was generated by the Home Agent even in cases where the foreign agent is required by protocol to insert new status information into the Registration Reply message.</description>
