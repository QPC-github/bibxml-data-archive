    <title>"Proposal for a Network-Friendly HTTP Upgrade", Willy Tarreau, Amos Jeffries, Andrien de Croy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tarreau-httpbis-network-friendly-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an upgrade to HTTP messaging which aims at being faster, more robust and more friendly to mobile networks than the current version, while retaining the same semantics and offering a high enough compatibility level to make it possible to implement highly efficient gateways between existing implementations and this presently described version, thus offering a smooth upgrade path for legacy applications.</description>
