    <description>SS7 ISUP [3] defines a Calling Party's Category (CPC) parameter that characterizes the station used to originate a call and carries other important state that can describe the originating party. Based on the CPC parameter from the calling network, the called network can do some special processes related to the calling party category, just like override the calee's DND and some other barring services. This document specifies a way to deliver the calling party category to implement some supplementary services derived from the PSTN network.</description>
