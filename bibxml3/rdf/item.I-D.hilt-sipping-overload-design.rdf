    <title>"Design Considerations for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Overload  Control", Volker Hilt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hilt-sipping-overload-design-00.txt</link>
    <description>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when SIP servers have insufficient resources to handle all SIP messages they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This document discusses models and design considerations for a SIP overload control mechanism.</description>
