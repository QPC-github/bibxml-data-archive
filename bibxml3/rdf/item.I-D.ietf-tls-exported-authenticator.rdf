        <description>This document describes a mechanism that builds on Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and enables peers to provide a proof of ownership of an identity, such as an X.509 certificate.  This proof can be exported by one peer, transmitted out-of-band to the other peer, and verified by the receiving peer.</description>
