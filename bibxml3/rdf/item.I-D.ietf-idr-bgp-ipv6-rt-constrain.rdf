    <description>The current route target distribution specification as described in [RFC 4684] defines Route Target NLRIs of maximum length of 12 bytes. The IPv6 specific Route Target extended community is defined in [RFC 5701] as length of 20 bytes.  Since the current specification only supports prefixes of maximum length of 12 bytes, the lack of an IPv6 specific Route Target reachability information may be a problem when an operator wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment. This document defines an extension that allows BGP to exchange longer length IPv6 Route Target prefixes.</description>
