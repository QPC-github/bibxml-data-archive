    <title>"HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states -- Memento", Herbert Van de Sompel, Michael Nelson, Robert Sanderson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vandesompel-memento-11.txt</link>
    <description>The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps.  Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime.  TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource.  The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.</description>
