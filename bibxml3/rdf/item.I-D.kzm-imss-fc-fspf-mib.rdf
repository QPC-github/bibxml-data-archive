    <title>"MIB for Fibre-Channel's Fabric Shortest Path First Protocol", Claudio  DeSanti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kzm-imss-fc-fspf-mib-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel network's Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) routing protocol. At present, this memo is in development as part of the SM-FSM project of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</description>
