    <description>The authors are developing COAP and IPv6-based sensor networks for environments where lightweight implementations, long battery lifetimes, and minimal management burden are important.  The memo shows how different communication models supported by COAP affect implementation complexity and energy consumption, far more so than mere changes in message syntax.  Our prototype implements a multicast-based IPv6, UDP, COAP, and XML protocol stack in less than 50 assembler instructions.  While this extremely minimal implementation is suitable only for limited applications and makes a number of assumptions, the general conclusions point to need for further work in developing the COAP multicast and observation frameworks.</description>
