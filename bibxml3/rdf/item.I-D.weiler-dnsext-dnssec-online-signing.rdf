    <title>"Minimally Covering NSEC Records and DNSSEC On-line Signing", Samuel Weiler, Johan Ihren</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-weiler-dnsext-dnssec-online-signing-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records that cover a smaller range of names than called for by [-records]. By generating and signing these records on demand, authoritative name servers can effectively stop the disclosure of zone contents otherwise made possible by walking the chain of NSEC records in a signed zone.</description>
