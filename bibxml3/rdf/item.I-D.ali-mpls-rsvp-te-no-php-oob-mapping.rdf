    <title>"Non PHP Behavior and out-of-band mapping for RSVP-TE LSPs", Zafar Ali</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ali-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-01.txt</link>
    <description>There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to receive binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload identification, using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document proposes protocol mechanisms to address this requirement. The procedures described in this document are equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to- multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.</description>
