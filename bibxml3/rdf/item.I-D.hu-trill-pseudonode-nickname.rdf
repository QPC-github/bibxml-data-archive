    <description>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology. Active-active access at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. In this document, the edge RBridge (TRILL switch) group providing active-active access to such an end station can be represented as a Virtual RBridge. Based on the concept of Virtual RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname, this document facilitates the TRILL active-active access of such end stations.</description>
