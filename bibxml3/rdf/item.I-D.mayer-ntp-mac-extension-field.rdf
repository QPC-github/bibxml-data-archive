    <title>"The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) MAC Extension Field", Danny Mayer, Harlan Stenn</title>

    <description>The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines in RFC5905 the optional usage of Message Authentication Code (MAC). The MAC is an optional component of the NTP packet at the end of the packet. There can only be one MAC segment in the packet but there is no way of knowing if the last data segment at the end of an NTP packet is a MAC or an extension field, which is also defined in RFC5905. This draft defines a MAC extension field which will allow the existing MAC segment to be moved into an extension field and have a known length and deprecates the existing MAC.</description>
