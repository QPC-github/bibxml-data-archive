    <description>This document discusses how Ethernet Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) in order to reduce the number of BGP MAC advertisement routes by aggregating Customer/Client MAC (C-MAC) addresses via Provider Backbone MAC address (B-MAC), provide client MAC address mobility using C-MAC aggregation, confine the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows, offer per site policies and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology changes. The combined solution is referred to as PBB-EVPN.  Conventions</description>
