    <title>"DES and IDEA Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Pasi Eronen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-des-idea-02.txt</link>
    <description>TLS specification versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346) included cipher suites based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) and IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) algorithms.  DES (when used in single-DES mode) and IDEA are no longer recommended for general use in TLS, and have been removed from TLS 1.2 main specification (RFC 5246).  This document specifies these cipher suites for completeness, and discusses reasons why their use is no longer recommended.</description>
