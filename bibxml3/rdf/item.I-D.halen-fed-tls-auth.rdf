        <description>This document describes how to establish a secure end-to-end channel between two parties within a federation, where both client and server are mutually authenticated.  The trust relationship is based upon a trust anchor held and published by the federation.  A federation is a trusted third party that inter-connect different trust domains with a common set of policies and standards.</description>
