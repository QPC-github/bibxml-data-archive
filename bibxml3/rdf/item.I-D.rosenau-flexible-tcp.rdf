    <title>"The Flexible Transmission Control Protocol (FTCP)", Martin Rosenau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenau-flexible-tcp-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a protocol that may be used as replacement for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  The protocol allows changing the lower-layer address (such as IP address) or even a change or the lower-layer protocol (e.g. from IPv4 to IPv6) in the middle of the connection.  Use cases are private peer-to-peer applications (such as computer games) or mobile communication.</description>
