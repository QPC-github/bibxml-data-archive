    <description>This document proposes an approach to flood ISIS link state protocol data units on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete ISIS topology per underline physical network, so that the amount of flooding traffic in the network is greatly reduced, and it would reduce convergence time with a more stable and optimized routing environment.  The approach can be applied to any network topology in a single ISIS area.</description>
