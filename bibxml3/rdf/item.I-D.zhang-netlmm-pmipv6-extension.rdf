    <description>The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for registration, de-registration and handover into account in the first protocol release. When a mobile node connects to the access networks through a sole interface or multiple interfaces, the condition of the access networks should be considered to improve the performance of the ongoing applications. According to the normal operation, Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) can not get enough information to do the necessary scheduling with Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and Mobile Node (MN), such as flow distribution. This document defines a PMIPv6 extension that carries network condition in the form of simple class indication which is calculated and sent from MAG to LMA in the Access Technology Type option.</description>
