    <title>"RADIUS Attribute for Softwire Concentrator in IPv6 Transition", Dayong Guo, Sheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-guo-radext-softwire-concentrator-00.txt</link>
    <description>6rd and DS-Lite are two most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co- existing period. Both mechanisms need to configure the softwire concentrator information on the host. In many networks, the information may be stored in AAA servers while user configuration is mainly through DHC protocol. This document defines several RADIUS attributes that carries softwire concentrator information.</description>
