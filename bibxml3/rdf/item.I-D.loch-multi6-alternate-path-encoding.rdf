    <title>"IPv6 Multihoming with Alternate Path Encoding", Kevin Loch</title>

    <description>This memo provides a method for multihoming IPv6 networks. A multihomed site assigns IPv6 interface addresses using some of the network bits from one or more alternate networks. IPv6 routers may use this encoded path information when making routing decisions. If a sufficient number of IPv6 routers use this method then benefits of multihoming can be realized by any multihomed IPv6 site. This method may also be used for separate site load distribution as a limited form of anycast.</description>
