    <title>"SACM ECP Recommendations", Daniel Haynes, Charles Schmidt, Jessica Fitzgerald-McKay</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-haynes-sacm-ecp-recommendations-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document builds off of [I-D.fitzgeraldmckay-sacm-endpointcompliance] and [I-D.haynes-sacm-ecp-mapping] to provide high-level recommendations for which Trusted Computing Group [TCG] Endpoint Compliance Profile [Endpoint-Compliance-Profile] specifications might be most productively brought into the IETF SACM Working Group (WG).  Each section considers the alignment of an ECP specification with SACM, how the specification could be leveraged by SACM as well as potential modifications, and suggests a prioritization of specifications for submission to the SACM WG.</description>
