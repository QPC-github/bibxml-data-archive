    <title>"MANET Router Configuration Recommendations", Thomas Clausen, Ulrich Herberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-clausen-manet-autoconf-recommendations-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a pragmatic set of configuration recommendations for MANETs, as well as provides a rationale for why these recommendations are sound.  While there may be other equally valid ways of configuring a MANET, the recommendations in this document have the merit of being supported by an existence proof (there're running networks in existence, configured according to these recommendations), and they require neither modifications to the IP stack nor to upper-layer protocols or applications.</description>
