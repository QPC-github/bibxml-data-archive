    <title>"Traffic Engineering Extensions to OSPF for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Control of SONET/SDH Networks", Lyndon Ong, Andrew Malis, Remi Theillaud</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ong-ccamp-gmpls-ospf-sdh-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with the work on Technology Agnostic OSPF Traffic Engineering Extensions for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV]. These formats are based on previous experience prototyping and testing control plane for ASON networks and are proposed for adoption as a Standards Track RFC for support of ASON routing.</description>
