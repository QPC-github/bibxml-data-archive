    <title>"Operator-Assisted Relay Service Architecture(OARS)", Aijun Wang, Bing Liu, Justin Uberti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-tram-oars-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture called OARS which could simplify the data communication process between two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices.  The key mechanism in OARS is the newly defined "Couple" operation (using STUN [RFC5389] message format) which allows the Relay servers to be easily incorporated into existing CGN/CDN nodes which are already deployed within the network in a distributed manner.
