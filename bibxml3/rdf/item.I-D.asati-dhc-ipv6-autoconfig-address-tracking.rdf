    <title>"Tracking of Static/Autoconfigured IPv6 addresses", Rajiv Asati, Dan Wing</title>

    <description>Network operators commonly use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assign IP addresses to the hosts, and track them. However, the tracking capability is lost when stateless autoconfiguration or manual methods are used to assign IPv6 addresses.  This document proposes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) based mechanism that the last hop router can use to convey the hosts' IPv6 addresses for the tracking and logging purposes, without requiring any changes to the hosts.</description>
