    <description>Integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) with IPsec (ROHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.  However, in order to integrate ROHC with IPsec, extensions to the SPD and SAD are required.  This document describes the IPsec extensions required to support ROHCoIPsec.</description>
