    <title>"Switch Testing for Streaming Media Applications", James Welch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-welch-streaming-test-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines a set of supplementary tests for networking interconnection devices (switches) that can be used to evaluate and compare their performance when used with streaming media. The Media Delivery Index (MDI) [i3] measurement is employed as a convenient stream quality indicator of input and output streams to indicate cumulative stream jitter and packet loss under test load conditions. Typical operating profiles are defined to focus test efforts on common switch applications for unidirectional streaming media to reduce the amount of testing required and to encourage device and system evaluation in advance of deployment through use of a set of reference tests. The supplementary tests defined in this memo are intended for Information only.</description>
