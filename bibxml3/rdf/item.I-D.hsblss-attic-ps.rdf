    <description>This document attempts to make the case for new work involving possibly a framework and protocols that need to be developed to be used among various virtualized functions and the end user which may be moving.  First a set of functional requirements are developed and then these requirements are further elaborated in terms of potential engineering and design constraints.  The need for the new work is described next.</description>
