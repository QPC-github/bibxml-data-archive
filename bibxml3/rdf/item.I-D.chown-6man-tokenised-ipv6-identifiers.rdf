    <description>This text is intended to open discussion towards the adoption of support for tokenised IPv6 interface identifiers in IPv6 nodes.  The primary target for such support is server platforms where addresses are usually manually configured, rather than using DHCPv6 or SLAAC. By using tokenised identifiers, hosts can still determine their network prefix by use of SLAAC, but more readily be automatically renumbered should their network prefix change.</description>
