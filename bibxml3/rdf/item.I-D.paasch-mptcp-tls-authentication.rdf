    <title>"TLS Authentication for MPTCP", Christoph Paasch, Alan Ford</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-paasch-mptcp-tls-authentication-00.pdf</link>
    <description>Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [4], is an extension to TCP to provide the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication specifies "application layer authentication" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively negotiated keying mechanism for MPTCP.  This allows keying material to be sourced from an application layer protocol in order to secure MP_JOIN handshakes.  This document explains how to use the proposed application-layer authentication extension with TLS [6], in order to leverage securely exchanged keys for MPTCP security, whilst simultaneously freeing the MPTCP token to be used as a channel for additional information.</description>
