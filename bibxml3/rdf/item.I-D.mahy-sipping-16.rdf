    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become very popular, and with this popularity, the harmful misconceptions that there is a specific limit to the number of features that can be implemented using SIP primitives, and that informational documents produced by the SIPPING Working Group that show example call flows place restrictions on what can be implemented. One especially catchy buzzword--The "SIPPING 16"--supposedly refers to the sixteen basic features of SIP. This document describes why the mythical SIPPING 16 does not exist, and where to find out more information about SIP features.</description>
