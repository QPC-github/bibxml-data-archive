    <title>"Virtual IPv6 Connectivity for IPv4-Only Networks", Christian Vogt, Alain Durand</title>

    <description>Although the impetus to invest in interworking between IP versions 4 and 6 is initially on the side of early IPv6 adopters, more substantial IPv6 deployment in the future will shift this impetus towards the side of the legacy IPv4 Internet.  However, interworking techniques for IPv4-only networks are as yet largely unexplored. This document proposes Virtual IPv6 Connectivity, a technique for IPv4-only networks to communicate with the IPv6 Internet.</description>
