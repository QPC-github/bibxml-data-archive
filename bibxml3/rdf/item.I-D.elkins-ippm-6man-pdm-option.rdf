    <description>To assess performance problems,  measurements based on optional sequence numbers and timing may be embedded in each packet.  Such measurements may be interpreted in real-time or after the fact. An implementation of the existing IPv6 Destination Options extension header, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Options extension header as well as the field limits, calculations, and usage of the PDM in measurement are included in this document.</description>
