    <description>This document defines new options for Broadcast and Multicast Service controller discovery in an IP network. Broadcast service is being developed for 3G wireless networks. Users of the service interact with a controller in the network to derive informations that are required to receive broadcast service. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol can be used to configure the controller IPv4 addresses or fully qualified domain names in the user's devices. This document defines the related options and option codes.</description>
