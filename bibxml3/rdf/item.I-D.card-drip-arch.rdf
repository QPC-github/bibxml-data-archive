    <title>"Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Architecture", Stuart Card, Adam Wiethuechter, Robert Moskowitz, Shuai Zhao</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-card-drip-arch-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an architecture for Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services to support Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification (UAS RID) and RID- related communications, including its building blocks and their interfaces, all to be standardized.  CAVEAT LECTOR: This draft version is undergoing substantial restructuring and is submitted to the DRIP WG only to spark discussion on architecture and to be adopted as a placeholder if there is consensus that there should be an architecture document (however far from any future consensus on that architecture this draft may be).</description>
