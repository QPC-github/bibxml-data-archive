    <title>"Additional functions for OSPFv2 extensions for ASON routing", Remi Theillaud, Lyndon Ong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-theillaud-gmpls-ason-routing-add-fcts-01.txt</link>
    <description>[OSPF-ASON] defines OSPFv2 extensions to fulfill the requirements defined in [RFC4258].  In OIF discussion of ASON routing, OIF members have noted that some additional functionality beyond that defined in [OSPF-ASON] would be useful for deployment of ASON routing by OIF carriers.  The purpose of this document is to list such additional functionalities, so that CCAMP experts study whether such functionalities can be fulfilled by existing GMPLS mechanisms, or whether extensions to [OSPF-ASON] are required.  Some proposals for potential extensions are provided for review by IETF CCAMP.</description>
