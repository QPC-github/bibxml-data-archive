    <description>This document enumerates methods of port assignment in Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs), focused particularly on NAT64 environments.  A theoretical framework of different NAT port allocation methods is described.  The memo is intended to clarify and focus the port allocation discussion and propose an integrated view of the considerations for selection of the port allocation mechanism in a given deployment.</description>
