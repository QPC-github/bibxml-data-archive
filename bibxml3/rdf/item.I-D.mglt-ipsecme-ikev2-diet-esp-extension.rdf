    <description>ESP Header Compression (EHC) reduces the ESP overhead by compressing ESP fields.  Compression results from a coordination of various EHC Rules designed as EHC Strategies.  An EHC Strategy may require to be configured with some configuration parameters.  When a Security Association (SA) is enabling EHC, the two peers need to agree which EHC Strategy is applied as well as its associated configuration parameters.  This document describes an extension of IKEv2 that enables two peers to agree on a specific EHC Strategy as well as its associated configuration parameters.</description>
