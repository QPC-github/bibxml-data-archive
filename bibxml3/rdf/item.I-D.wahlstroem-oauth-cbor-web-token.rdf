    <description>CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.  CWT is a profile of the JSON Web Token (JWT) that is optimized for constrained devices.  The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application layer security protection.  A claim is a piece of information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/ value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.</description>
