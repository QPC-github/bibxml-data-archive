    <title>"Algorithm Agility Procedure for RPKI.", Roque Gagliano, Stephen Kent, Sean Turner</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sidr-algorithm-agility-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RPs) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set.  The process is expected to be completed in a time scale of several years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.  The transition procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent migrates before children).</description>
