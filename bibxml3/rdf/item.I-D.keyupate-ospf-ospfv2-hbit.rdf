    <description>OSPFv3 [RFC5340] defines an option field for router-LSAs known as a R-bit.  If the R-bit is clear, an OSPFv3 router can participate in OSPF topology distribution without acting as a forwarder to forward the transit traffic.  In such cases, an OSPF router would only accept traffic intended for local delivery.  This draft defines R-bit functionality for OSPFv2 defined in [RFC2328].</description>
