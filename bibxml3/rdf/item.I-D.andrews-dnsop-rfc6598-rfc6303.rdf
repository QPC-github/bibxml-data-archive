    <title>"Add 100.64.0.0/10 prefixes to IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry.", Mark Andrews</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-andrews-dnsop-rfc6598-rfc6303-03.txt</link>
    <description>RFC6598 specified that: "Reverse DNS queries for Shared Address Space addresses [100.64.0.0/10] MUST NOT be forwarded to the global DNS infrastructure."  This document formally directs IANA to add the associated zones to the "IPv4 Locally-Served DNS Zones Registry" to prevent such queries accidently leaking to the global DNS infrastructure.</description>
