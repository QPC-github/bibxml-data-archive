    <description>In order to support arbitrary network topologies and multi-homing the IETF Homenet Architecture [RFC7368] requires that a routing protocol operates inside each home network.  For interoperability reasons it is necessary for there be a single "mandatory to implement" routing protocol.  With the Homenet Working Group unable to reach clear consensus on which protocol that should be the Working Group Chairs (with the support of the Internet Area Director) declared rough consensus that the chosen protocol is BABEL [RFC6126].  This document (not intended for publication as an RFC) serves as an additional record of that decision.</description>
