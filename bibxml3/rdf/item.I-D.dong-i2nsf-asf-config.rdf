    <title>"Configuration of Advanced Security Functions with I2NSF Security Controller", Wei Pan, Liang Xia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dong-i2nsf-asf-config-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft defines a network security function (NSF-) facing interface of the security controller for the purpose of configuring some advanced security functions.  These advanced security functions include antivirus, anti-ddos, and intrusion prevention system (IPS). The interface is presented in a YANG data model fashion and can be used to deploy a large amount of NSF blocks that all support above mentioned functions in the software defined network (SDN) based paradigm.</description>
