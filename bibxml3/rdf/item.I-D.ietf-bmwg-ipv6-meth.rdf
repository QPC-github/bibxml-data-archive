    <title>"IPv6 Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices", Chip  Popoviciu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-bmwg-ipv6-meth-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Benchmarking Methodologies defined in RFC2544 [9] are IP version independent.  However, RFC 2544 does not address some of the specificities of IPv6.  This document provides additional benchmarking guidelines, which in conjunction with RFC2544, lead to a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance of network interconnect devices. IPv6 transition mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.</description>
