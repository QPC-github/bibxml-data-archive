    <title>"BGP Extensions for Inter-AS Traffic Engineering (TE) Link Distribution", Jie Dong, Mach Chen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dong-idr-inter-as-te-link-distribution-00.txt</link>
    <description>Protocol extensions to Interial Gataway Protocols (IGPs) have been specified for the flooding of Traffice Engineering (TE) information of the Inter-Autonomous System (AS) links into the local AS (RFC 5392 and RFC 5316), in which some information of the inter-AS links needs to be manually configured.  This document proposes BGP extensions for dynamic advertisement of TE information of Inter-AS links between adjacent ASes.  Such mechanism may also be used for the distribution of Inter-AS TE link information to some external entities, such as Path Computation Element (PCE).</description>
