        <description>Application-aware IPv6 Networking (APN6) framework makes use of IPv6 encapsulation in order to convey the application-aware information along with the data packet to the network so to facilitate the service deployment and SLA guarantee.  This document defines the encodings of the application characteristic information, for the APN6 framework, that can be exchanged between an application or a network edge device such as CPE (Customer-Premises Equipment) and the network infrastructure through the use of IPv6 extension headers.</description>
