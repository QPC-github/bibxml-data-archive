    <title>"The Solution of Label Collision Between Multicast and Unicast", Zheng Huang, Yang Yang</title>

    <description>Upstream Label Suggestion and upstream label allocation schemes are introduced and simply defined in [OVER][UPSTREAM]. But it is possible that the same label will be allocated for unicast LSP and multicast LSP on the same link. In upstream label allocation, it solves the collision through layer 2 encapsulation and context-specific label space. But in the Upstream Label Suggestion allocation scheme, the collision can not be solved if downstream LSRs do not support context-specific label space. This document details the solution of label collision between multicast and unicast for the Upstream Label Suggestion allocation scheme.</description>
