    <description>RSVP Extensions are being defined allowing an endpoint to signal alternate "bandwidths" of interest in case the preferred bandwidth is not available and allowing the RSVP routers to collectively establish the reservation with the highest currently achievable bandwidth among the signaled set.  This can be used to achieve efficient dynamic endpoint codec adjustment.  The present document presents a complementary set of extensions, allowing the dynamic bandwidth selection to reflect a different reservation priority for each of the multiple "bandwidth" associated with a reservation.</description>
