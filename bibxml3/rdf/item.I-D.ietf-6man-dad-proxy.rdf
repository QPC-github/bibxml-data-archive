    <description>The document describes a proxy based mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to- multipoint architecture with "split-horizon" forwarding scheme, primarily deployed for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Fiber access architectures.  Based on the DAD signalling, the first hop router stores in a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point- to-multipoint domain (e.g.  VLAN).  When a node performs DAD for an address already used by another node, the first hop router replies instead of this last one.</description>
