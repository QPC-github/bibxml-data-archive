    <description>The IETF has defined a number of technologies and techniques that targets the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.  Documented techniques identify high level use cases and generalized options for networks. Operators may have difficulty attempting to apply the documented techniques to their networks since each network and system operates uniquely within the global Internet.  Operators may require guidance on how to identify the appropriate technology, or technologies, and apply them to their specific environments.  This memo describes the problem statements related to the transition of operator's networks to IPv6.</description>
