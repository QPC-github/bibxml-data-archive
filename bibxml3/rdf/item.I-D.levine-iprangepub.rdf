    <title>"An efficient method to publish ranges of IP addresses in the DNS", John Levine</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levine-iprangepub-02.txt</link>
    <description>The DNS has long been used to publish lists of IPv4 address ranges in blacklists and whitelists.  The size of the IPv6 address space makes the entry-per-IP approach used for IPv4 lists impractical.  A new technique for publishing IP address ranges is described.  It is intended to permit efficient publishing and querying, and to have good DNS cache behavior.</description>
