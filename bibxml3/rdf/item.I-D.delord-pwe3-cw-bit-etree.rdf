    <description>The extension described in this document allows a pair of PEs connected via an Ethernet Pseudowire (PW) to signal via the use of the Control Word (CW) whether the Ethernet frame encapsulated is coming from a Root AC or a Leaf AC. This allows a PE receiving this frame to decide whether it can be forwarded to a Leaf AC or not. Such forward or drop decision is an additional filtering action after the MAC-based forwarding decision. This applies to both P2P PW and P2MP PW.</description>
