    <description>BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) makes use of a subscriber's multiple points of attachment to the Internet to provide the subscriber with higher bandwidth and reliability than what is provided by any single one of these attachments.  Various tunnel based methods have been developed to realize BANANA. This document specifies a throughput-increasing mechanism that can be commonly adopted by bonding tunnels methods. Basically, ingress node adaptively adjusts its load distribution function according to the quality of the bonding tunnels so as to make best use of the bonding bandwidth.</description>
