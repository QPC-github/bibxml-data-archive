    <title>"Converting Annotated RELAX NG Schemas for Use in I-Ds or RFCs", Ladislav  Lhotka</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lhotka-relaxng-to-rfc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a method for annotating XML schemas expressed in the RELAX NG language and transforming them to a form suitable for direct inclusion in an XML source of an I-D or RFC. The XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) stylesheet performing the transformation also automatically generates cross- references between RELAX NG pattern definitions and their references.</description>
