    <description>In this draft, we discuss how to make use of multiple interfaces in a single mobile router. We will focus on the scenario in which each interface is attached to different access network. Especially, we propose how a mobile router selects proper interfaces to provide services to different traffic flows. We suggest a new option carried in IPv6 hop-by-hop options header to maintain and advertise the flow requirment and characteristics. New option contains a service type value and a preference value. A servie type value is used for traffic classification, and a preference value enables mobile router to control the traffic in detail. The propsed multiple interface selection mechanism in a multihomed mobile router (MMR) chooses an appropriate interface for each flow, depending on traffic requirements and access network characteristics.</description>
