        <description>This document describes SPAKE2+, a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol run between two parties for deriving a strong shared key with no risk of disclosing the password.  SPAKE2+ is an augmented PAKE protocol, as only one party has knowledge of the password.  This method is simple to implement, compatible with any prime order group and is computationally efficient.</description>
