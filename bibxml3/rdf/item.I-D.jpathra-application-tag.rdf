    <title>"Classification of traffic using Application Tags", Jagannathan Pathra B, Prabhuraj K</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jpathra-application-tag-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a solution to classify Application-Layer traffic on switches using Application Tags.  The Application Tags can be passed on to other switches in the  Enterprise Network and also to switches in the Service Provider Network.  Thus it provides a mechanism to classify and apply Quality of Service based on the Application-Layer Traffic.  The advantage of this solution is that it requires no hardware upgrade on switch nor any Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) function on the switch.  1. Conventions</description>
