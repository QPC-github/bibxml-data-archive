    <title>"Requirements for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Routing for Automatically Switched  Optical Network (ASON)", Deborah Brungard</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-ason-routing-reqts-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These include support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) connections including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the routing requirements on the GMPLS suite of protocols to support the capabilities and functionalities for an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.</description>
