    <description>This document was written to provide guidance and recommendations to developers building X.509 public-key certification paths within their applications. By following the guidance and recommendations defined in this document, an application developer is more likely to develop a robust X.509 certificate enabled application that can build valid certification paths across a wide range of PKI environments.</description>
