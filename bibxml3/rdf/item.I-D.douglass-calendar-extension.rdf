    <description>This specification introduces a number of new iCalendar properties which are of particular use for event publishers and in social networking.  This specification also defines a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for iCalendar (RFC 5545) to allow for data that is directly pertinent to an event or task to be included with the calendar data.</description>
