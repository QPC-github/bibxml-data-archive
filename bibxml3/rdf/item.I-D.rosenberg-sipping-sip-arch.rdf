    <title>"Architecture and Design Principles of the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Henning Schulzrinne, Jonathan Rosenberg</title>

    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and its many extensions and supporting technologies define a solution for multimedia communications on the Internet. Much of the design and architecture for SIP is based on a key set of architectural principles which, while commonly discussed on mailing lists and other forums, have not been explicitly captured. This document seeks to rectify that gap by outlining the key set of architectural and design principles underlying SIP.</description>
