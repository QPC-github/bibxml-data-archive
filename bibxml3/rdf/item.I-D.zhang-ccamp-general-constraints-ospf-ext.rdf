    <description>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a wide variety of technologies including packet switching (e.g., MPLS), time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, OTN), wavelength (lambdas), and  &lt;Zhang>  Expires March 2011  [page 1]  draft-zhang-ccamp-general-constraints-ospf-ext-00.txt September 2010  spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). In some of these technologies network elements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range limitations on links. This document describes OSPF routing protocol extensions to support these kinds of constraints under the control of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).</description>
