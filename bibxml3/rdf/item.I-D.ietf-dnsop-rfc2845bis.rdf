    <description>This document describes a protocol for transaction level authentication using shared secrets and one way hashing.  It can be used to authenticate dynamic updates to a DNS zone as coming from an approved client, or to authenticate responses as coming from an approved name server.  No recommendation is made here for distributing the shared secrets: it is expected that a network administrator will statically configure name servers and clients using some out of band mechanism.  This document obsoletes RFC2845 and RFC4635.</description>
