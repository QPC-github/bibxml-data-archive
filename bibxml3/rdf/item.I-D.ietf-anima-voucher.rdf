    <description>This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an owner, using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a "voucher".  This document defines an artifact format as a YANG-defined JSON document that has been signed using a CMS structure.  Other YANG- derived formats are possible.  The voucher artifact is normally generated by the pledge's manufacturer (i.e. the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority).  This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.</description>
