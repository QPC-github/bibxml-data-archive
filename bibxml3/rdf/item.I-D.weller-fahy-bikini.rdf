    <description>BikINI is designed to allow multiple client computers to access a mail message store on a central server. It operates over any reliable datastream protocol, but is commonly used over TCP. BikINI is designed to require minimal message parsing by the server, to be 8-bit clean for mail message content, and to be a lighter-weight and easier-to-implement than other remote message access protocols.</description>
