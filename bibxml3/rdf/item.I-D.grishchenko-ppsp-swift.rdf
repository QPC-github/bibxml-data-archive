    <title>"The Generic Multiparty Transport Protocol (swift)", Victor Grishchenko, A. Bakker</title>

    <description>The Generic Multiparty Protocol (swift) is a peer-to-peer based transport protocol for content dissemination. It can be used for streaming on-demand and live video content, as well as conventional downloading. In swift, the clients consuming the content participate in the dissemination by forwarding the content to other clients via a mesh-like structure.  It is a generic protocol which can run directly on top of UDP, TCP, HTTP or as a RTP profile. Features of swift are short time-till-playback and extensibility. Hence, it can use different mechanisms to prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized trackers or Distributed Hash Tables). Depending on the underlying transport protocol, swift can also use different congestion control algorithms, such as LEDBAT, and offer transparent NAT traversal. Finally, swift maintains only a small amount of state per peer and detects malicious modification of content. This documents describes swift and how it satisfies the requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol (PPSP) Working Group's peer protocol.</description>
