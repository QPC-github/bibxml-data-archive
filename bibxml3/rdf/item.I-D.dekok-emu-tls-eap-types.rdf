    <title>"TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3", Alan DeKok</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dekok-emu-tls-eap-types-02.txt</link>
    <description>EAP-TLS [RFC5216] is being updated for TLS 1.3 in [EAPTLS].  Many other EAP [RFC3748] and [RFC5247] types also depend on TLS, such as FAST [RFC4851], TTLS [RFC5281], TEAP [RFC7170], and possibly many vendor specific EAP methods.  This document updates those methods in order to use the new key derivation methods available in TLS 1.3. Additional changes necessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed.</description>
