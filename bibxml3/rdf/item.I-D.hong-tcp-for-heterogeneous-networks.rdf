    <description>Based on incorporating the ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification [RFC3168] and the end-to-end Available Bandwidth Estimation, TCP for heterogeneous networks accommodates a way for TCP sender to be ability of distinguishing the wireless packet losses from the congestion packet losses, as well as estimating of the available bandwidth to adjust transmission rate when the neworks become congested.</description>
