    <title>"BGP Extended Community for QoS Marking", Thomas Knoll</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-knoll-idr-qos-attribute-24.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a simple signalling mechanism for inter- domain QoS marking using several instances of a new BGP Extended Community.  Class based packet marking and forwarding is currently performed independently within ASes.  The new QoS marking community makes the targeted Per Hop Behaviour within the IP prefix advertising AS and the currently applied marking at the interconnection point known to all access and transit ASes.  This enables individual (re-)marking and possibly forwarding treatment adaptation to the original QoS class setup of the respective originating AS.  The extended community provides the means to signal QoS markings on different layers, which are linked together in QoS Class Sets.  It provides inter-domain and cross-layer insight into the QoS class mapping of the source AS with minimal signalling traffic.</description>
