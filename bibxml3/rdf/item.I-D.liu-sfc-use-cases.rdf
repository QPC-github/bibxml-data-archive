    <description>The delivery of value-added services relies on the invocation of advanced Service Functions in a sequential order.  This mechanism is called Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The set of involved Service Functions and their order depends on the service context and other deployment-specific considerations.  Having a single use case document eases the effort of deriving requirements that are to be met by SFC solution(s).  Moreover, it allows to identify commonalities between the various use cases that are of interest.  This document presents a set of general use cases of Service Function Chaining (SFC).</description>
