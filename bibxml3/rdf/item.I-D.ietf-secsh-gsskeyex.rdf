    <title>"GSSAPI Authentication and Key Exchange for the Secure Shell Protocol", Jeffrey Hutzelman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex-10.txt</link>
    <description>The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network. The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to callers in a mechanism-independent fashion. This memo describes methods for using the GSS-API for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines an SSH user authentication method which uses a specified GSSAPI mechanism to authenticate a user, and a family of SSH key exchange methods which use GSSAPI to authenticate a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This memo also defines a new host public key algorithm which can be used when no operations are needed using a host's public key, and a new user authentication method which allows an authorization name to be used in conjunction with any authentication which has already occurred as a side-effect of GSSAPI-based key exchange.</description>
