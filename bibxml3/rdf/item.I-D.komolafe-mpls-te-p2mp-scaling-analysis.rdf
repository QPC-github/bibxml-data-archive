    <description>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed in providers' core networks, and the scaling properties have been analyzed to show how much control state must be maintained to support a full mesh of edge-to-edge point-to-point (P2P) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies and with several different scaling techniques.  Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE LSPs are very interesting to service providers as a means to provide multicast services (such as TV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core MPLS networks. P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs, and service providers need to understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support the network sizes and service levels that they are planning in their P2MP MPLS-TE networks.  This document presents an analysis of the scaling properties MPLS-TE core networks that support P2MP LSPs.</description>
