    <description>This document describes simple and backward compatible extensions to Fast-Reroute (FRR) MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE).  The purpose of these extensions include the following.  These extensions provide a classification of SRLG to support LSP with differing protection requirements.  These extensions allow highly reliable nodes or links, typically resources with redundancy at a lower layer, to be identified to allow LSP to optionally not consider these resources as potential points of failure.</description>
