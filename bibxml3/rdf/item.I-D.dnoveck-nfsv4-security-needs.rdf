        <title>"Security Needs for the NFSv4 Protocols", David Noveck, Chuck Lever</title>

        <description>This document discusses the inadequate approach to security within the family of NFSv4 protocol specifications and proposes steps to correct the situation.  Because the security architecture is similar for all NFSv4 minor versions, we recommend a single new standards- track document to encapsulate NFSv4 security fundamentals, and propose the introduction of several additional security-related documents.</description>
