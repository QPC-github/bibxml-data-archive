    <description>Source route based Extensible IP Network(EIPv4) implementation can efficiently resolve the problem of IP address shortage. It is necessary to provide domain name service in EIPv4 to make it suitable for practical application. Here provides a way to DNS extension for EIPv4. It discusses how to extend the architecture of DNS into two-level extensible IP network architecture to provide query between domain name and IP node position denotation. And a new DNS RR type has been defined for this purpose.</description>
