    <title>"Update to the Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust", Jari Arkko, Ted Hardie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-update-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust. Previously, Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees.  This memo specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately.  This memo updates RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of trustees.  All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are today.</description>
