    <description>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond what the protocol designers envisioned, and while the architectural model generalizes well the protocol itself has a number of features that limit its applicability to applications other than IntServ.  Network Layer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication model and provides a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signaling applications, such as discovery or diagnostics.  It is based on a "two-layer" architecture that divides protocol function into transport and application.  This document describes the transport protocol.</description>
