    <title>"Trait-based Authorization Requirements for the Session Initiation Protocol  (SIP)", Jon Peterson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-trait-authz-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document lays out a set of requirements related to trait-based authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol. While some authentication mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, trait-based authorization provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant in a session. This approach provides a richer framework for authorization, as well as allow greater privacy for users of an identity system.</description>
