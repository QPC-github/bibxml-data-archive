    <title>"A Session-Based Security Model (SBSM) for version 3 of the Simple Network  Management Protocol (SNMPv3)", David Perkins, Wesley Hardaker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardaker-snmp-session-sm-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a Session Based Security Model (SBSM) for use within version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3). The security model is designed to establish a "session" between two interacting SNMPv3 entities, over which SNMP operations can be sent securely. It provides a number of security properties not previously available in defined SNMPv3 security models, such as public key based identity authentication, limited life-time keying, and the ability to make use of previously implemented and deployed security infrastructures for purposes of identification and authentication.</description>
