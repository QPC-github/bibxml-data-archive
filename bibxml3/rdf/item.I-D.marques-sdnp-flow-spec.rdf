    <description>When IP VPNs are used to interconnect end-systems [I-D.marques-l3vpn- end-system] it may be desirable to introduce traffic control rules at a finer level of granularity than an IP destination address.  This document extends the end-system IP VPN specification with support for fine grain traffic classification, filtering and redirection rules.  It applies the existing BGP IP VPN flow specification dissemination mechanism [RFC5575] to end-system IP VPNs in order to provide the ability to control IP packets that match a specific pattern, which may include fields other than the IP destination address.</description>
