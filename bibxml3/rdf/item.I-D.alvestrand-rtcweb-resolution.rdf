    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-alvestrand-rtcweb-resolution-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft offers a proposal for a fragment of the SDP usage rules for RTCWEB: Requirements for supporting resolution negotiation.  It proposes to use SDP both for initial and within-call resolution configuration, and suggests that COP should be mentioned as an optional, not mandatory, mechanism.</description>
