    <description>This document is intended to serve as a reference point for developers and operators implementing the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) within their networks.  This document does not define any new protocols but does define the different reference models for deployment of combined use of SIP and XMPP ("CUSAX") clients and SIP- XMPP interworking to ensure consistency across the community.</description>
