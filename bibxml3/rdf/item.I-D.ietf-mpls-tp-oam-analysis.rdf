    <description>This document provides an overview of the OAM toolset for MPLS based Transport Networks (MPLS-TP).  The toolset consists of a comprehensive set of fault management and performance monitoring capabilities (operating in the data-plane) which are appropriate for transport networks as required in RFC 5860 and support the network and services at different nested levels.  This overview includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions, and of generic mechanisms created in the MPLS data plane to allow the OAM packets run in-band and share their fate with data packets.  The protocol definitions for each of the MPLS-TP OAM tools are defined in separate documents (RFCs or Working Group drafts) which are referenced by this document.</description>
