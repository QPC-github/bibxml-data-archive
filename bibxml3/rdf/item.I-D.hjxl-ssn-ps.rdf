    <description>With the wide deployment of 4G and beyond mobile networks, a great number of cells need high precision frequency and/or time synchronization for their normal operation. It is crucial to manage the synchronization network in a scalable way and simplify the monitoring and operation for synchronization networks. This document analyzes the use cases and requirements in synchronization networks, and provides a problem statement for scalable synchronization networks.</description>
