    <title>"Profiling of DTLS for CoAP-based IoT Applications", Sye Keoh, Sandeep Kumar, Zach Shelby</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-keoh-dice-dtls-profile-iot-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document collects various implementation challenges of DTLS on embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Specially, this document investigate the application features and functionality of DTLS protocol, the fragmentation issue of DTLS Handshake protocol, and the complexity of the DTLS Handshake state machine. A RESTful DTLS Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer is proposed to address the fragmentation issue. The next step is to define a DTLS profile for embedded systems.</description>
