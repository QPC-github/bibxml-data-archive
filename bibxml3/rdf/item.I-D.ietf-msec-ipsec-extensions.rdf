    <title>"Multicast Extensions to the Security Architecture for the Internet  Protocol", Brian Weis, George Gross, Dragan Ignjatic</title>

    <description>The Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol describes security services for traffic at the IP layer. That architecture primarily defines services for Internet Protocol (IP) unicast packets. This document describes how the IPsec security services are applied to IP multicast packets. These extensions are relevant only for an IPsec implementation that supports multicast.</description>
