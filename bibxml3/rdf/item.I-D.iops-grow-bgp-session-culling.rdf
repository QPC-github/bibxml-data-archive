    <description>This document outlines an approach to mitigate negative impact on networks resulting from maintenance activities.  It includes guidance for both IP networks and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).  The approach is to ensure BGP-4 sessions affected by the maintenance are forcefully torn down before the actual maintenance activities commence.</description>
