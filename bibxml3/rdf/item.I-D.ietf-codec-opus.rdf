    <description>This document defines the Opus interactive speech and audio codec. Opus is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even live, distributed music performances.  It scales from low bitrate narrowband speech at 6 kb/s to very high quality stereo music at 510 kb/s.  Opus uses both linear prediction (LP) and the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) to achieve good compression of both speech and music.</description>
