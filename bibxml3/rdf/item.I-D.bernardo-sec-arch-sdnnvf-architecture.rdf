    <description>SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments, and industries. In most recent months, these two novel frameworks created jitters and excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While these are considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most importantly, lower long-term operational expenditures.  They create opportunities for  innovation that engage key players from networks, security, and software to develop new software controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies.  This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches important aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks.  The architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature over time.</description>
