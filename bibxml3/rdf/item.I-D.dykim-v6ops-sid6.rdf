    <title>"Subnet ID Deprecation for IPv6", DY Kim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dykim-v6ops-sid6-00.txt</link>
    <description>Deprecation of the subnet ID in IPv6 networking is proposed; the subnet ID is set to zero so that all nodes in a site carry the same prefix.  While the procedures for neighbor discovery and duplicate address detection have to be changed, possible simplification gains in IPv6 networking including that of intra-site host- and subnet- mobility might be worth the modification.  Site-external behaviors don't change through this modification, enabling incremental deployment of the proposal.  Sites of manageable sizes for which scalability is not much a critical issue might consider the mode of operation proposed in this document.</description>
