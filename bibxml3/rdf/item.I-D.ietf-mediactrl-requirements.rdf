    <description>This document addresses the communication between an application server and media server.  The current work in IETF working groups shows these logical entities but does not address the physical decomposition and the protocol between the entities.  This document presents the requirements for a media server control protocol (MCP) that enables an application server to use a media server.  It will address the aspects of announcements, Interactive Voice Response and conferencing media services.</description>
