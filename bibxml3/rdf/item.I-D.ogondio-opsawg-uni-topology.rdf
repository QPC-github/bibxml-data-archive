    <description>This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract view of the Service Provider network topology containing the points from which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN, SDWAN).  The data model augments the 'ietf-network' data model by adding the concept of service-attachment-points.  The service- attachment-points are an abstraction of the points to which network services (such as L3 VPN or L2 VPN) can be attached.</description>
