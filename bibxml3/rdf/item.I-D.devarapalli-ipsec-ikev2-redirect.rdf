    <description>IKEv2 is a popular protocol for setting up VPN tunnels from a remote location to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in the network behind the gateway.  Currently there is no standard mechanism specified that allows an overloaded VPN gateway to re- direct the VPN client to attach to another gateway.  This document proposes a re-direct mechanism for IKEv2.  The proposed mechanism can also be used for Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to re-direct the mobile node to another home agent.</description>
