    <title>"Multihomed IPv6 prefix delegation, aggregation, and distribution", Fred  Baker, Marla Azinger</title>

    <description>This document presents IETF commentary to the Registry and ISP communities on how to maximize aggregation while supporting multihoming. Multihomed networks fall broadly into two categories, those that are in some senses comparable to an ISP and those that are simply edge networks or VPNs of edge networks. The best solution for multihoming may be different for these differing categories of networks.</description>
