    <title>"I2RS Environment Security Requirements", Daniel Migault, Joel Halpern, Susan Hares</title>

    <description>This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS architecture.  Environment security requirements are independent of the protocol used for I2RS.  As a result, the requirements provided in this document are intended to provide good security practise so I2RS can be securely deployed and operated.  These security requirements are designated as environment security requirements as opposed to the protocol security requirements described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].  The reason to have separate document is that protocol security requirements are intended to help the design of the I2RS protocol whether the environment requirements are rather intended for deployment or implementations.</description>
