    <title>"Hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3", Douglas Steblia, Scott Fluhrer, Shay Gueron</title>

    <description>Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing security even if all but one of the component algorithms is broken. It is motivated by transition to post-quantum cryptography.  This document provides a construction for hybrid key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the TLS IETF mailing list tls@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/dstebila/draft-stebila-tls-hybrid- design.</description>
