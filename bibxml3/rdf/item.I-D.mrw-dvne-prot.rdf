    <title>"Dynamic Virtual Network Engine (DVNE) Protocol", Margaret Wasserman, Padmanabha Nallur</title>

    <description>This document describes the Dynamic Virtual Network Engine (DVNE) protocol.  The DVNE protocol is a signaling protocol between a virtual network node (the DVNE Client) and a configuration server (the DVNE Mediator).  The DVNE protocol is used to authenticate the nodes in a Virtual Network and assist them to setup and release VPN connections directly among themselves.  A DVNE clients can be located anywhere in a private or public network, directly connected or behind one or more levels of NAT.  The DVNE protocol performs client authentication, peer discovery, virtual network address management, and provides all parameters necessary to enable the clients setup a secure VPN connection.  The protocol does not explicitly setup the VPN connection itself.  It only enables the clients to be able to directly setup the VPN connection themselves.</description>
