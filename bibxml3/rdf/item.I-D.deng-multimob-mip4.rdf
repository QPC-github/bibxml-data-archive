    <description>This document provides the solution to optimize the multicast tunneling in mobile IPv4.  This solution will not break the basic bi- directional tunneling multicast solution of MIPv4.  A new multicast foreign agent works as a proxy node for multiple mobile nodes within one limit scope.  Single tunnel is set up between one home agent and one mobile foreign agent for single multicast stream.  A new notification message is created for the communication between home agent and multicast foreign agent.  There is no modification on mobile nodes.</description>
