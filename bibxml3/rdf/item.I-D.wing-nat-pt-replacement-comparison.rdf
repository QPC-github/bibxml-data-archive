    <description>As we approach IPv4 address depletion, the IETF must provide for IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence:  a way for ISPs and enterprises to reduce public IPv4 address consumption and a way for hosts to migrate to IPv6 connectivity -- while providing reasonable access for those IPv6 hosts to access the IPv4 Internet.  This draft compares eight proposals for IPv6 and IPv4 coexistence.</description>
