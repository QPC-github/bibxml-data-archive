    <title>"Pseudo Wire Protection", Ping Pan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pan-pwe3-protection-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism that helps to protect and recover user traffic when carried over pseudo-wires. The mechanism requires some minor modification to the existing pseudo-wire setup procedure, and is fully backward compatible. The proposed mechanism allows the network operators to setup one or multiple backup pseudo-wires to protect a working pseudo-wire. Upon network failure, user traffic can be switched over to the next "best" pseudo-wire base on preference levels. This document first describes the motivation of the work base on the discussions with a number of carriers. Then we define the protocol extension itself.</description>
