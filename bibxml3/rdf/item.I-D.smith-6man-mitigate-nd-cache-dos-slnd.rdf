    <title>"Mitigating IPv6 Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack Using Stateless Neighbor Presence Discovery", Mark Smith</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-smith-6man-mitigate-nd-cache-dos-slnd-06.txt</link>
    <description>One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover whether a specified neighbor is present.  During the neighbor presence discovery process state is created.  A node's capacity for this state can be intentionally exhausted to perform a denial of service attack, known as the "Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack".  This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor presence discovery to prevent this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.</description>
