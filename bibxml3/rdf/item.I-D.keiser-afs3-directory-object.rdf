    <description>Directory lookups in the AFS-3 distributed file system are supported by defining a canonical encoding for a directory object, and transmitting all--or part--of that object from a file server to its clients so that clients may resolve paths into AFS file IDs (FIDs). This memo describes the AFS-3 directory object wire encoding.  Internet Draft Comments  Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.</description>
