    <description>This draft describes the LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT), a hierarchical, distributed database which embodies the delegation of authority to provide mappings from LISP Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to Routing Locators (RLOCs).  It is a statically-defined distribution of the EID namespace among a set of LISP-speaking servers, called DDT nodes.  Each DDT node is configured as "authoritative" for one or more EID-prefixes, along with the set of RLOCs for Map Servers or "child" DDT nodes to which more-specific EID-prefixes are delegated.</description>
