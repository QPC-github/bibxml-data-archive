    <description>The Certificate options for DHCP-PD RFC3633 [4] provide a mechanism to deliver, along with the IPv6 prefix, the certificate or the information needed to obtain a certificate entitling the client router to advertise the prefix delegated to it.  This information is neccesary if Secure Neighbor Discovery RFC3971 [6] is used by the devices connected to the DHCP-PD client router.</description>
