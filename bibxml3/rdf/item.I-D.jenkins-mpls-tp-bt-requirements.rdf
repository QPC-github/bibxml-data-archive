    <title>"BT Requirements for MPLS-TP features", Ben Niven-Jenkins, Simon Fiddian</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jenkins-mpls-tp-bt-requirements-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features based on our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality being defined as part of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within our existing deployed MPLS networks.  This document is not intended to describe all future requirements for MPLS-TP features, only for those features that we have a currently defined requirement for today and which we would like to see priority be given to them when specifying and standardising MPLS-TP within IETF.  These features are required in order to enable us to enhance live, revenue generating services.</description>
