    <description>This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane operation over an IP network.  It is primarily aimed at IPv4, but would work with IPv6 as well if a unified solution is desired.  This document is a derivative work from draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01, to augment or replace the text currently contained in section 5.2.2.  Whether this is published as a stand-alone text, or serves as a focal point to refine the IP design and subsequently remerged with draft- ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01 is a matter for the DETNET WG.</description>
