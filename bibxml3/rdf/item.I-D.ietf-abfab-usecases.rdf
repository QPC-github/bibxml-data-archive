    <description>Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services at present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web- based contexts.  The goal of this document is to document a selection of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB architecture and specifications.</description>
