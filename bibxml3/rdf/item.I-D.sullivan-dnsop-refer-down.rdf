    <title>"Please See Below: Use Only Downward Referrals in the DNS", Andrew Sullivan, Joe Abley</title>

    <description>A server in the Domain Name System can use a mechanism called "referral" to indicate that the server is not authoritative for a given zone, and to redirect the query to another, more appropriate server.  The mechanism was originally specified such that a referral might be to any location in the DNS.  Operational experience indicates dubious value to referrals other than those to zones below the zones for which a server is authoritative.  This memo therefore recommends such referrals and discourages other kinds of referrals.</description>
