    <description>A variety of services, such as NATs, firewalls, or caches, can be embedded in a service provider network or instantiated in data centers attached to the network.  This document proposes extensions to BGP that facilitate discovery of such service instances by interested clients and allows dissemination of service information, such as services capabilities or capacities, thoughtout the network domain.  The proposed extensions allow for optimal routing of requests to service instances that can optimally serve them.</description>
