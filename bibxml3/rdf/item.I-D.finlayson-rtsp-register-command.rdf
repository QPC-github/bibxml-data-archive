    <title>"Notifying RTSP Clients and Proxy Servers About Streams: The RTSP "REGISTER" Command", Ross Finlayson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-finlayson-rtsp-register-command-02.txt</link>
    <description>We define a new RTSP command - named "REGISTER" - that allows a server (or a third party) to notify a RTSP client or a RTSP proxy server about a RTSP stream (given by a "rtsp://" URL).  This also provides a mechanism whereby a client (or proxy server) on the public Internet can access a RTSP server that is behind a firewall or NAT.</description>
