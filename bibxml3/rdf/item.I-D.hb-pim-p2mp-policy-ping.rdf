        <description>SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for P2MP service delivery.  A P2MP Policy consists of candidate paths that connects the Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves.  The P2MP policy is composed of replication segments.  A replication segment is a forwarding instruction for a candidate path which is downloaded to the Root, transit nodes and the leaves.  This document describes a simple and efficient mechanism that can be used to detect data plane failures in P2MP Policy Candidate Paths (CPs) and Path Instances (PIs).</description>
