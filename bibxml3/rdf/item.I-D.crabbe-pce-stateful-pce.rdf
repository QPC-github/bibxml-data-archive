    <description>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for synchronization or PCE control of timing and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions.  This document describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable this functionality, providing stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP.</description>
