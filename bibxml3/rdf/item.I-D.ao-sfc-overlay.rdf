    <description>Service Function Chain (SFC) network presents a distinct network layer.  As such, it is carried over by an underlay network.  The document reviews two interworking scenarios between the SFC domain and its underlay network - co-located and stand-alone.  The document also defines necessary interworking between stand-alone Network Virtual Edge and Service Forwarding Function entities to ensure proper handling of SFC traffic by the underlay network.</description>
