    <title>"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Communication  Diversion Information in support of the Communication Diversion (CDIV) Notification (CDIVN) CDIV service", Ranjit Avasarala, Subir Saha, John-Luc Bakker</title>

    <description>3GPP and ETSI TISPAN are defining PSTN/ISDN simulation services and in particular the Communication Diversion (CDIV) using IP Multimedia (IM) core Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service.  As part of CDIV, a (SIP) Event Notification Framework-based mechanism is used for notifying Users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of their incoming communication sessions.  A new event package is proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and receive such notifications.  Users have further capability to define filters controlling the selection, rate and content of such notifications. This SIP event package is applicable to the IMS and may not be applicable to the general Internet.</description>
