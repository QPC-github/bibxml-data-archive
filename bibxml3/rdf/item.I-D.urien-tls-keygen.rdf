    <description>The TLS protocol is widely deployed and used over the Internet. Client and server nodes compute a set of keys called the keys-block, according to a pseudo random function (PRF). This draft proposes a keying infrastructure based on the TLS protocol. It suggests defining an additional Key Distribution Function (KDF) in order to deliver a set of cryptographic keys. In a peer to peer mode keys are directly produced as inputs of the KDF functions. For centralized architectures they are delivered through containers, secured with keys derived from the KDF function.</description>
