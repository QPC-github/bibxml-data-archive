    <title>"Delivering Geographic Location in Host Identity Protocol (HIP)", Feng Cao, David Ward, Hui Deng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cao-hip-geolocation-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new parameter for delivering geographic location in Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  For mobile users using HIP, one generic mechanism is proposed to share or update their geo- location information with either rendezvous servers or their peers. In addition, geo-location privacy is also protected with the help of the ENCRYPTED parameter.</description>
