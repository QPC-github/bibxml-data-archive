    <description>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS- related, service-related and subscriber-related configurations and operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)).  The main goal of this protocol is to allow the NAS to configure, manage and control access equipments including the ability for the access nodes to report information to the NAS.  The present document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter.  This document develops a threat model for ANCP security aiming to decide which security functions are required. Based on this, security requirements regarding the Access Node Control Protocol are defined.</description>
