    <title>"Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization without Home Agent", Georg Hampel, Thierry Klein</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hampel-mext-ro-without-ha-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes extensions to Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), which permit hosts to conduct route optimization (RO) without home agent. These extensions add robustness and flexibility to MIPv6 since mobility can be supported when the home agent becomes temporarily unavailable or when home-agent support is not desirable. These extensions are compliant with all peer-to-peer signaling solutions that are currently supported for RO.</description>
