    <description>Multi-layer Intrusion Tolerance Based On Threshold(MITT) is proposed to solve the problems of maintaining acceptable service, despite existing intrusions. MITT integrates redundancy and variety architectures, and utilizes the threshold secret share schemes to implement the survivability of system and to protect confidential data from compromised service in the presence of intrusions.</description>
