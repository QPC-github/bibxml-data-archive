    <title>"Multipath TCP Address Advertisement", Olivier Bonaventure</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bonaventure-mptcp-addr-00.txt</link>
    <description>Multipath TCP [RFC6824] defines the ADD_ADDR option to allow a host to announce its addresses to the remote host.  In this document we analyze some of the issues with the address advertisement technique defined [RFC6824] and propose some modifications to mitigate these problems.  We also show that the reverse DNS could be an excellent alternative to advertise the stable addresses of a server.</description>
