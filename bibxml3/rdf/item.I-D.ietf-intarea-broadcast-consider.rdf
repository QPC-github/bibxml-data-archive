    <title>"Privacy considerations for protocols relying on IP broadcast and multicast", Rolf Winter, Michael Faath, Fabian Weisshaar</title>

    <description>A number of application-layer protocols make use of IP broadcasts or multicast messages for functions such as local service discovery or name resolution.  Some of these functions can only be implemented efficiently using such mechanisms.  When using broadcasts or multicast messages, a passive observer in the same broadcast/ multicast domain can trivially record these messages and analyze their content.  Therefore, designers of protocols that make use of broadcast/multicast messages need to take special care when designing their protocols.</description>
