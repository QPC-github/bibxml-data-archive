        <description>Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within various topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological or functional sub-paths, called "segments". These segments are advertised by various protocols such as BGP, IS-IS and OSPFv3.  This document defines extensions to BGP Link-state (BGP-LS) to advertise SRv6 segments along with their behaviors and other attributes via BGP.  The BGP-LS address-family solution for SRv6 described in this document is similar to BGP-LS for SR for the MPLS data-plane defined in a separate document.</description>
