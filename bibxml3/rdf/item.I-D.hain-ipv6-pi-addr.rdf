    <title>"An IPv6 Provider-Independent Global Unicast Address Format", Tony Hain</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hain-ipv6-pi-addr-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an IPv6 Provider-Independent global unicast address format for use in the Internet. The address format defined in this document is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [2]. It is designed to facilitate scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple service providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the site. A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers at will without requiring their network to renumber.</description>
