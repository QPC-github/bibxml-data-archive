    <title>"Commentary on the Design of the Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type", Jim Schaad</title>

    <description>The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use of Authenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms.  At the time of the original design there was discussion about the relative location of the authenticated attributes and the encrypted content in the ASN.1 structure.  With the benefits of implementation experience I revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate the decision made.</description>
