    <description>"Traffic Localization" is proposed to release the pressure of backbone mobile networks brought by increasing multimedia applications.  A universal storage protocol is needed to serve the purpose on the edge storage nodes.  As the three candidates, HTTP, NFS and iSCSI are compared concerning their implementation and performance on embeded clients and servers in this paper.  Their differences are discussed based on the experiment, and our suggestion for universal storage protocols on edge storage nodes are put forward.</description>
