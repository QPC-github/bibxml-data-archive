    <title>"A Telephony Gateway REgistration Protocol (TGREP)", Manjunath Bangalore</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-iptel-tgrep-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the Telephony Gateway Registration Protocol (TGREP) for registration of telephony prefixes supported by telephony gateways and soft switches [12]. The registration mechanism can also be used to export resource information. The prefix and resource information can then be passed on to a Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) Location Server, which in turn can propagate that routing information within and between Internet telephony administrative domains (ITAD).  TGREP shares a lot of similarities with the TRIP Protocol. It has similar procedures and Finite State Machine for session establishment. It also shares the same format for messages and a subset of attributes with TRIP.</description>
