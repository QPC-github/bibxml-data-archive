    <title>"Generic Raw Public Key Support for IKEv2", Tero Kivinen, Paul Wouters, Hannes Tschofenig</title>

    <description>The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol did have support for raw public keys, but it only supported RSA Raw public keys.  In constrained environments it is useful to make use of other types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This document updates RFC 7296, adding support for other types of raw public keys to IKEv2.</description>
