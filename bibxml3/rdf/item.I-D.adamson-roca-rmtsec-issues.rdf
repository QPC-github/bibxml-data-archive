    <title>"Security and Reliable Multicast Transport Protocols: Discussions and  Guidelines", Brian Adamson, Vincent Roca</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-adamson-roca-rmtsec-issues-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes some security risks of the Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group set of building blocks and protocols. An emphasis is placed on risks that might be resolved in the scope of transport protocol design. However, relevant security issues related to IP Multicast control-plane and other concerns not strictly within the scope of reliable transport protocol design are also discussed. The document also begins an exploration of approaches that could be embraced to mitigate these risks. The purpose of this document is to provide a consolidated security discussion and provide a basis for further discussion and potential resolution of any significant security issues that may exist in the current set of RMT standards.</description>
