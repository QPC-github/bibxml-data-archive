    <title>"A Distributed Path Computation Model for SDN Controller", Jin Zhao, Yanwei Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhao-pce-distributed-sdn-path-computation-00.txt</link>
    <description>Path computation in a large-scale SDN indeed requires a significant amount of computation load. The SDN controller can easily suffer from performance degradation resulting from the centralized design of control plane.  In this document, we argue the necessity in building a distributed model to speed up the path computation in SDN control plane. With proper consistency model, path computation can be implemented among multiple controllers.</description>
