    <description>This document identifies a minimum set of standards and requirements that must be supported by a Video Relay Service (VRS) Video Access Technology Reference Platform (VATRP)-compliant client and United States Telecommunications Relay Service providers required to be VATRP compliant.  This Relay User Equipment specification only specifies a minimum set of requirements.  It does not prohibit VRS providers or endpoint developers from developing or deploying additional capabilities, provided that doing so will not prevent compliance with the requirements specified here.</description>
