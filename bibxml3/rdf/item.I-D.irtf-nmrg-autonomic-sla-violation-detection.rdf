    <title>"Autonomic Networking Use Case for Distributed Detection of SLA Violations", Jeferson Nobre, Lisandro Granville, Alexander Clemm, Alberto Prieto</title>

    <description>This document describes an experimental use case for autonomic networking concerning monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The use case aims to detect violations of SLAs in a distributed fashion, striving to optimize and dynamically adapt the autonomic deployment of active measurement probes in a way that maximizes the likelihood of detecting service level violations with a given resource budget to perform active measurements, and is able to do so without any outside guidance or intervention.  This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG).  It is published for informational purposes.</description>
