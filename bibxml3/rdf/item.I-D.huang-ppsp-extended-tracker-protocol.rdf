    <description>This document specifies an extension to the PPSP Tracker Protocol - Base Protocol, which complements the core messages of the protocol with Request-Response enhancements  and usages, and with a new DISCONNECT Protocol-level message.  These enhancements and usages are related with the exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such as initial offer/request of participation in multimedia content streaming, content information, peer lists, reports of activity and status, and graceful disconnection from the network. The extension is retro-compatible with the PPSP-TP Base Protocol.</description>
