    <description>QUIC is a new transport protocol that provides low-latency communication and security.  QUIC's key features include faster connection establishment, stream-based multiplexing, improved loss recovery, and no head-of-line blocking.  This document assesses the potential human rights implications emerging from the deployment of QUIC.  The assessment is done based on the methodology articulated in [RFC8280].</description>
