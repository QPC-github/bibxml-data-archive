    <description>The emerging and growing deployment of IPv6 networks will introduce cases where connectivity with IPv4 networks crossing IPv6 transit backbones is desired.  This document describes a mechanism for automatic discovery and creation of IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels via extensions to multi- protocol BGP.  It is targeted at connecting islands of IPv4 networks across an IPv6-only backbone without the need for a manually configured overlay of tunnels.  The mechanisms described in this document have been implemented, tested and deployed on the large research IPv6 network in China.</description>
