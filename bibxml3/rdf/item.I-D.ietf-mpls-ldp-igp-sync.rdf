    <description>In certain networks there is a dependency on edge-to-edge Label Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks that are used for MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications. For such applications it is not possible to rely on Internet Protocol (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately. Blackholing of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) is operational on a link but LDP is not operational on that link. While the link could still be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example, MPLS VPN; Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route free core; or IP address carried in the packet is out of the RFC 1918 [RFC 1918] space. This document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.</description>
