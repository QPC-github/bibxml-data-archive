    <title>"Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points", Michelle Cotton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rfc4020bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a process for early allocation of code points by IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC Required", "IETF Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply.  This process can be used to alleviate the problem where code point allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation and deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC that would normally trigger code point allocation.  This document obsoletes RFC 4020.</description>
