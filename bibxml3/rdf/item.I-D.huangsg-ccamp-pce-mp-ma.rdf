    <description>We propose an interaction scheme using Mobile Agent (MA) between the Path Computation Element (PCE) and Management Plane (MP) to solve information collection delay and management message congestion.  It is a new collaboration mechanism about MP in intelligent optical networks.  This mechanism also specifies a flexible communication mode between MP and PCE.</description>
