    <title>"Re-ECN: A Framework for adding Congestion Accountability to TCP/IP", Bob Briscoe, Arnaud Jacquet, Toby Moncaster, Alan Smith</title>

    <description>This document describes the framework to support a new protocol for explicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployed incrementally around unmodified routers.  Re-ECN allows accurate congestion monitoring throughout the network thus enabling the upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork to be held responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to be caused.  So, networks can introduce straightforward accountability for congestion and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end- customers or from neighbouring network domains.  As well as giving the motivation for re-ECN this document also gives examples of mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond correctly to congestion.  And it describes example mechanisms that ensure the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains and end- points will be to use the protocol honestly.</description>
