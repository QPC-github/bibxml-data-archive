    <title>"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules", Steven Legg</title>

    <description>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, and whose values may be transfered in the LDAP protocol, has a defined syntax which constrains the structure and format of its values. The comparison semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided through separately defined matching rules. Matching rules specify an argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax. This document defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes for LDAP directories.</description>
