    <description>Online Social Networking (OSN) applications have attracted millions of people over the last few years. Their traffic represents a large part of the traffic of the Internet. For instance, Facebook represents near 25 percent of the Internet traffic [14][15], and a part of this traffic is exchanged amongst groups of end-users which are located in the same geographic area. In this document, we introduce a Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture to improve the delivery of OSNs contents requested by end-users in the neighbourhood of the publishers: Having the knowledge of the social network graph and the end-users network location, a SDN-based NDN controller dynamically configures the NDN routers to route the interest requests directly between the end-users.</description>
