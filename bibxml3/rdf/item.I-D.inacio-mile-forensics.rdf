    <title>"Digital Forensics Extension for IODEF", Christopher Inacio, Younhee gil</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-inacio-mile-forensics-01.txt</link>
    <description>This extension to IODEF (RFC 5070) is designed to aid in the sharing and dissemination of digital forensics information.  The goal is to allow a tool independent format to share information between organizations focused on digital forensics: drive images, file carving, metadata, and related hashes.  As with IODEF and its extensions, it is defined using XML.</description>
