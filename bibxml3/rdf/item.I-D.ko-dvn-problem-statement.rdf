    <description>This document examines the problems and challenges associated with the process of setting up secure virtual network connections among authorized network nodes.  The network nodes can be located anywhere in a private or public network, directly connected or behind one or more levels of NAT.  Setting up a secure virtual network in this environment entails the resolution of various issues such as authentication, peer discovery, virtual network address management, and connection parameters determination.</description>
