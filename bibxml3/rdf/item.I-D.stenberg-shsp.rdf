    <description>In reasonable home networks there are no cloud services; just a set of local nodes sharing state, and possibly invoking operations either automatically or on behalf of the home user.  This document describes a key-value database that can be used to do both; published key=values represent the current state of the system, and by setting a key published by some other node to a different value a node can indicate the desire for changing of state.</description>
