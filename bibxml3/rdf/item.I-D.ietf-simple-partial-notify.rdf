    <description>By default, presence delivered using the Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is represented in the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF).  A PIDF document contains a set of elements, each representing a different aspect of the presence being reported.  When any subset of the elements change, even just a single element, a new document containing the full set of elements is delivered.  This memo defines an extension allowing delivery of only the presence data that has actually changed.</description>
