    <title>"Prefix Management for Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover on Point-to-Point Links", Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mipshop-fmip-ptp-05.txt</link>
    <description>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not explicitly define prefix management over point-to-point links when a mobile node uses a prefix to formulate a new care-of-address.  In this document a mechanism is developed for a previous access router to request unique prefixes from a new access router, and in turn, the previous access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile node for a new care-of-address configuration.  Extensions to Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification are also specified in this document.</description>
