    <description>This document provides use case studies and network design considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice for the new generation of packet transport. Many service providers (SPs) are working to replace the legacy transport technologies, e.g. SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM technologies, with MPLS-TP for packet transport, in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower operational cost, while maintaining transport characteristics.  The use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro Ethernet access and aggregation, Mobile backhaul, and packet optical transport. The design considerations discussed in this documents ranging from operational experience; standards compliance; technology maturity; end-to-end forwarding and OAM consistency; compatibility with IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor interoperability; and optimization vs. simplicity design trade off discussion. The general design principle is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport solutions.</description>
