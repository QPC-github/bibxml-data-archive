    <description>Hierarchical SFC is a network architecture for implementing SFC the chain with an ordered set of service functions which could be deployed in multiple geographically dispersed networks. How to forward traffic between networks in Hierarchical SFC is what the draft wants to present.  This document proposes a mapping-based forwarding method with coordinated orchestration by the translation of H-SFC and I-SFC to forward traffic between networks in Hierarchical SFC.</description>
