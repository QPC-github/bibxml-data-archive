    <title>"Raptor Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes for Objects", Michael Luby, M.  Amin Shokrollahi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-luby-rmt-bb-fec-raptor-object-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the Raptor code and its application to reliable delivery of objects. Two Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are introduced, one for a non-systematic version of Raptor and one for a systematic version of Raptor, that supplements the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452. Raptor is a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from the source symbols of a source block. The decoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols only slightly more in number than the number of source symbols.</description>
