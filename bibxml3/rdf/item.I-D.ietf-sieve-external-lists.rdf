    <title>"Sieve Extension: Externally Stored Lists", Alexey Melnikov, Barry Leiba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sieve-external-lists-10.txt</link>
    <description>The Sieve email filtering language can be used to implement email whitelisting, blacklisting, personal distribution lists, and other sorts of list matching.  Currently, this requires that all members of such lists be hardcoded in the script itself.  Whenever a member of a list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded to a mail server.  This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally stored lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the script, such as using LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244), CardDAV (work in progress), or relational databases.</description>
