    <title>"Basic iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)  Scheduling Events", Doug Royer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-royer-itip-basic-00.txt</link>
    <description>This is the second release of iTIP. After having learned from RFC-2446 where most of this text comes from. This document represents the common objects needed for basic calendaring. The VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE, recurrence rules (RDATE remains), and scheduling and their associated properties have been removed. These removals are expected to appear in new memos at a later time and will be independent extensions of this specification. The new EXTENSIONS property will exist to allow for compatible sets of extensions.</description>
