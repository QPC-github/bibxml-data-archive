    <description>As defined in [RFC5654] MPLS-TP transport path includes LSP and PW. And the possibility of transferring the ownership and control of an existing and in-use path between the management plane and the control plane, without actually affecting data plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option for carrier.  [RFC5493] and [RFC5852] describe the LSP transfer.  This memo gives the requirement and LDP extensions for PW transfer in an MPLS-TP network.</description>
