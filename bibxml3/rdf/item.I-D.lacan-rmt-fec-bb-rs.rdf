    <description>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme for the Reed- Solomon forward error correction code and its application to reliable delivery of data objects on the packet erasure channel. The Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, i.e, they enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set of k received symbols. The implementation described here is compatible with the IPR-free implementation described in [5].</description>
