    <description>A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets containing non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source that should be passed across the translator as an ICMP packet directed to the the IPv4-translatable destination.  This document discusses the considerations and the stateless address mapping algorithms for source address translation in ICMPv6 headers for such cases.</description>
