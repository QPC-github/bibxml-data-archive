        <description>Along as the popularization and adoption of IP in emerging scenarios, challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure.  To enable TCP/IP in networks that previously using exclusive protocol, a flexible address structure would be far more preferred for their particular properties [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure].  This document describes a flexible address structure -- Flexible IP (FlexIP) acting on limited domains [RFC8799].  FlexIP is expected to proactively adapt scenarios under flexible address structure. Meanwhile, FlexIP still benefit from global reachability based on the IPv6 interoperability.</description>
