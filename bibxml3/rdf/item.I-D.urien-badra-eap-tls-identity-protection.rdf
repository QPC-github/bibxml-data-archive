    <title>"Identity Protection within EAP-TLS", Pascal Urien, Mohamad Badra</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-urien-badra-eap-tls-identity-protection-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a mechanism that ensures EAP-TLS identity protection. The main idea is to encrypt the client's certificate. Three procedures are proposed in order to determine the certificate encryption mechanism, - Implicit, the client's certificate is encrypted according to a pre-defined algorithm, deduced from the server's certificate. - Notified, the EAP-identity response message, delivered by the client includes information that precise the encryption algorithm to be used. - Negotiated, the client indicates a list of encryption algorithm, the server chooses one of them, and indicates its choice.</description>
