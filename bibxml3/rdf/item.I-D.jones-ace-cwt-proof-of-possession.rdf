    <description>This specification describes how to declare in a CBOR Web Token (CWT) that the presenter of the CWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key.  Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.  This specification provides equivalent functionality to "Proof-of- Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)" (RFC 7800), but using CBOR and CWTs rather than JSON and JWTs.</description>
