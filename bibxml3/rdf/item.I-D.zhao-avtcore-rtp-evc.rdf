    <title>"RTP Payload Format for Essential Video Coding (EVC)", Shuai Zhao, Stephan Wenger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhao-avtcore-rtp-evc-02.pdf</link>
    <description>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [ISO23094-1], also known as Essential Video Coding [EVC] and developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other applications.</description>
