    <description>This memo describes the registration of the Short Message Service (SMS) as a registered IANA service selector for Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) numbers. SMS is not available for all GSTN subscribers, but it has proven very popular with users of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and has also been adapted to other telephone network technologies such as the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).</description>
