    <title>"Use of DNS to Carry Configuration Metadata Concerning Automatic Replication of Zones", Paul Vixie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vixie-dnsext-dnsshadow-00.txt</link>
    <description>Whenever it is desireable to exactly replicated the content of a DNS zone into one or more other DNS zones so that the content is reachable by multiple names at different zone apexes, it is likewise desireable that this behaviour be automated so that cooperating primary and secondary nameservers can generate and serve the entire set of shadows without human intervention and in an open multivendor manner.  This document describes a new CLONE resource record for a zone apex which can guide such cooperation.</description>
