    <description>Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS) is defined as a Layer 2 VPN service.  It provides point-to-multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer 2 technologies, including Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet, PPP, etc, across an IP or MPLS-enabled IP Packet Switch Network (PSN).  It is often required for redundant access between two VPMS PEs to which a CE is attached, called "dual-homed".  This document describes how dual-homed access can be achieved in the context of BGP-based VPMS.</description>
