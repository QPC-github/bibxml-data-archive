    <title>"Multi-topology routing in OSPFv3 (MT-OSPFv3)", Sina Mirtorabi, Abhay Roy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extensible mechanism to support multiple topologies (MT) in OSPFv3. These topologies can be used within the same address family in order to compute different paths for different classes of service, or belong to different address families allowing an integrated definition of address family with OSPFv3. The extension described in this document can further facilitate any future extensions of OSPFv3.</description>
