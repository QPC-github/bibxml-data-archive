    <title>"Problem Statement and Requirements on a 3-Party Key Distribution Protocol  for Handover Keying", Yoshihiro Ohba</title>

    <description>The HOKEY WG is developing solutions for optimizations as well as security key hierarchy specifications for handovers. The key derivation specifications all draw from a trust relationship that is created as a result of a "2-party" EAP authentication between a peer and a backend server, while distributing the resulting keys to third parties other than the peer and the backend server. This document describes problem statement and requirements on a three-party key distribution protocol for handover keyings.</description>
