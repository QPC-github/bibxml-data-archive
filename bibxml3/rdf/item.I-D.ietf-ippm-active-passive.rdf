    <title>"Active and Passive Metrics and Methods (and everything in-between, or Hybrid)", Al Morton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ippm-active-passive-06.txt</link>
    <description>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as Active or Passive.  Some methods may use a subset of both active and passive attributes, and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods.  This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</description>
