        <description>This document defines a TLS extension that enables a server to prove to a client that it has knowledge of the public key of a key pair where the client has knowledge of the private key of the key pair. Unlike standard TLS key exchanges, the public key is never exchanged in TLS protocol messages.  Proof of knowledge of the public key is used by the client to bootstrap trust in the server.  The use case outlined in this document is to establish trust in an EAP server.</description>
