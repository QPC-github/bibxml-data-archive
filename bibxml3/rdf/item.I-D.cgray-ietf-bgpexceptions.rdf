    <title>"An Exceptions Capability for Distributed Null-Routing in BGP", C. Gray, Sa'ad Mansoor</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cgray-ietf-bgpexceptions-00.txt</link>
    <description>There is not currently any standardized method of dealing with distributed or other large scale threats other than individual firewall and/or null routing instructions.  This Internet Draft describes an optional BGP Capability (as defined by RFC 5492) that allowed Autonomous Systems to self-censor utilizing the existing Inter-Domain Routing system.  This capability does not add any automatic actions and must be explicitly activated by an administrator.</description>
