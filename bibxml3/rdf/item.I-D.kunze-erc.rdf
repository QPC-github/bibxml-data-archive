    <description>Kernel metadata is a small prescriptive vocabulary designed to support highly uniform but minimal object descriptions for the purpose of orderly collection management.  The Kernel vocabulary, based on a subset of the Dublin Core (DC) metadata element set, aims to describe objects of any form or category, but its reach is limited to a small number of fundamental questions such as who, what, when, and where.  The Electronic Resource Citation (ERC), also specified in this document, is an object description that addresses those four questions using Kernel and other metadata elements.</description>
