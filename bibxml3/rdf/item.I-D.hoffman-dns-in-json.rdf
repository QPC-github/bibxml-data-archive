    <description>Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages, as data.  For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses might want to be able to easily search those without having to decode the messages each time.  Another example is a system that puts together DNS queries and responses from message parts.  This document describes a general format for DNS message data in JSON.  Specific profiles of this document can be described in other documents for specific applications and usage scenarios.</description>
