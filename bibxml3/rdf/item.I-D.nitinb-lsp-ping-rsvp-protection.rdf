    <description>This document describes methods for performing lsp ping over mpls rsvp-te protection paths, when the protection paths are not in use. Conventional LSP-Ping follows the same path as data traffic.  In some cases, it might be useful to follow the data path of protection paths (detours and bypasses) to ensure that the those paths are fully functional.  This document describes enhancements to LSP-Ping to perform ping over such paths.</description>
