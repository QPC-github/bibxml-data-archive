    <description>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC 2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing. It updates the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC 2330 to include IPv6 packets, deprecates the definition of minimal IP packet, and augments distinguishing aspects of packets, referred to as Type-P for test packets in RFC 2330.  This memo identifies that IPv4-IPv6 co-existence can challenge measurements within the scope of the IPPM Framework.  Example use cases include, but are not limited to IPv4-IPv6 translation, NAT, or protocol encapsulation.  IPv6 header compression and use of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Area Networks (6LoWPAN) are considered and excluded from the standard-formed packet evaluation.</description>
