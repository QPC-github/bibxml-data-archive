    <title>"GMPLS RSVP-TE Extensions for SONET/SDH and OTN OAM Configuration", Andras Kern, Attila Takacs</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kern-ccamp-rsvp-te-sdh-otn-oam-ext-02.txt</link>
    <description>GMPLS has been extended to support connection establishment in both SONET/SDH [RFC4606] and OTN [RFC4328] networks.  However support for the configuration of the supervision functions is not specified. Both SONET/SDH and OTN implement supervision functions to qualify the transported signals.  This document defines extensions to RSVP-TE for SONET/SDH and OTN OAM configuration based on the OAM Configuration Framework defined in [GMPLS-OAM-FWK].</description>
