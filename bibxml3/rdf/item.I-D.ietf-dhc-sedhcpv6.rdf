    <description>DHCPv6 includes no deployable security mechanism that can protect end-to-end communication between DHCP clients and servers.  This document describes a mechanism for using public key cryptography to provide such security.  The mechanism provides encryption in all cases, and can be used for authentication based on pre-sharing of authorized certificates.</description>
