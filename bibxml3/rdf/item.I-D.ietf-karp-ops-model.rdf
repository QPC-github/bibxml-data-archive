    <description>The IETF is engaged in an effort to analyze security of routing protocol authentication according to design guidelines discussed in RFC 6518.  Developing an operational and management model for routing protocol security that works with all the routing protocols will be critical to the deployability of these efforts.  This document gives recommendations to operators and implementors regarding management and operation of router authentication.  These recommendations will also assist protocol designers in understanding management issues they will face.</description>
