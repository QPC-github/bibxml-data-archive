    <description>This document presents the concepts and the implementations of address-sharing dual-stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation (dIVI).  The dIVI is an extension of 1:1 stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with features of IPv4 address sharing and dual translation.  The major benefits of those extensions are using public IPv4 addresses more effectively and removing the requirements of DNS64 and ALG, without loosing the stateless, end-to-end address transparency and bidirectional-initiated communications.</description>
