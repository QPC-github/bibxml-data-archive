    <description>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment.  However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.  This document defines Negative Trust Anchors which can be used to mitigate DNSSEC validation failures by disabling DNSSEC validation at specified domains.
