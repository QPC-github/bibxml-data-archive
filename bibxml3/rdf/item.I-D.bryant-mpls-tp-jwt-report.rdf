    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bryant-mpls-tp-jwt-report-00.pdf</link>
    <description>This RFC archives the report of the IETF - ITU-T Joint Working Team (JWT) on the application of MPLS to Transport Networks.  The JWT recommended of Option 1: The IETF and the ITU-T jointly agree to work together and bring transport requirements into the IETF and extend IETF MPLS forwarding, OAM, survivability, network management and control plane protocols to meet those requirements through the IETF Standards Process.  There are two versions of this RFC.  An ASCII version that contains a summary of the slides and a PDF version that contains the summary and a copy of the slides.</description>
