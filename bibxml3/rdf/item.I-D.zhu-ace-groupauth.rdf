    <description>The group communication is designed for the communication of Internet of Things. A threat is identified in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm] that current DTLS based approach is unicast oriented and there is no supporting on group authentication feature. Unicast oriented authentication will causing serious burden when a large number of terminal nodes will be involved inevitably. In another aspect, some terminals will own the same characteristics, such as owning same features, in the same place, working in the same time, etc. With this mechanism, all terminals can be authenticated together with little signaling and calculation at the same time. It will reduce the network burden and save time. This draft describes the security of group authentication and an group authentication implementation method for the Internet of things.</description>
