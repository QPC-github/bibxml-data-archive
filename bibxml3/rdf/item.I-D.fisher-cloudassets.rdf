    <description>There is no standardized method to describe assets used in a cloud such that they can be moved from one cloud to the next independent of the underlying architecture. This document defines Cloud Assets as a lightweight description of cloud resources and proposes a standardization of Cloud Assets into three major categories: Resource Assets, Component Assets, and Composite Assets.</description>
