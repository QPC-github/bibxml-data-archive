    <title>"Data At Rest Encryption Part 2: DARE Container", Phillip Hallam-Baker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hallambaker-dare-container-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes DARE Container, a message and file syntax that allows an append-only sequence of data frames to be represented with cryptographic integrity, signature and encryption enhancements. The format supports data integrity checks using digest chains and Merkle trees.  The simplest supports efficient write operations and efficient read operations in either the forward or reverse direction. Support for efficient random-access reads may be provided through the use of binary trees or index records appended to the end of the file.
