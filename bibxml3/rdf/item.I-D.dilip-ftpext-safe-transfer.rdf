    <title>"Safe GET &amp; Safe PUT options for FTP", Dilip Kumar Nanecha, Chetan  Aswathanarayana</title>

    <description>This draft presents a mechanism to overcome one of the cumbersome aspects of file transfer. Ftp fails to transfer the data as there is not enough disk space on the remote machine, but it fails only after it does the substantial data transfer and discovers that there is no more disk space left on the remote machine. The basic intention is to provide FTP Extension for checking the availability of the disk space before starting the actual file transfer operation on remote machines.</description>
