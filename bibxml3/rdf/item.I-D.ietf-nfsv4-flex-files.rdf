    <title>"Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible File Layout", Benny Halevy, Thomas Haynes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-nfsv4-flex-files-19.txt</link>
    <description>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.  The flexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS which allows the use of storage devices in a fashion such that they require only a quite limited degree of interaction with the metadata server, using already existing protocols.  Client-side mirroring is also added to provide replication of files.</description>
