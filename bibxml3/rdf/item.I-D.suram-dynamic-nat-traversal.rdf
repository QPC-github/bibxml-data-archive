    <description>NAT can be enabled on a Security Gateway by administrator at any point of time.  This can be called as Dynamic NAT.  The existing IKEv2 RFC does not address the scenario of NAT being enabled on a security gateway after IKEv2 negotiation.  In such a scenario, traffic sent over the IPsec SA will either be dropped or does not reach the peer security gateway.  This document defines a method to ensure that IPsec traffic flow seamlessly in such a scenario.</description>
