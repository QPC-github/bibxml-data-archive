    <title>"Requirements for the Support of Continuously Varying Values in Presence", Martin Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-simple-cont-presence-val-req-02.txt</link>
    <description>The attributes of continuous-valued data are examined in respect to presence systems.  The limitations of the existing presence system with respect to continuous-valued data is examined.  Requirements are formulated that would enable the use of the presence system for this data, with an emphasis on providing the watcher with a means of control over the measurement process.</description>
