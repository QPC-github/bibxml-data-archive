    <title>"OAuth 2.0 DPoP for the Implicit Flow", Michael Jones, Brian Campbell, John Bradley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jones-oauth-dpop-implicit-00.txt</link>
    <description>This specification describes a mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth 2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the application level.  This mechanism allows for the detection of replay attacks with access tokens.  This specification compliments and builds upon the mechanisms defined in draft-fett-oauth-dpop, in which access tokens are returned from the token endpoint.  In particular, this specification extends the Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) mechanisms to also be usable with the OAuth 2.0 implicit flow, in which access tokens are returned from the authorization endpoint.</description>
