    <title>"Security Bootstrapping over IEEE 802.15.4 in selective order", Sandeep Kumar, Peter Van der Stok</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kumar-6lo-selective-bootstrap-00.txt</link>
    <description>Low-resource devices in a Low-resource and Lossy Network (LLN) can be based on a mesh network using the IEEE 802.15.4 link standard. Security in these networks MUST be enforced at the link level. Provisioning the devices in a secure manner with keys (often called security bootstrapping) to encrypt and authenticate the link-layer messages is the subject of this specification.  This proposal distinguishes itself from other bootstrap proposals by requiring that the devices can be secured in an order determined by the needs of the installation procedure.  Other proposals use an "onion model", where first the devices one-hop away from the initial device (often the border router) are secured, followed by the devices that are one-hop away from already secured devices.</description>
