    <description>This document specifies an event package for content push delivery protocol over SIP.  The purpose is to allow an application on a UA to subscribe to updates to its own application events containing either content or references to the content.  This document describes how content can be pushed out to an application by the use of push events.  A new SIP event package is defined for notification of push events for content delivery.</description>
