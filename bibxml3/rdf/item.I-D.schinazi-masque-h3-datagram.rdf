    <title>"Using QUIC Datagrams with HTTP/3", David Schinazi, Lucas Pardue</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schinazi-masque-h3-datagram-04.txt</link>
    <description>The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging the security and congestion-control properties of QUIC.  However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex application contexts.  This document defines how to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is HTTP/3 by adding an identifier at the start of the frame payload.  This allows HTTP messages to convey related information using unreliable DATAGRAM frames, ensuring those frames are properly associated with an HTTP message.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing list (masque@ietf.org (mailto:masque@ietf.org)) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft-h3-datagram.</description>
