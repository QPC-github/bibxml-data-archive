    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wendt-sipcore-callinfo-rcd-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a SIP Call-Info header field usage defined to include rich data associated with the identity of the calling party that can be rendered to called party for providing more useful information about the caller or the specific reason for the call. This includes extended comprehensive information about the caller such as what a jCard object can represent for describing the calling party or other call specific information such as describing the reason or intent of the call.  The elements defined for this purpose are intended to be extensible to accommodate related information about calls that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone and additionally, with the use of jCard and other elements, to be compatible with the STIR/PASSporT Rich Call Data framework.</description>
