    <description>There is no standard, interoperable method for associating Internet service identifiers with payment information.  This document specifies a means for retrieving information sufficient for a party to render payment using various payment networks given the recipient's email address by leveraging the DNS to securely publish payment information in a payment association record.  A payment association record associates an Internet service identifier such as an email address with payment information such as an account number or Bitcoin address.</description>
