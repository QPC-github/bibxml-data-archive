    <description>The IETF requires English for technical discussion in working groups, in working group documents and in anything considered for publication.  Use of English simplifies overhead and makes for clear discussion of a single document in a single language, but disadvantages those who lack fluency and comfort in English.  This document proposes setting up talk mailing lists for languages other than English, where technical matters can be discussed in comfort, and perhaps even be written up in internet-draft form in a language other than English.  Once technical ideas are in place, a draft can move forward to a working group in English.  Exposing non-English speakers to the IETF will, in the interests of diversity, allow them to gain familiarity with IETF processes while discussing with other fluent speakers of their language.  This benefits the IETF by attracting a broader constituency while meeting its diversity goals.</description>
