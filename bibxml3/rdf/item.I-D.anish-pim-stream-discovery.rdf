    <title>"PIM source discovery in Last-Hop-Router", Anish Peter, Robert Kebler, Vikram Nagarajan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-anish-pim-stream-discovery-01.txt</link>
    <description>This specification introduces a mechanism in PIM-SM [RFC4601] for the Last-Hop-Router (LHR) router to discover the stream information. Once this mechanism is available the complications of the shared tree procedures can be avoided.  The document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for the information about multicast streams active in the network.  This specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms defined by PIM Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559].  This is simply a means to transmit reliable PIM messages and does not require the support for Join/Prune messages over PORT as defined in [RFC6559].</description>
