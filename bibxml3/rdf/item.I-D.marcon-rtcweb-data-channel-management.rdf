    <description>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP.  How to transport application messages on these data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they can be carried as SCTP user messages), however it is yet to be decided how to establish and manage these data channels.  This document specifies a method for this, which relies first on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band negotiation of data channel configurations (within the SDP offer/ answer exchange) and second on the signaling of the configuration in use in the SCTP user message itself.  Once these configurations are negotiated, further creations of data channels can occur purely in- band by simply sending user messages, which avoids to define a new in-band data channel protocol.</description>
