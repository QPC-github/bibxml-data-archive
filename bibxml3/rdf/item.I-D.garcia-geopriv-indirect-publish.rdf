    <title>"Indirect Presence Publication with the Session Initiation Protocol(SIP)", Miguel Garcia, Hannes Tschofenig, Henning Schulzrinne, Martin Thomson</title>

    <description>A method for indirectly publishing presence information is described. This allows a presentity user agent to publish a URI that can be used by the presence agent to retrieve presence information.  A presence agent is then better able to acquire dynamic presence information without relying on the presentity user agent.  This also allows a presentity user agent to delegate responsibility for managing changing presence data to the source of that information.</description>
