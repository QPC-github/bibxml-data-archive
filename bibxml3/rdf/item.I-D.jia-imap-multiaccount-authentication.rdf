    <description>Simultaneous authentication for multiple accounts is an attractive feature but is not supported in the current Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501]. This document introduces an extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With this extension, when a client is authenticated with one of its account identifiers, it is also authenticated automatically with all the other associated account identifiers (if present), i.e., a client can be authenticated for all of its associated accounts at the same time.</description>
