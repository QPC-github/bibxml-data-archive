        <title>"Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol", David Noveck</title>
        <dc:date>2021-11-25T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and was, until recently, documented as a completely separate protocol.  This document will give rise to a suite of documents which collectively obsolete RFC 8881.  In addition to many corrections and clarifications, it will rely on NFSv4-wide documents to substantially revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization, and security, superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the protocol appearing in RFCs 5661 and 8881.</description>
