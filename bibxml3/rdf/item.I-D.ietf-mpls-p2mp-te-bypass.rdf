    <title>"P2MP MPLS-TE Fast Reroute with P2MP Bypass Tunnels", Jean-Louis Le Roux</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mpls-p2mp-te-bypass-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE-LSP) in  MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, based upon Point-To-MultiPoint Bypass Tunnels. The motivation for using P2MP Bypass Tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive data duplication along the backup path that could occur if Point-To-Point Bypass Tunnels were used, i.e., to optimize the bandwidth usage, during fast reroute protection of a link or a node. During link or node failure the traffic carried onto a protected P2MP TE-LSP is tunnelled within one or several P2MP Bypass Tunnels towards a set of Merge Points. To avoid data duplication, backup labels (i.e., inner labels) are assigned by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) according to the RSVP-TE upstream label assignment procedure.</description>
