    <description>This draft states the problem of the current generalized multi- protocol label switching (GMPLS) routing in order to deal with inter- domain TE links for GMPLS inter-domain signaling. Since the GMPLS signaling protocol introduces bi-directional label switched path (LSP) creation mechanism, an ingress node (or a path computation element) searches for the bidirectional route in the traffic engineering database (TED). Considering the GMPLS inter-domain path creation, the TED contains only outgoing TE information of inter- domain links and will not be able to confirm the validity of the incoming inter-domain links.  In order to solve this issue, we describe the GMPLS inter-domain routing requirement in support of exchanging of inter-domain TE link information.</description>
