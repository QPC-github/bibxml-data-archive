    <title>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP", Francois Audet, Cullen  Jennings</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-behave-nat-udp-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types of NAT behavior when handling Unicast UDP and also defines a set of requirements that would allow many applications, such as multimedia communications or on-line gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that these applications will function properly.</description>
