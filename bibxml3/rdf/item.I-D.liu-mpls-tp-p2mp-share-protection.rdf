    <description>according to protection Requirements in RFC 5654 and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk WG draft, there are the following requirements : requirement 70 : The restored and protected paths must be able to share resources.another requirment 67B : MPLS-TP must support unidirectional 1:n protection for P2MP ,so this document will describle and provide two share protection solutions to protect and recovery P2MP services. and satisfied and provided unidirectional 1:n and (1:1)^n protection requirement for unidirectional P2MP serivce  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
