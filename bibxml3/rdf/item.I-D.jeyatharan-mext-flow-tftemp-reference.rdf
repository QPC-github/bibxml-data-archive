    <title>"3GPP TFT Reference for Flow Binding", Mohana Jeyatharan, Chan-Wah Ng</title>

    <description>This memo describes a reference to third generation partner ship project (3GPP) defined traffic flow template (TFT) as a traffic selector in the flow based routing mechanism described in the flow binding draft [1].  This memo, further specifies a new traffic selector sub-option format to be used with the flow binding mobility option defined in draft [1], in order to transport the TFT reference from the mobile node to its home agent in a 3GPP SAE (service architecture evolution) scenario.</description>
