    <title>"MIKEY DHHMAC-SAS: The New MIKEY Transportation Mode", Alexandre Barreto, Antonio Faleiros</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barreto-ietf-dhhmac-sas-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a new transport mode to the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKE) protocol, the MIKEY-DHHMAC-SAS.  The MIKEY has as its objective the negotiation of cryptography parameters necessaries to the establishment of a secure (SRTP/SRTCP) end-to-end multimedia channel, but all its operation modes have some kind of limitation that prevents it of being used to this purpose.  The  MIKEY-DHHMAC-SAS solves theses existing limitations in MIKEY-DH and MIKEY-DHHMAC modes by adding the features of key continuity and Short Authentication String (SAS), making possible its use in any end-to- end multimedia scenario.</description>
