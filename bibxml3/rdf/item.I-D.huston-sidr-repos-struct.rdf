    <title>"A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure", Geoff Huston, Robert Loomans, George Michaelson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-huston-sidr-repos-struct-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a profile for the structure of repositories that contain X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed objects.  This profile contains the proposed object naming scheme, the contents of repository publication points, the contents of publication point manifests and a possible internal structure of a Repository Cache that is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed collection of repositories and facilitate certificate path construction.</description>
