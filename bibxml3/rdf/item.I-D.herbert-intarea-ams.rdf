    <description>This document describes the Address Mapping System that is a generic, extensible, and scalable system for mapping network addresses to other network addresses. The Address Mapping System is intended to be used in conjunction with overlay techniques which facilitate transmission of packets across overlay networks. Information returned by the Address Mapping System can include the particular network overlay method to use, as well as instructions related to using the method.  The Address Mapping System has a number of potential use cases including identifier-locator protocols, network virtualization, and promotion of privacy.</description>
