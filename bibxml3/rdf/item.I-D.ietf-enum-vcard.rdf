    <description>This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" using the URI schemes "http" and "https". This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain name to a vCard instance describing the user of the respective E.164 number. Information gathered from those vCards could be used before, during or after inbound or outbound communication takes place. For example, a callee might be presented with the name and association of the caller before picking up the call.</description>
