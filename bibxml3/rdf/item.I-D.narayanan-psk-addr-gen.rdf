    <description>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) provide a means of generating an IP address that is tied to a public key of a node. Using this means, the address ownership of the node can be verified by using the public key of the node to decrypt data signed by the node using its private key. In AAA-based systems, there is currently no means of performing such absolute address ownership checks, since address authorization is traditionally outside the scope of AAA. However, in some key generation protocols, it may be critical to perform address ownership verification or authorization before the generated key can be used. When such key generation protocols are AAA-based, there is no known method of address authorization to allow this operation. This draft provides a means of IPv6 address generation using a shared secret so that the IP address of a node can be verified by the entity with which the node shares the secret.</description>
