    <title>"Addressing Record-Route issues in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Thomas Froment, Christophe Lebel, Ben Bonnaerens</title>

    <description>A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to insert a Record-Route header into initial, dialog creating requests in order to make subsequent, in-dialog requests pass through it. This header contains a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) indicating where and how the subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy.  Like any SIP URI, it can contain SIP or SIPS schemes, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and URI parameters that could influence the routing such as the transport parameter (for example transport=tcp), or a compression indication like "comp=sigcomp". When a proxy has to change some of those parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed proxies, transport protocol switching or IPv4 to IPv6 scenarios...), the question arises on what should be put in Record-Route header(s).  It is not possible to make one header have the characteristics of both interfaces at the same time.  This document aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on this topic; it formally recommends the use of the double Record-Route technique as an alternative to the current RFC3261 text, which describes only a Record-Route rewriting solution.</description>
