    <description>Manufacturer User Descriptions are used by device manufacturers to provide indications to the network as to the intended use of a particular device and with what end points it might communicate.  A URI points to those descriptions.  This memo specifies an X.509 certificate extension to specify that URI in a device certificate to be used with IEEE 802.1AR.</description>
