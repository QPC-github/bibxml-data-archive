    <title>"Fast Congestion Response", Roni Even</title>

    <description>The high link speed (100Gb/s) in Data Centers (DC) are making network transfers complete faster and in fewer RTTs.  The short data bursts requires low latency while longer data transfer require high throughput.  This document describes the current state of flow control and congestion handling in the DC using RoCEv2 and suggests new directions for faster congestion control.</description>
