    <title>"GMPLS Signaling Extension for Bandwidth availability", Hao Long</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-long-ccamp-gmpls-bandwidth-availability-00.txt</link>
    <description>Packet switching network usually contains links formed by non-fiber media, e.g., copper, radio, etc. Some kinds of non-fiber links have non-fixed bandwidth capacity because they are very sensitive to external environment. This document describes an extension for GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a LSP in a PSN network which contains non-fixed bandwidth link by introducing an optional availability field in GMPLS signaling.</description>
