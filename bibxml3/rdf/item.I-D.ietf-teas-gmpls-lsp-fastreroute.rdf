    <description>This document updates the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  These updates allow the coordination of a bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse directions of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these updates enable the re-direction of bidirectional traffic onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data paths in the forward and reverse directions after FRR and avoid RSVP soft-state timeout in control-plane.</description>
