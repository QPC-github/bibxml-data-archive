    <title>"Suggested process changes for handling new SIP headers and SIP responses", Keith Drage</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-drage-rai-sip-header-process-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 3427 currently defines the process for defining and registering new SIP header fields.  This document proposes that prefixs to header field names should be discontinued, and that an additional category of experimental header field should be created.  This document also relaxes the requirement that response codes are defined by standards track RFCs, also allowing them to be defined by experimental RFCs.</description>
