    <title>"Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)", Marc Petit-Huguenin, Gonzalo Salgueiro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-petithuguenin-tram-turn-dtls-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] as a transport protocol between a Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] client and a TURN server. It also specifies modifications to the TURN URIs [RFC7065] and to the TURN resolution mechanism [RFC5928] to facilitate the resolution of TURN URIs into the IP address and port of TURN servers supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.</description>
