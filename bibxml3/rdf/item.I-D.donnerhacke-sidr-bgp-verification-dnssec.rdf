    <title>"DNSSEC protected routing announcements for BGP", Lutz Donnerhacke, Wouter  Wijngaards</title>

    <description>This document describes an infrastructure for real time verification of routes reveived via BGP4.  Some DNS query types are introduced to check the origin of a prefix and validity of the AS path. The crypto part can be offloaded from the routing engine by sending a DNS query and checking the AD bit in the DNS response. The proposal depends on the DNS scalability and caching mechanisms as well as PKI introduced by DNSSEC.</description>
