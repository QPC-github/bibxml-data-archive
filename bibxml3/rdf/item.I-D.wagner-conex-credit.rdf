    <description>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow.  In order to make ConEx information useful, reliable auditing is necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx information honestly.  However, there is always a delay between congestion events and the respective ConEx signal at the audit.  To avoid state and complex Round-Trip Time estimations at the audit, in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech] it is proposed to use credit signals sent in advance to cover potential congestion in the next feedback delay duration.  Unfortunately, introducing credit does not provide incentives to honestly report congestion.  This document lists potential issues regarding the proposed crediting and discusses potential solutions approaches to interpret and handle credits at the audit.</description>
