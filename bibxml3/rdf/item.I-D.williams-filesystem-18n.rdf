    <title>"Internationalization Considerations for Filesystems and Filesystem Protocols", Nico Williams</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-williams-filesystem-18n-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes requirements for internationalization (I18N) of filesystems specifically in the context of Internet protocols, the architecture for filesystems in most currently popular general purpose operating systems, and their implications for filesystem I18N.  From the I18N requirements for filesystems and the architecture of running code we derive requirements and recommendations for implementors of operating systems and/or filesystems, as well as for Internet remote filesystem protocols.</description>
