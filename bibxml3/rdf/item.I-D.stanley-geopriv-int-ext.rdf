    <description>This document extends the definition of Interior Location defined in draft-rosen-geopriv-pidf-interior to include a set of registered elements that allow for the expression of relative location.  The expression of relative location enables LAN technologies that have such capability to provide a more accurate location description than normally allowed using [RFC4776] [RFC5139].  By registering the elements described here, interoperability between applications and vendors is enabled.</description>
