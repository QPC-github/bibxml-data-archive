    <description>Open Shortest Path First stub neighbor is an enhancement to the protocol to support large scale of neighbors in some topologies with improved convergence behavior.  It introduces limited changes protocol behavior to implement a scalable solution for hub and spoke topologies by limiting the functionality changes to the hub.  The concepts are also applicable to a host running in a virtual machine environment.</description>
