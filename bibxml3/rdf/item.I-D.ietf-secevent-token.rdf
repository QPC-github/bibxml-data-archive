    <title>"Security Event Token (SET)", Phil Hunt, Michael Jones, William Denniss, Morteza Ansari</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secevent-token-13.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure.  A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject.  These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject.  This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events.  A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.</description>
