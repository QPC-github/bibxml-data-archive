    <title>"IPv6 Minimum Path MTU Hop-by-Hop Option", Robert Hinden, Gorry Fairhurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hinden-6man-mtu-option-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is used to record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source to a destination host.  This collects a minimum recorded MTU along the path to the destination.  The value can then be communicated back to the source using the return Path MTU field in the option.  This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be used in environments like Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow them to better take advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU.</description>
