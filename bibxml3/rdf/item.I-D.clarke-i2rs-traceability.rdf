    <title>"Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) Traceability: Framework and Information Model", Joe Clarke, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Carlos Pignataro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-clarke-i2rs-traceability-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a framework for traceability in the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) and information model for that framework.  It specifies the motivation, requirements, use cases, and defines an information model for recording interactions between elements implementing the I2RS protocol.  This framework provides a consistent tracing interface for components implementing the I2RS architecture to record what was done, by which component, and when. It aims to improve the management of I2RS implementations, and can be used for troubleshooting, auditing, forensics, and accounting purposes.</description>
