    <description>This document defines BGP extensions and procedures that allows use of BFD for Multi Point Networks for fast detection and failover for upstream faults in Multicast VPNs.  The upstream failures addressed in this proposal can be failure of any node between the Root PE and Leaf PE or failure between the Multicast Source and Root PE.</description>
