    <title>"SIIT-DC: Dual Translation Mode", tore</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-anderson-v6ops-siit-dc-2xlat-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension of the SIIT-DC [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc] architecture, which allows applications that are incompatible with IPv6, SIIT-DC and/or Network Address Translation in general to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC environment.  This is accomplished by introducing a new component called a SIIT-DC Host Agent, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Gateway.  The application is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity.  The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc].</description>
