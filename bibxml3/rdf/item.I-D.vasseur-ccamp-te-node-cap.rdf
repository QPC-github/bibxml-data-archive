    <title>"Routing extensions for discovery of Traffic Engineering Node Capabilities", JP Vasseur, Jean-Louis Le Roux</title>

    <description>It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic Engineering (TE) node capabilities during TE LSP path selection, such as for instance the capability to act as a branch LSR of a P2MP LSP. This requires advertising these capabilities within the IGP. For that purpose, this document specifies OSPF and IS-IS traffic engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.</description>
