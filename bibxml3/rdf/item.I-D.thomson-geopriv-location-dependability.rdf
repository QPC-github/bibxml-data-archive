    <title>"Digital Signature Methods for Location Dependability", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom</title>

    <description>The dependability of location information is closely related to the degree of trust placed in the source of that information.  This document describes techniques that can be used to mitigate the impact of falsifying location information.  The application of digital signatures is described, relating these methods to the attacks that they address.</description>
