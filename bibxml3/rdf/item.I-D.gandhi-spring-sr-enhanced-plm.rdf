        <description>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedures for Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring of end-to-end SR paths including SR Policies for both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes, those reduce the deployment and operational complexities in a network.</description>
