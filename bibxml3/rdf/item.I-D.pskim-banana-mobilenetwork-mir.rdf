    <title>"A Bandwidth Aggregation Scheme on Mobile Network with Multi-Interfaced Router", Pyung-Soo Kim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pskim-banana-mobilenetwork-mir-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth aggregation on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced router (MIR). In the proposed scheme, the MIR with multiple heterogeneous wireless network interfaces effectively and fairly distributes packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple network interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a distribution counter associated with corresponding end-to-end path. This distribution counter varied by both weighted capacity and distributed packets is used to determine if a network interface has enough credits to distribute incoming packets on corresponding end-to-end path. As a useful design parameter, the capacity unit can be shown to make the performance of the proposed scheme as good as possible.</description>
