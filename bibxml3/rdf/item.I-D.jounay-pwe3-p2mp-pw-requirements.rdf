    <title>"Requirements for Point-to-Multipoint Pseudowire", Frederic JOUNAY</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jounay-pwe3-p2mp-pw-requirements-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a set of requirements for providing an unidirectional Point-to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge) emulation. The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of a Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the support of multicast services as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network working group.</description>
