    <title>"The IMAP SEARCH=INTHREAD and THREAD=REFS Extensions", Arnt Gulbrandsen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gulbrandsen-imap-inthread-05.txt</link>
    <description>The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to operate on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands which search are implicitly extended.  The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading algorithm using (almost) only the References header field for use with the IMAP THREAD command.</description>
