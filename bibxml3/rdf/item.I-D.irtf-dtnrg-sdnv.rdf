    <title>"Using Self-Delimiting Numeric Values in Protocols", Wesley Eddy, Elwyn Davies</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-dtnrg-sdnv-09.txt</link>
    <description>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bit-string with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy, and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.</description>
