    <description>The NEAT System provides an example of a system designed to implement the TAPS Transport Services.  This document presents the transport services that the NEAT User API provides to an application or upper- layer protocol.  It also describes primitives needed to interface to the NEAT Policy Manager and how policies can be adjusted to match the API behaviour to the properties required by an application or upper- layer protocol using the NEAT User API.</description>
