        <title>"Path Computation Element (PCE) Protocol Extensions for Stateful PCE Usage in GMPLS-controlled Networks", Young Lee, Haomian Zheng, Oscar de Dios, Victor Lopez, Zafar Ali</title>

        <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks. The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) has been extended to support stateful PCE functions where the PCE retains information about the paths already present in the network, but those extensions are technology-agnostic. This memo provides extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS-controlled networks.</description>
