    <description>This draft suggests a name space and system for the locator/ identifier split Internet architecture. The suggested name system considers a host-centric for the current stage as well as an object-centric for the next stage. Firstly, a name space for various communication objects is defined. To consider scalability and distributed architecture, the format of the name space consists of object category, local name, domain name, and parameters. Secondly, registries and servers are introduced to manage mapping between identifier and object names with one-to-many relationship. Then, name registration and resolution using these registries and servers are described.</description>
