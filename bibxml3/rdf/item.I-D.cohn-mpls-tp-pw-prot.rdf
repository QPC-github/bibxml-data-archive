    <title>"MPLS-TP Linear Protection Applicability to MS-PW", Daniel Cohn</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cohn-mpls-tp-pw-prot-00.txt</link>
    <description>One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC 5654] is to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both LSPs and PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk] is applicable to both LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not explicitly describe mechanisms for PW protection in MPLS-TP.  This document extends the applicability of the linear protection mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented PWs (MS-PWs) as defined in [RFC 6073].</description>
