    <description>This specification defines simple extensions to PIM to support Tunnel based Multicast Fast Reroute (TMFRR) utilizing different tunnel technologies.  This mechanism allows protection of native IP multicast traffic against link or node failures, with minimal traffic interruption, compared with situations relying on unicast and multicast route convergence.  The repair for link or node failure happens locally near the point of failure.  This version of specification addresses PIM-SM and SSM traffic protection.</description>
