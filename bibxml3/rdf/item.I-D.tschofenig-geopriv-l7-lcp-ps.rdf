    <description>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and captures discussions for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (LCP). This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network. The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes. For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to convey location within SIP to other entities.</description>
