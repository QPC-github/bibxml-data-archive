    <description>The FMIPv6 specification [1] allows mobile node sending packet using previous Care of Address (PCoA) at a new subnet. But such packets are ignored at home agent or correspondent node because the Binding Cache doesn't contain the PCoA anymore. To avoid this problem, we propose keeping old binding cache for a bit.</description>
