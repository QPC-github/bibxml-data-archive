    <title>"Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over 802 networks", Carsten Bormann</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bormann-rohc-over-802-02.txt</link>
    <description>Various proposals have been submitted to the ROHC working group for enabling the use of ROHC [RFC3095] header compression over Ethernet, 802.11 and other 802-based links. Previous proposals generally suffered from a lack of systems perspective on 802 networks.  The present document attempts to supply some systems perspective and provides a rough outline for a solution.  This is a submission to the IETF ROHC WG.  Please direct discussion to its mailing list, rohc@ietf.org  $Revision: 1.9 $</description>
