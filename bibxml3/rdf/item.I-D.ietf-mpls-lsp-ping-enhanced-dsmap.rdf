    <title>"Mechanism for performing LSP-Ping over MPLS tunnels", Nitin Bahadur, Kireeti Kompella, George Swallow</title>

    <description>This document describes methods for performing LSP-Ping (specified in RFC 4379) traceroute over MPLS tunnels and for traceroute of stitched MPLS label-switched-paths (LSPs).  The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 are insufficient to perform traceroute Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC) validation and path discovery for an LSP that goes over other MPLS tunnels or for a stitched LSP.  This document describes enhancements to the downstream-mapping TLV (defined in RFC 4379). These enhancements along with other procedures outlined in this document can be used to trace such LSPs.</description>
