    <description>This document defines a protocol for provisioning session establishment data into Session Data Registries and SIP Service Provider data stores.  The provisioned data is typically used by various network elements for session peering.  This document describes the Session Peering Provisioning Protocol used by clients to provision registries.  The document provides a set of guiding principles for the design of this protocol including extensibility and independent transport definitions, a basic data model that meets some of the requirements discussed in DRINKS, and an XML Schema Document.</description>
