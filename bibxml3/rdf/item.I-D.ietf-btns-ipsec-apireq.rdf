    <description>Given the open nature of the Internet today, application protocols require strong security. IPsec's wire protocols appear to meet the requirements of many protocols. The lack of a common model for application-layer interfaces has complicated use of IPsec by upper- layer protocols. This document provides an overview of facilities which a host IPsec implementation should provide to applications to allow them to both observe and influence how IPsec protects their communications.</description>
