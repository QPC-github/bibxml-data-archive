    <title>"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework", Dick Hardt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-31.pdf</link>
    <description>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.</description>
