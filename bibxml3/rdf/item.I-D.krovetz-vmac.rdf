    <title>"VMAC: Message Authentication Code using Universal Hashing", Wei Dai, Ted  Krovetz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-krovetz-vmac-01.txt</link>
    <description>This specification describes how to generate an authentication tag using the VMAC message authentication algorithm. VMAC is designed to have exceptional performance in software on 64-bit CPU architectures while still performing well on 32-bit architectures. Measured speeds are as fast as one-half CPU cycle per byte (cpb) on 64-bit architectures, under five cpb on desktop 32-bit processors, and around ten cpb on embedded 32-bit architectures.</description>
