    <description>This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation enables more efficient use of network resources and reduced perception of latency by allowing header field compression and multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.  This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the HTTP/1.1 message format or protocol.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.  This version of the draft has been marked for implementation. Interoperability testing will occur in the HTTP/2.0 interim in Hamburg, DE, starting 2013-08-05.</description>
