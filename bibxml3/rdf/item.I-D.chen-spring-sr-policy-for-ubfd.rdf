        <title>"Segment Routing for Unaffiliated BFD Echo Function", Mach Chen, Cheng Li, Xinjun Chen</title>
        <dc:date>2021-08-02T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR) to ensure that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must reach the remote system before being looped back to the local system.  This enables that U-BFD works not only for one hop scenario but for multiple hops scenario as well.  In addition, this document also defines a way to explicitly specify the loop back path of the U-BFD Echo packets.  This is useful in the case where the forward and reverse path of the Echo packets are required to follow the same path.</description>
