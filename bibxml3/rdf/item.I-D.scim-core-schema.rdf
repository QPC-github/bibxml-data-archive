    <title>"System for Cross-Domain Identity Management: Core Schema 1.1", Chuck Mortimore, Patrick Harding, Paul Madsen, Trey Drake</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-scim-core-schema-01.txt</link>
    <description>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services easier.  The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move identity in to, out of, and around the cloud.  This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model for representing users and groups in JSON and XML formats.  This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers. Additional binding documents provide a standard REST API, SAML binding, and use cases.</description>
