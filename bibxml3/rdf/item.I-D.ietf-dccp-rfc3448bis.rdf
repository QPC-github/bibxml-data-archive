    <title>"TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification", Mark Handley, Sally Floyd, Jitendra Padhye, Joerg Widmer</title>

    <description>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best- effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.  This document obsoletes RFC 3448 and updates RFC 4342.</description>
