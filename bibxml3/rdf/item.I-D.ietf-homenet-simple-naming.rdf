    <title>"Homenet Naming and Service Discovery Architecture", Ted Lemon, Daniel Migault, Stuart Cheshire</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-homenet-simple-naming-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how names are published and resolved on homenets, and how hosts are configured to use these names to discover services on homenets.  It presents the complete architecture, and describes a simple subset of that architecture that can be used in low-cost homenet routers.</description>
