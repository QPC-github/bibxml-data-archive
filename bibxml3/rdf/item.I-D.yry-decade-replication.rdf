    <description>The DECADE Working Group at IETF is working on introducing standard- based, application-agnostic in-network storage for content distribution to improve both network efficiency and application performance.  In this document, we introduce content replication trees and then discuss approaches on how a replication tree can be constructed in DECADE.  In particular, we introduce concepts including core-stateless content pull, and stateful, open content forwarding table.</description>
