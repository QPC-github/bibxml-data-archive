    <description>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such information to applications that need to choose one or more resources from a candidate set.  This document provides motivation for using ALTO in a Virtual Private Network (VPN) environment.  We discuss use cases, requirements, and possible extensions to the base ALTO protocol that will be needed to support VPN services.</description>
