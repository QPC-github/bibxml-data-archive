    <title>"Architectural Framework for Self-Managed Networks with Fault Management Hierarchy", Mehmet Toy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mtoy-anima-self-faultmang-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a self-managed network identifying network problems during failures and repairing them.  Self-managed Network Element (sNE) architectures and Network Management System (sNMS) architectures for centrally and distributedly managed networks are described.  A hierarchy among repairing entities is defined.  An in- band message format for Metro Ethernet networks is proposed for the fault management communication.</description>
