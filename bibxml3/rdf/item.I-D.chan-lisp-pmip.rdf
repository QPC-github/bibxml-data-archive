    <title>"Integrating PMIP into LISP Network", Anthony Chan</title>

    <description>PMIP and LISP are both network-based.  Integration of PMIP with a hierarchical design into the LISP network provides network-based fast-mobility support to enable a mobile node to perform handover in both LISP and non-LISP networks, and non-optimal PMIP routes in the LISP network are avoided.</description>
