    <title>"Re-ECN: Adding Accountability for Causing Congestion to TCP/IP", Bob Briscoe, Arnaud Jacquet, Toby Moncaster, Alan Smith</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-briscoe-tsvwg-re-ecn-tcp-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces a new protocol for explicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployed incrementally around unmodified routers.  The protocol works by arranging an extended ECN field in each packet so that, as it crosses any interface in an internetwork, it will carry a truthful prediction of congestion on the remainder of its path.  The purpose of this document is to specify the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and to give guidelines on any consequent changes required to transport protocols.  It includes the changes required to TCP both as an example and as a specification.  It briefly gives examples of mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond correctly to congestion, but these are described more fully in a companion document.</description>
