    <title>"Routing Loop Issue in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)", Lee Speakman, Kenichi Mase</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-speakman-manet-looping-issue-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the routing loop and packet looping issues in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) running proactive routing protocols using hop count metric.  Mechanisms of loop formation are identified and how the problem of loop formation is exacerbated by the use of Link Layer Notification is described.  The effect of the looping packets on the network are shown by comparing against the case where the looping packets are detected and discarded, showing the need for routing loops or looping packets to be dealt with in MANETs.</description>
