    <title>"An Extension Language for the DNS", John Levine, Paul Vixie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levine-dnsextlang-12.txt</link>
    <description>Adding new RRTYPEs to the DNS has required that DNS servers and provisioning software be upgraded to support each new RRTYPE in Master files.  This document defines a DNS extension language intended to allow most new RRTYPEs to be supported by adding entries to configuration data read by the DNS software, with no software changes needed for each RRTYPE.</description>
