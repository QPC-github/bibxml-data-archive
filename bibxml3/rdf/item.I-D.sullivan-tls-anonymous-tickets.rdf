    <title>"Anonymous Tickets for TLS 1.3", Nick Sullivan, Christopher Wood</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sullivan-tls-anonymous-tickets-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism that enables unlinkable session resumption for TLS 1.3 without server-side state.  In contrast to existing ticket-based resumption in TLS 1.3, wherein servers construct and issue tickets to clients, this document specifies a mechanism by which clients request "anonymous tickets" from servers. When a session is resumed using an anonymous ticket, a server only learns that it previously engaged in a session with some client, rather than linking it to a specific client.  Anonymous tickets are only useful for clients with idempotent early data to send.</description>
