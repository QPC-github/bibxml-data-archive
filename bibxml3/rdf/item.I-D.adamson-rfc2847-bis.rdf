    <title>"Low Infrastructure Public Key Mechanisms: SPKM-3 and LIPKEY", William  Adamson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-adamson-rfc2847-bis-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memorandum describes a method whereby one can use GSS-API [RFC2078] to supply a public-key based secure channel between a client and a server without the need for an external Public Key Infrastructure for certificate verification. The method leverages the existing Simple Public Key Mechanism (SPKM), and is specified as two separate GSS-API mechanisms, SPKM-3 and LIPKEY, with LIPKEY layered above SPKM-3. SPKM-3 describes a method for creation of the secure channel using mutual authentication where both a user and server authenticate with public-key certificates [RFC3280]. SPKM-3 also describes a method for creation of the secure channel where only the server authenticates with a public-key certificate, and the user is anonymous. LIPKEY then uses the SPKM-3 anonymous secure channel to authenticate a user with a password, completing the mutual authentication.</description>
