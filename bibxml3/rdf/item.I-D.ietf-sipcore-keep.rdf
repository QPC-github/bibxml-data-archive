    <title>"Indication of support for keep-alive", Christer Holmberg</title>

    <description>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via header field parameter, "keep", which allows adjacent SIP entities to explicitly negotiate usage of the Network Address Translation (NAT) keep-alive mechanisms defined in SIP Outbound, in cases where SIP Outbound is not supported, cannot be applied, or where usage of keep-alives is not implicitly negotiated as part of the SIP Outbound negotiation.</description>
