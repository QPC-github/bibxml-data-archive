    <title>"Running DNS in Existing QUIC Connections", Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-dns-in-existing-quic-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document has a likely-bad suggestion of how to run DNS service over existing QUIC connections, such as those being used for HTTP for basic web service. The author no longer recommends to do this.</description>
