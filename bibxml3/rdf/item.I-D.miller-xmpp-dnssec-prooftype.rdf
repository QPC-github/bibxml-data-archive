    <title>"Using DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) as a Prooftype for XMPP Domain Name Associations", Matthew Miller, Peter Saint-Andre</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-miller-xmpp-dnssec-prooftype-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely delegating a source domain to a derived domain in XMPP.</description>
