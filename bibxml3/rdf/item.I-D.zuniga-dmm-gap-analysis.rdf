    <description>This document describes practices for the deployment of existing mobility protocols in a distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, and identifies the limitations in the current practices with respect to providing the expected DMM functionality.  The practices description and gap analysis are performed for IP-based mobility protocols, dividing them into three main families: IP client-based, IP network-based, and 3GPP mobility solutions.</description>
