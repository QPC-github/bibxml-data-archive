    <title>"Pre-Midcom Requirements for Traversal of NATs for traffic not supported by  STUN", Rohan Mahy</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mahy-midcom-premidcom-relay-reqs-02.txt</link>
    <description>STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP for NATS) specifies a mechanism which enables nodes in a private network to determine if they are behind a NAT, to discover their remapped address and port, and for many types of NATs to send UDP traffic through them. In addition TCP connections initiated from the private side of NATs already works. This document specifies requirements for a mechanism that enables traversal of expected TCP traffic through all NATs, and traversal of UDP traffic through symmetric NATs.</description>
