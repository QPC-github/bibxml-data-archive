    <title>"The BGP NO_EXPORT_VIA_RS Community for Route Servers", Nick Hilliard, Will Hargrave</title>

    <description>This document describes a BGP Well-known Community called NO_EXPORT_VIA_RS.  This community allows BGP route server clients to instruct an Internet Exchange BGP Route Server to tag prefixes destined for other route server clients with the NO_EXPORT Well-Known Community.  This mechanism allows route server clients to transitively control distribution of their prefixes in other Autonomous Systems connected to the Internet Exchange Route Server.</description>
