    <title>"Planning for Protocol Adoption and Subsequent Transitions", Dave Thaler</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-protocol-transitions-08.txt</link>
    <description>Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol, we have seen a number of transitions throughout the protocol stack, such as deploying a new protocol, or updating or replacing an existing protocol.  Many protocols and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions, and thus some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.  This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions, and also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan.</description>
