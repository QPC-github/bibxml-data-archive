    <title>"M-ISIS: Multi Topology (MT) Routing in IS-IS", Tony Przygienda</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology-12.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an optional mechanism within ISIS used today by many ISPs for IGP routing within their clouds. This document describes how to run within a single ISIS domain a set of independent IP topologies that we call Multi-Topologies (MTs). This MT extension can be used for variety of purposes such as an in-band management network ``on top'' of the original IGP topology, maintain separate IGP routing domains for isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within the backbone, or force a subset of an address space to follow a different topology.</description>
