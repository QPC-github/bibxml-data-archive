    <description>This document presents a gap and solution analysis for end-to-end privacy enabled mapping systems.  Each of the identifier locator separation system has its own approach to mapping identifiers to the locators.  We analyse all these approaches and identify the gaps in each of them and do a solution space analysis in an attempt to identify a mapping system that can be end to end privacy enabled.</description>
