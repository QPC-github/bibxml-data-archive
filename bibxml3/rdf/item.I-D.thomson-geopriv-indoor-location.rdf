    <title>"Locations with Locally-Defined Coordinate Reference Systems for the Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO)", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-geopriv-indoor-location-01.txt</link>
    <description>A method is described for constructing a Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document that contains location information using a locally-defined coordinate reference system (CRS).  This form of representation allows for use of locally-defined coordinates with potential advantages for improved accuracy and usability in local context, in particular location applications that operate indoors.  A framework for defining a local CRS is provided. A process for transformation of coordinates defined in the local CRS and the widely used World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) CRS is defined.</description>
