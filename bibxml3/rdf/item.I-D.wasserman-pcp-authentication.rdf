    <title>"Port Control Protocol (PCP) Authentication Mechanism", Margaret Wasserman, Sam Hartman, Dacheng Zhang</title>

    <description>An IPv4 or IPv6 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to flexibly manage the IP address and port mapping information on Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls, to facilitate communications with remote hosts.  However, the un-controlled generation or deletion of IP address mappings on such network devices may cause security risks and should be avoided.  In some cases the client may need to prove that it is authorized to modify, create or delete PCP mappings.  This document proposes an in-band authentication mechanism for PCP that can be used in those cases. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used to perform authentication between PCP devices.</description>
