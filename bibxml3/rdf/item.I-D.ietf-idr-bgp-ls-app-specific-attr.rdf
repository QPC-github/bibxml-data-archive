        <description>Various link attributes have been defined in link-state routing protocols like OSPF and IS-IS in the context of the MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions have been defined to distribute these attributes along with other topology information from these link-state routing protocols.  Many of these link attributes can be used for applications other than MPLS-TE or GMPLS.  Extensions to link-state routing protocols have been defined for such link attributes that enable distribution of their application- specific values.  This document defines extensions to BGP-LS address- family to enable advertisement of these application-specific attributes as a part of the topology information from the network.</description>
