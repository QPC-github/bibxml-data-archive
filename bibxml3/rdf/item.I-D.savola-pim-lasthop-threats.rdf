    <title>"Last-hop Threats to Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)", James Lingard, Pekka Savola</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-savola-pim-lasthop-threats-02.txt</link>
    <description>An analysis of security threats has been done for some parts of the multicast infrastructure, but the threats specific to the last-hop ("Local Area Network") attacks by hosts on the PIM routing protocol have not been well described in the past. This memo aims to fill that gap.</description>
