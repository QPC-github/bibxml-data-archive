    <description>This document specifies the Interledger Protocol (ILP).  It draws heavily from the definition of the Internet Protocol (IP) defined in [RFC0791].  The interledger protocol is the culmination of more than a decade of research in decentralized payment protocols.  This work was started in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, augmented by the development of Bitcoin in 2008 and has involved numerous contributors since then.  Feedback  This specification is a part of the Interledger Project [1] work. Feedback related to this specification should be sent to public- interledger@w3.org [2].</description>
