    <title>"DHCPv6 Options for IPv4 Residual Deployment (4rd)", Tomasz Mrugalski</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mrugalski-dhc-dhcpv6-4rd-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies DHCPv6 options which are meant to be used by 4rd Customer Edge (CE) to obtain necessary parameters to configure their 4rd automatic tunnels.  The 4rd architecture is defined in [I-D.despres-intarea-4rd].  Since specification of 4rd is still expected to evolve, DHCPv6 options may have to evolve too to fit the revised 4rd specification.</description>
