    <title>"Delegated Distributed Mappings", Sydney Li, Colin Man, Jean-Luc Watson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-watson-dinrg-delmap-02.txt</link>
    <description>Delegated namespaces underpin almost every Internet-scale system - domain name management, IP address allocation, Public Key Infrastructure, etc. - but are centrally managed by entities with unilateral revocation authority and no common interface.  This draft specifies a generalized scheme for delegation that supports explicit time-bound guarantees and limits misuse.  Mappings may be secured by any general purpose distributed consensus protocol that supports voting; clients can query the local state of any number of participants and receive the correct result, barring a compromise at the consensus layer.</description>
