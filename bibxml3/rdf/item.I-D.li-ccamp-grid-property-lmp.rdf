    <description>The recent updated version of ITU-T [G.694.1] has introduced the flexible-grid DWDM technique, which provides a new tool that operators can implement to provide a higher degree of network optimization than is possible with fixed-grid systems.  This document describes the extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) to negotiate link grid property between the adjacent DWDM nodes before the link is brought up.</description>
