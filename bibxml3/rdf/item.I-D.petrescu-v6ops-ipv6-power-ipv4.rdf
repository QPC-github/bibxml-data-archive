    <description>This draft documents preliminary results of measuring the power consumption of using IPv6 vs using IPv4 on typical applications on a smartphone.  The smartphone is connected on a 4G cellular network with either an IPv6 connection, or with an IPv4 connection, but not both simultaneously.  The preliminary results expose a roughly 5% increase in power consumption on IPv6.  More experiments are planned as future work that may confirm or infirm these figures.</description>
