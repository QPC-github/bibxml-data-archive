    <description>This specification defines methods for presentation of a text conversation with focus on the real-time features.  The aim is to give the participants in a conversation a good opportunity to perceive the real-time flow of the conversation and also provide a display of the history of the conversation that makes it easy to read.  Both two-party and multi-party situations are defined.</description>
