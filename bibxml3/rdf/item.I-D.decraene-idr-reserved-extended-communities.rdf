    <title>"Reserved BGP extended communities", Bruno Decraene, Pierre Francois</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-decraene-idr-reserved-extended-communities-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one transitive and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA registries in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive and non-transitive extended communities.  These are similar to the existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community advertissement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non- transitive across ASes.</description>
