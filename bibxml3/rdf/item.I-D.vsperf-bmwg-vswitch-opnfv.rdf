    <title>"Benchmarking Virtual Switches in OPNFV", Maryam Tahhan, Billy O'Mahony, Al Morton</title>

    <description>This memo describes the progress of the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) project on virtual switch performance "VSWITCHPERF".  This project intends to build on the current and completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in IETF, by referencing existing literature.  The Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo begins to describe the additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented in general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the "telco" infrastructure.</description>
