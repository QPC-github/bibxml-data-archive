    <title>"User Defined Errors for RSVP", George Swallow, Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-swallow-rsvp-user-error-spec-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object for communicating errors. That object has a defined format that permits the definition of 256 error codes. As RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in defining new error codes. Further, no provision for user defined errors exists in RSVP. This document defines a new RSVP object to permit user defined error values to be communicated.</description>
