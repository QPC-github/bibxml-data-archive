    <title>"A Scalable IPv4-IPv6 Transition Architecture Need for an  address-port-borrowing-protocol (APBP)", Remi Despres</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-despres-v6ops-apbp-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses, for the IPv4-IPv6 coexistence period, the combined requirement that: (1) legacy IPv4 hosts can establish IPv4 transport connection s from customer sites having IPv6-only permanent addresses; (2) for good scalability, no network address translations (NATs), and a fortiori no application level gateways (ALGs), need to be supported within network infrastructures.  To satisfy this requirement, it is concluded that an address-port-borrowing-protocol (APBP) is needed.</description>
