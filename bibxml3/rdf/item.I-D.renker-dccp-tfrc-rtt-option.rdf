    <title>"Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP", Gerrit Renker, Gorry Fairhurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-renker-dccp-tfrc-rtt-option-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control.  The fix uses a recommendation made in the original TFRC specification.  It avoids the inherent problems of receiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the sender.  It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable extension, upward and downward compatible.</description>
