    <description>Many transport services require that user traffic, in the forms of Pseudowires (PW), to be delivered on a single co-routed bidirectional LSP or two LSPs that share the same routes.  In addition, the user traffic may traverse through multiple transport networks.  This document specifies an optional extension in LDP that enable the binding between PWs and the underlying LSPs.</description>
