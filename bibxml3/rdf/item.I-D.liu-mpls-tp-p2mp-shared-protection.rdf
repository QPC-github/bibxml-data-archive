    <description>This document will describle two protection solutions to support protection of failures in p2mp path in MPLS-TP.  According to the protection Requirements in RFC 5654, there are requirements for MPLS-TP to support sharing of protection resources such that protection paths that are known not to be required concurrently can share the same protection resources.  In addition, there is a requirement for MPLS-TP to support unidirectional 1:n protection for p2mp paths.  These requirements are further addressed in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk . so this draft will present proposed solutions .  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
