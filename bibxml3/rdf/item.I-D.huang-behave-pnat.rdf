    <description>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer's issue, it is not easy to mandate all the applications in the host to change in the first place, the network layer may have to have a solution to support the conventional IPv4 appliations during the IPv6 migration such as in the dual stack or IPv6 only network, especially when multiple applications need to be supported.  This document describes a mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technology which could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility. Applications need not necessarily to understand what the network connection and the destination's IP family type are.  A well-known prefix could be used when the destination is public IPv4 Internet's address.</description>
