    <title>"Key Negotiation Protocol (KNP)", Josh Howlett, Sam Hartman</title>

    <description>The Key Negotiation Protocol enables an untrusting RADIUS client and RADIUS server to derive a key by reference to a mutually trusted actor called the Introducer.  This key may subsequently be used for one of two purposes.  First, it can credential a TLS PSK ciphersuite applied to a RadSec connection between the RADIUS client and RADIUS server; or secondly, to establish a trust relationship between the RADIUS client and a second Introducer that is trusted by the first Introducer.  The composition of these capabilities enables a RADIUS client to establish a RadSec connection with any RADIUS server with whom it shares a direct or indirect trust relationship via one or more Introducers.</description>
