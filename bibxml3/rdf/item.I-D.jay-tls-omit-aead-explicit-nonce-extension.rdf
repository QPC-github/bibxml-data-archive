    <title>"TLS/DTLS Omit AEAD Explicit Nonce from Record Extension", Jayaraghavendran K, Raja K</title>

    <description>With emergence of Internet of Things(IoT), DTLS is being widely considered as a protocol of choice for communication security in IoT applications. Further, AES_CCM has emerged as the cipher of choice in constrained environments. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is the application layer protocol for resource constrained environments, mandates DTLS as underlying security protocol and proposes AES_CCM based ciphers to be used with different key exchange methods. AEAD ciphers requires an explicit nonce of 8 bytes must be carried in each transmitted record.This document defines a TLS (and DTLS) extension, which will allow clients and servers to omit the explicit nonce sent in TLS/DTLS records.  This document can be considered as an extended version of "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions : Extension Definitions". The extension defined in this document apply equally to both DTLS and TLS protocols.</description>
