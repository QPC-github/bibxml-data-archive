    <title>"Report from the IAB Workshop on Routing and Addressing", Dave Meyer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-raws-report-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document reports the outcome of the Routing and Addressing Workshop which the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held on October 18-19, 2006 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The primary goal of the workshop was to develop a shared understanding of the problems that the large backbone operators are facing regarding the scalability of today's Internet routing system. The key workshop findings include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth, constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and not the IAB. Furthermore, note that work on issues related to this workshop report is continuing, and this document does not intend to reflect the increased understanding of issues nor to discuss the range of potential solutions that may be the outcome of this ongoing work.</description>
