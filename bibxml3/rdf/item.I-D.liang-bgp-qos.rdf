    <title>"QoS Enhancements to BGP in Support of Multiple Classes of Service", Lotfi  Benmohamed</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liang-bgp-qos-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the requirements posed on multi-domain Quality of Service (QoS) routing protocols that provide multiple classes of service with multi-dimensional QoS requirements. In particular, it discusses enhancements to Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGPv4) that allow nodes to discover multiple paths with associated QoS attributes. In addition, this documents discusses the details of several new algorithms, such as the dominant path selection algorithm (DPSA).</description>
