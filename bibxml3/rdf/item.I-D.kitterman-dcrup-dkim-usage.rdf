    <title>"Cryptographic Algorithm and Key Usage to DKIM", D. Kitterman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kitterman-dcrup-dkim-usage-00.txt</link>
    <description>The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements included when DKIM was designed in the last decade are functionally obsolete and in need of immediate revision.  This document updates DKIM requirements to those minimaly suitable for operation with currently specified algorithms.  This document updates RFC 6376.</description>
