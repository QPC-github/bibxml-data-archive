    <description>Route Flap Damping (RFD) was first proposed to reduce BGP churn in routers.  Unfortunately, RFD was found to severely penalize sites for being well-connected because topological richness amplifies the number of update messages exchanged.  Many operators have turned RFD off.  Based on experimental measurement, this document recommends adjusting a few RFD algorithmic constants and limits, to reduce the high risks with RFD, with the result being damping a non-trivial amount of long term churn without penalizing well-behaved prefixes' normal convergence process.</description>
