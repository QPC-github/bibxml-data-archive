    <description>CoAP utilizes DNS to discovery the IP address of the CoAP server. However DNS is heavy for the most resource constrained end-points. In this case the assistance from CoAP proxy or research directory (RD) is needed for CoAP transaction.  This specification proposes to define one new dhcp option for proxy/RD discovery for the most resource constrained end-points.</description>
