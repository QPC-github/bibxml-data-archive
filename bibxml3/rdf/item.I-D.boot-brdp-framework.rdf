    <description>This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP) framework.  This framework enables multi-homing for small to medium sites, using Provider Aggregatable IPv6 addresses.  It describes a mechanism for automated IP address configuration and renumbering, a mechanism for optimized source address selection and a new paradigm for packet forwarding.  The BRDP framework prevents ingress filtering problems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing for multi-path transport protocols.  This work also prevents routing scalability problems in the provider network and Internet Default Free Zone because small to medium multi-homed size sites would not need to request Provider Independent address blocks.</description>
