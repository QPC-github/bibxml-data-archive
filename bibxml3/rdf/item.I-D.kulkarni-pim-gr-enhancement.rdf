    <title>"PIM GR Enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and SM", Archana Patel, Janardhan  Kulkarni</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kulkarni-pim-gr-enhancement-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and PIM-SM.  -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh  E-BSR state and to learn RP-Set on Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly.  -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-BIDIR Downstream Routers to  refresh the (*, G) state only after 'Rebooted Upstream Router has  learnt the RP Information and DF election is complete'.  -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream Router to  delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP Information to be learnt on  Rebooted Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism to refresh  the Assert-Winner or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.</description>
