    <title>"OSPFv2 Extensions for Link Capabilities to support U-turn Alternates for  IP/LDP Fast-Reroute", Alia Atlas</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-atlas-ospf-local-protect-cap-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an extension to OSPF Version 2 for advertising link capabilities using the extensions defined for traffic engineering. The link capabilities are defined there for future extensibility. To support the signaling requirements of U-turn alternates for IP Fast-Reroute, this document defines three bits in the proposed link capabilities extension.</description>
