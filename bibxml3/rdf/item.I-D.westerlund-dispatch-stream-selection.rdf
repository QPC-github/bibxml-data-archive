    <title>"Media Stream Selection (MESS)", Daniel Grondal, Bo Burman, Magnus Westerlund</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-westerlund-dispatch-stream-selection-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how media stream selection can be achieved in both a conferencing scenario and peer to peer communication.  To allow endpoints to select specific media streams, all available media in the session must be identifiable and there is a need for messages than can be securely transported between endpoints and network nodes. This document also describes a way to distribute the identification information to all participating endpoints.  The necessary messages can potentially be mapped onto several different encodings, and this document proposes one mapping that uses an extended version of the Binary Floor Control Protocol.</description>
