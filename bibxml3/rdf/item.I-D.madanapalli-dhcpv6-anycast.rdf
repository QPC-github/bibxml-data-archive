    <description>This document introduces a new option in DHCPv6 for Anycast/Shared Unicast Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv6 Client provides. This address assignment is much similar to other address types assignments, except that Anycast Address assignment requires the specification of Service Type of the Anycast or Shared Unicast Address.</description>
