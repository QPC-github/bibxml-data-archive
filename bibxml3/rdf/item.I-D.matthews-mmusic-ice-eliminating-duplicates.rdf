    <title>"Eliminating Duplicate Connectivity Checks in ICE", Eric Cooper, Philip  Matthews</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-matthews-mmusic-ice-eliminating-duplicates-00.txt</link>
    <description>The ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) protocol is designed to find the best possible transmission path between two endpoints in the presence of intervening NAT (Network Address Translation) boxes. It is a very versatile protocol, designed to operate in all possible network topologies. This versatility occasionally results in a large exchange of messages between the two endpoints. This document proposes a modification which reduces the amount of messaging ICE requires, without affecting the effectiveness of ICE. This modification suppresses the transmission of Binding Requests from server-reflexive candidates. The result is increased efficiency due to the suppressed connectivity checks, leading to fewer overall messages and faster discovery of working paths.</description>
