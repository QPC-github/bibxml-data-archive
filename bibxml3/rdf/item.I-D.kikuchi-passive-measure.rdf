    <description>This draft describes a passive measurement method for one-way end-to- end quality.  This method reports both whether a flow of packets is in-sequence or not and error types on detecting out-of-sequence.  The method consumes small resource therefore it can be adapted to many protocols that have sequence number field.</description>
