    <description>Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol information about the underlying network topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.  In other words, information about what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  One of the main use cases of the ALTO Service is its integration with Content Delivery Networks (CDN).  The purpose of this draft is twofold: first, to describe how ALTO can be used in existing and new CDNs, both within an ISP and in separate organizational entities from the ISP; second, to collect requirements for ALTO usage in CDNs and to provide recommendations into the development of the ALTO protocol for better support of CDNs.</description>
