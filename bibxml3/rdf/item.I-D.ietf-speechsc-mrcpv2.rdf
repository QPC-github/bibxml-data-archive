    <title>"Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2)", Daniel Burnett, Saravanan Shanmugham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-speechsc-mrcpv2-28.pdf</link>
    <description>The MRCPv2 protocol allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers and identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on other protocols, such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to rendezvous MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover and exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 protocol exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.</description>
