    <description>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches including point-to-point links and multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) routing. This document specifies the establishment, reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacencies between TRILL switches, also known as RBridges. It also concerns four other link- local aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi-Directional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection with adjacency. State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.</description>
