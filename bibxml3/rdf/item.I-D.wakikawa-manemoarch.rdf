    <description>This document outlines the MANEMO architecture including possible topology configuration and addressing assignment. The issues of MANEMO (previously known as nested NEMO) are already summarized in several documents. However, there are several ways how to comprehend what is MANEMO. The MANEMO problems are related to several existing working groups. This document provides the MANEMO architecture model and differences of existing solutions so that IETF can classify the problems and start working on the solutions.</description>
