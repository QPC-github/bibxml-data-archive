    <description>In this document, a convergence layer for CCNx and NDN over IEEE 802.15.4 LoWPAN networks is defined.  A new frame format is specified to adapt CCNx and NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4. For that, syntactic and semantic changes to the TLV-based header formats are described.  To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by 6LoWPAN is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN.  Additionally, the link fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to ICN chunks.  Basic improvements in efficiency are advised by stateless and stateful compression schemes.</description>
