    <description>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) being specified jointly by IETF and ITU-T includes requirements documents and framework documents. The framework documents define the basic architecture that is needed in order to support various aspects of the required behavior.  This document addresses the functionality described in the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document and defines a protocol that may be used to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination for linear protection, as described in that document.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
