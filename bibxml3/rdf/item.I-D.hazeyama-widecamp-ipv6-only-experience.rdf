    <description>This document reports and discusses issues on IPv6 only networks and IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies through our experiences on the 3rd experiment on the WIDE camp.  The 3rd experiment was held from September 3rd to September 6th, 2012.  As well as past two experiments, we conducted face to face interview to participants for grasping IPv6 capability on users' devices, OSes, and applications. In addition to this, we explored solutions to mitigate timeout / fallback problems of IPv4/IPv6 dual stack clients on an IPv6 only network that is composed of DHCP6 and DNS64/NAT64.</description>
