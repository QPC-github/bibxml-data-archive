    <description>Meeting quality of service (QoS) in a network is challenging. DiffServe architecture, given in [RFC2474] has been proposed as a solution. However, it results in a kind of self-simlalarity in the network traffic. The method results in the reduction of bit rates and discard of cells during congestion. It requires re transmission of the same data. Alternatively, the information input can be reduced with hierarchical arrangement of data in to different levels of abstraction. With the increased load on the network, the complexity of meeting QoS and the issues of congestion are to be transferred to the receiver from the network.</description>
