        <description>Service functions are deployed as, physical or virtualized elements along with network nodes or on servers in data centers.  Segment Routing (SR) brings in the concept of segments which can be topological or service instructions.  Service segments are SR segments that are associated with service functions.  SR Policies are used for the setup of paths for steering of traffic through service functions using their service segments.  BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables distribution of topology information from the network to a controller or an application in general so it can learn the network topology.  This document specifies the extensions to BGP-LS for the advertisement of service functions along their associated service segments.  The BGP-LS advertisement of service function information along with the network nodes that they are attached to, or associated with, enables controllers compute and setup service paths in the network.</description>
