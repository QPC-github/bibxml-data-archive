    <title>"Multi-Upstream Interfaces IGMP/MLD Proxy", Hong-Ke Zhang, Thomas Schmidt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhang-pim-muiimp-02.txt</link>
    <description>In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1] and subsequently  updated  in  [2],  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to the same data simultaneously.</description>
