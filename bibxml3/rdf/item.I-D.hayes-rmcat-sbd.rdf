    <title>"Shared Bottleneck Detection for Coupled Congestion Control for RTP Media.", David Hayes, Simone Ferlin, Michael Welzl</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hayes-rmcat-sbd-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism to detect whether end-to-end data flows share a common bottleneck.  It relies on summary statistics that are calculated by a data receiver based on continuous measurements and regularly fed to a grouping algorithm that runs wherever the knowledge is needed.  This mechanism complements the coupled congestion control mechanism in draft-welzl-rmcat-coupled-cc.</description>
