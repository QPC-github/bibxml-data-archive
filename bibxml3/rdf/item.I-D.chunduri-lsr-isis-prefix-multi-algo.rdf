    <title>"Multiple Algorithm support for IS-IS Prefixes", Uma Chunduri, Yingzhen Qu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chunduri-lsr-isis-prefix-multi-algo-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol by adding an Algorithm support for prefixes advertised.  This allows multiple independent algorithm usage for computing the reachability of nodes and prefixes as opposed to only one algorithm.</description>
