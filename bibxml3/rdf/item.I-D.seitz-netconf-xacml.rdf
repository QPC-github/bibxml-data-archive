    <title>"NETCONF access control profile for XACML", Ludwig Seitz, Erik Rissanen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-seitz-netconf-xacml-02.txt</link>
    <description>The NETCONF remote network configuration protocol currently lacks an access control model.  The need for such a model has been recognised within the NETCONF working group.  The eXtended Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is an XML-based access control standard, with widespread acceptance from the industry and good open-source support. This document proposes a profile that defines how to use XACML to provide fine-grain access control for NETCONF commands.</description>
