    <title>"Network Address Translation Support for QUIC", Martin Duke</title>

    <description>Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share scarce public IPv4 addresses among multiple end hosts.  They overwrite IP addresses and ports in IP packets to do so.  QUIC is a protocol on top of UDP that provides transport-like services.  QUIC is better-behaved in the presence of NATs than older protocols, and existing UDP NATs should operate without incident if unmodified. QUIC offers additional features that may tempt NAT implementers as potential optimizations.  However, in practice, leveraging these features will lead to new connection failure modes and security vulnerabilities.</description>
