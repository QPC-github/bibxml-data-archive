    <title>"Loopback Prefix for IPv6", Edward Lewis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ipversion6-loopback-prefix-00.txt</link>
    <description>The IPv6 address range of 0::/64 is reserved for loopback addresses. This expands from the single loophack address already defined for IPv6, ::1, to allow for a set of addresses to be used when packets are intended to stay within a host system.  Multiple loopback addresses allow for simultaneous varied uses of the loopback addresses as has proven, albeit in limited ways, in IPv4.  And exception is made to accomodate the ::0/128, already defined as The Unspecified Address.</description>
