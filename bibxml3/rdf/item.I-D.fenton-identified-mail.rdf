    <description>This document describes extensions to the format of electronic mail messages and a public-key infrastructure to permit verification of the source of messages by either mail transport agents (MTAs) or mail user agents (MUAs). This may be used to implement a policy which, for example, favors the delivery of identified messages over messages lacking signatures or having incorrect signatures. Mechanisms by which signing of messages and verification of signatures can be performed by trusted MTAs, in order to minimize impact on end users, are also presented.</description>
