    <description>IEEE Std 802.16 is an air interface specification for fxed and mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems.  Service specific convergence sublayers to which upper layer protocols interface are a part of the IEEE 802.16 MAC (Medium Access Control).  The Packet convergence sublayer is used for the transport of all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP) and, IEEE 802.3 LAN/MAN CSMA/CD Access Method (Ethernet).  IPv6 packets can be sent and received via the IP specific part of the packet convergence sublayer.  This document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IP specific part of the packet CS for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface.  It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated interface identifiers.</description>
