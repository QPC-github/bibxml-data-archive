    <description>In MPLS and MPLS-TP environments, statically provisioned Single- Segment Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  With statically provisioned Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs), each segment of the MS-PW is likewise protected from tunnel failures via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection.  However, static MS-PWs are not protected end-to-end against failure of one of the switching PEs (S-PEs) along the path of the MS-PW.  This document describes how to achieve this protection by updating the existing procedures in RFC 6870.  It also contains an optional approach based on MPLS-TP Linear Protection.</description>
