    <description>This document describes procedures to support node protection for unicast Label Switched Paths (LSPs) established by Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) of N must discover the Merge Points (MPs) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in case of node N failure. Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing point-to-point LSPs originated from the PLR to the MPs while bypassing the protected node N.  The procedures described in this document are topology independent in a sense that they provide node protection in any topology so long as there is a alternate path in the network that avoids the protected node.</description>
