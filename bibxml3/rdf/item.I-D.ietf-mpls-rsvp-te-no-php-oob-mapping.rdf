    <title>"Non Penultimate Hop Popping Behavior and out-of-band mapping for RSVP-TE Label Switched Paths", Zafar Ali, George Swallow, Rahul Aggarwal</title>

    <description>There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress Label Switching Router (LSR) to receive binding of the Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineered (RSVP-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to an application, and payload identification, using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document defines protocol mechanisms to address this requirement. The procedures described in this document are equally applicable for point-to- point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.</description>
