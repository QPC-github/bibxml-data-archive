    <title>"Supporting Media Independent Handover Protocols with GIST", Robert Hancock, Eleanor Hepworth</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hancock-mipshop-gist-for-mih-00.txt</link>
    <description>The MIPSHOP working group is working on common functionality necessary for the support of media independent handover (MIH) protocols, initially focussing on the architectures being developed with the 802.21 working group of the IEEE. A problem statement draft describing the context and scope of the common functionality is already in progress, and a second draft has been prepared that describes the main protocol design issues that have to be taken into consideration. Although the common functionality (relating to transport and security requirements) is mainly standard, there is still a significant element of protocol design to integrate them with the MIH service itself, including in particular secure peer discovery and capability negotiation. This draft presents a solution for the common protocol functionality based on the use of the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol, which has been developed in the NSIS working group. GIST can already satisfy the bulk of the protocol requirements in its current form, and this draft explains how this existing GIST functionality fits into the MIH problem space. The main special requirements for MIH relate to signalling node discovery and message routing, and this draft outlines three options for supporting these requirements within the GIST framework</description>
