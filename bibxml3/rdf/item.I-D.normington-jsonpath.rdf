    <description>JSONPath defines a string syntax for identifying values within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document.  Note  *This document is a work in progress and has not yet been published as an Internet Draft* (which needs to be fixed soon).  Contributing  This document picks up the popular JSONPath specification dated 2007-02-21 and provides a normative definition for it.  In its current state, it is a strawman document showing what needs to be covered.  Comments and issues can be directed at the github repository _insert repo here_ as well as (for the time when the more permanent home is being decided) at the dispatch@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
