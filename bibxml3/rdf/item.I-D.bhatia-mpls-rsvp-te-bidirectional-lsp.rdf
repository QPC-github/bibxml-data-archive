    <title>"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Bi-directional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)", Manav Bhatia, LiZhong Jin, Frederic JOUNAY</title>

    <description>There are several applications that require symmetric Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) path between two points.  This cannot be achieved with regular MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional.  If symmetry is required, a separate LSP in each direction is required for bidirectional traffic flow.  Generalized MPLS on the other hand, has provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP.  This document uses the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regular MPLS for establishing bidirectional LSPs.  Additionally, it also describes how bi-directional symmetrical Fast Reroute using both one- to-one and facility backup can be achieved.</description>
