    <title>"Use of Bit 0x20 in DNS Labels to Improve Transaction Identity", Paul Vixie, David Dagon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20-00.txt</link>
    <description>The small (16-bit) size of the DNS transaction ID has made it a frequent target for forgery, with the unhappy result of many cache pollution vulnerabilities demonstrated throughout Internet history. Even with perfectly and unpredictably random transaction ID's, random and birthday attacks are still theoretically feasible.  This document describes a method by which an initiator can improve transaction identity using the 0x20 bit in DNS labels.</description>
