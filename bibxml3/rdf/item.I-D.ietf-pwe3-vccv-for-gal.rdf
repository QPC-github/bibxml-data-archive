    <title>"A Unified Control Channel for Pseudowires", Tom Nadeau, Luca Martini, Stewart Bryant</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pwe3-vccv-for-gal-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a unified mode of operation for Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW).  VCCV applies to all supported access circuit and transport types currently defined for PWs, as well as those being transported by the MPLS Transport Profile.  This new mode is intended to augment those described in RFC5085.  It describes new rules requiring this mode to be used as the default/mandatory mode of operation for VCCV.  The older VCCV types will remain optional.</description>
