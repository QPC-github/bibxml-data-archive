    <description>The RPC port mapper described in [1] and [2] allows a service to bind to any free TCP or UDP port. A client that wants to establish a connection to a server will ask the RPC portmapper for the TCP or UDP port of the service and establish the connection.  The problem is that clients now need to know the RPC application number of the service they want to connect to. These numbers are assigned by the IANA for registered applications. For "experimental" applications there is a range of application numbers that is managed by the local network's administrator.  Especially when using such "experimental" applications in wide area networks there is the problem that the client needs to know the server application's RPC application number.  The protocol described in this document allows a server host the dynamical assigning of RPC numbers. It allows clients to ask the server for for RPC number by the application name.</description>
