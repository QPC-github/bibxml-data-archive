    <description>The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IPID for fragmentation and reassembly.  This field was commonly used by network diagnosticians for tracking packets on multi-tier networks. In IPv6, the IPID has been moved to the Fragment header.  A new Diagnostic header for IPv6 which can be sent with every packet as a part of the Destination Options header with a 64-bit IPID is defined in this document.</description>
