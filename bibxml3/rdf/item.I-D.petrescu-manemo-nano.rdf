    <title>"The NANO Draft (Scene Scenario for Mobile Routers and MNP in RA)", Alexandru  Petrescu, Christophe Janneteau</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-petrescu-manemo-nano-00.txt</link>
    <description>This short NANO draft proposes scenarios for using Mobile Routers at fixed scenes. The routers connect by their egress interfaces and need to allow their Local Fixed Nodes to communicate directly. What if the Mobile Network Prefixes are stored in special Router Advertisements sent by each Mobile Router on their egress interface. What are the issues and can it work.</description>
