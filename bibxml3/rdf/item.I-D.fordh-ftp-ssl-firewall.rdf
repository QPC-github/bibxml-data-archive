    <description>This document discusses some of the issues with running FTP, secured with TLS as defined in [FTP-TLS], through firewalls. FTP is known to be a bit of a problem for firewalls (see [RFC-1579] for a discussion of normal FTP and firewalls). Some of the problems have been fixed by adding intelligence into the firewall. With secured FTP, where the control connection is encrypted, some of these techniques fail. Whilst this document confines itself to issues of FTP over TLS, the issues will probably be relevant for most secured FTP protocols that conform to [RFC-2228]. Some of the discussions will also be relevant to any protocol that firewalls do clever things with.</description>
