    <description>DIAP has been created to solve mid-range and below, long term archiving requirements of the small medium enterprise.  Where tape has been deployed in the past, DIAP now offers an alternative solution designed to be more robust and manageable in the long term than network attached storage devices or simple disk storage alone. The system provides a well defined structure for storing and managing long term archives.</description>
