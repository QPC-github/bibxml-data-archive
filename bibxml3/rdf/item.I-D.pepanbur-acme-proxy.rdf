    <description>This document proposes an addition to the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) draft describing the ability for a publicly facing ACME client to operate as an enrollment proxy for hosts on its private network as defined by [RFC1918] and [RFC4193]. ACME clients acting as a proxy are identified using the cmcRA flag [RFC6402].</description>
