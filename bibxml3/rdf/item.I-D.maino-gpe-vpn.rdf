    <description>GPE-VPN is an architecture for programmable SD-WAN solutions that leverages the Generic Protocol Encapsulation (GPE) overlay.  GPE-VPN uses an extended LISP-based map-assisted control plane to dynamically lookup forwarding policies on demand.  A northbound programmable mapping system is used to store and retrieve mappings and forwarding policies.  The GPE-VPN data plane is secured with IPsec based encryption.  Overlay tunnels, as well as cryptographic parameters, are provisioned on demand.</description>
