    <title>"TLS Metadata for Load Balancers", Benjamin Schwartz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schwartz-tls-lb-02.txt</link>
    <description>A load balancer that does not terminate TLS may wish to provide some information to the backend server, in addition to forwarding TLS data.  This draft proposes a protocol between load balancers and backends that enables secure, efficient delivery of TLS with additional information.  The need for such a protocol has recently become apparent in the context of split mode ESNI.</description>
