    <description>Signature is adopted as the fundamental function in Content-Centric Networking (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN).  Its service and performance rely heavily on the key management (KM) schemes, which are the processes to generate, deliver, store, protect, update, and revoke cryptographic keys.  This document describes the use scenarios and further requirements for KM schemes in CCN/NDN.</description>
