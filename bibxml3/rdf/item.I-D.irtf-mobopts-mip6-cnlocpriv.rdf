    <title>"MIPv6 Correspondent Node-Targeted Location Privacy and Optimized Routing", Kilian Weniger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-mobopts-mip6-cnlocpriv-00.txt</link>
    <description>Mobile IPv6 does not allow a mobile node to hide its location from a correspondent node without compromising optimized routing.  Hence, a mobile node has the choice: it can either get location privacy support or short packet delay, but not both at the same time.  This document discusses the problem of achieving both simultaneously and specifies a solution.  The solution utilizes the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping mechanisms and does neither introduce new network entities nor changes to home agent or correspondent node implementations.</description>
