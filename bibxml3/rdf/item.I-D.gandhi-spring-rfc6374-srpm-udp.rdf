    <title>"Performance Measurement Using RFC 6374 with UDP Path for Segment Routing Networks", Rakesh Gandhi, Clarence Filsfils, Daniel Voyer, Stefano Salsano, Mach Chen</title>

    <description>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR- MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document specifies procedures for using UDP path for sending and processing probe query and response messages for Performance Measurement (PM).  The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 6374 for Performance Delay and Loss Measurement.  The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies measurements.</description>
