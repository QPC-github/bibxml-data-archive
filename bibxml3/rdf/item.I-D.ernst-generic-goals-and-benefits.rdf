    <title>"Goals and Benefits of Multihoming", Thierry Ernst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ernst-generic-goals-and-benefits-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document attempts to define the goals and benefits of multihoming for fixed and mobile nodes (hosts and routers), i.e. from a node point of view, as investigated in the Monami6 WG, and not from a site point of view as investigated in the Shim6 WG. Those goals and benefits are illustrated with a set of scenarios. This document is generic in the sense that the benefits of node multihoming can be shared by both fixed end nodes and mobile end nodes. It is intended to satisfy the first item as specified on the Monami6 charter and as such, working group approval as a working group document will be sought.</description>
