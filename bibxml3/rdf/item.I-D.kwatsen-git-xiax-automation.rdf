    <title>"eXtract or Insert artwork And source code to/from Xml (xiax)", Kent Watsen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kwatsen-git-xiax-automation-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes motivations behind and solutions for tooling to automate the extraction/insertion of artwork and source code to/ from `rfc2xml` documents.  While much may appear to be working, the author believes that, in order for such automation to be maximally useful, it is necessary to solicit broad input from the community (co-authors are welcomed, both on the draft and the tool).</description>
