    <description>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when B2BUA, proxies, and user agents have insufficient resources like CPU, memory, DSP, DS0, disk resources or available bandwidth to complete the processing of a request.  SIP provides limited support for overload handling through its 503 response code, which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded.  This document defines explicit SIP based resource monitoring and overload avoidance mechanism based on the resource availability of the entity.</description>
