    <description>This document specifies VPLS extensions to support the new VLAN aware bundling service interface type. The new service interface type provides advantages in reducing the provisioning overhead, as well as pseudowire scalability in environments where a large number of VLANs need to be extended over an MPLS/IP network while maintaining traffic segregation among those VLANs.  The VLAN aware bundling service interface can handle the high scale requirements of today's Data Centers by bundling different VLANs over a single WAN VPLS instance used to interconnect sites. Furthermore, this document specifies an extension to the LDP MAC Withdrawal mechanisms to allow per-VLAN MAC flushing for the new service interface type.</description>
