    <description>Current Internet trends in several fields have brought some security concerns with regards to what will happen with the current security paradigms and mechanisms. This document analyzes two security paradigms, the network-based and the host-based. The former refers to what is being used nowadays out there and the latter is based on the distributed firewall concept [2]. From the point of view of these security concerns it is stated that there is a problem that must be addressed. Some insights are given with respect to the host-based security paradigm.</description>
