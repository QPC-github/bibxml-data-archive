    <title>"Basic Password Exchange within the Flexible Authentication via Secure  Tunneling Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-FAST)", Nancy Cam-Winget, Hao Zhou</title>

    <description>The flexible authentication via secure tunneling EAP method (EAP- FAST) enables secure communication between a peer and a server by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually authenticated tunnel.  Within this tunnel a basic password exchange, based on the generic token card method (EAP-GTC), may be executed to authenticate the peer.</description>
