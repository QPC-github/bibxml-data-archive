    <title>"Operation of a Dual-Stack Multicast Router With Address Translation", Tom Taylor, Cathy Zhou</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-taylor-pim-v4v6-translation-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the procedures required for correct operation of a multicast router in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, where some or all of the multicast group and unicast source addresses can be translated between IPv4 and IPv6, and where incoming multicast data may need to be forwarded into both IPv4 and IPv6 distribution trees.  The router is assumed to support Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM, RFC 4601) in an environment consisting of a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 local hosts and PIM peers. The work is easily generalized to other versions of PIM.</description>
