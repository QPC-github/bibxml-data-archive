    <description>This memo specifies requirements for IPv6 forwarders as they process packets with long header chains.  It also provides guidance for application developers whose applications might rely on long headers chains.  As background, this memo explains how many ASIC-based IPv6 forwarders process packets and why processing of packets with long header chains might be problematic.</description>
