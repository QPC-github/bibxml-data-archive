        <description>BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route stability.  It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing CPU load on the routers.  But it has side-effects.  Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]).  Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable].  This document describes results of a survey conducted among service provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.</description>
