    <description>DNSSEC is trying to be deployed everywhere.  Many are afraid of DNSSEC deployment, which are too heavy to be deployed.  There is a huge gap between the resources we need to deploy DNSSEC and the benefits or security we can get from the DNSSEC.  This document proposes a lightweight DNSSEC mechanism to make the DNSSEC to be deployed easily while getting the similar security with the heavy DNSSEC.</description>
