    <description>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi- domain scenarios easier to support through a standardized service. Examples include but are not limited to enterprise to cloud service providers, and inter-cloud based scenarios.  This specification extends the SCIM Protocol to include support for HTTP SEARCH.</description>
