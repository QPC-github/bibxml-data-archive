    <description>The Generalized PWid FEC permits a procedure know as single-sided signaling as documented. In this procedure, one end of the pseudowire always initiates the pseudowire setup and the target of that label mapping message only signals in response. For certain applications of pseudowires it is advantages to configure the pseudowire type (PW type) at the target of the initial label mapping message. This document specifies a means of doing this.</description>
