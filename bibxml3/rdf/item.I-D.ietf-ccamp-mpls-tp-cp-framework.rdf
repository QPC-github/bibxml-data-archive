    <description>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS), and dynamic provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning, and covers control plane addressing, routing, path computation, signaling, traffic engineering, and path recovery.  MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  MPLS-TP also uses the Pseudowire (PW) control plane for Pseudowires (PWs).  Management plane functions are out of scope of this document.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.  This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last Call.  [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF consensus.]</description>
