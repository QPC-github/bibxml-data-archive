    <title>"Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)", Chris Stoner</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cstoner-rfc2445bis-00.txt</link>
    <description>Calendar systems export, transport and sometimes even store calendar information in a standard, interoperable format. This memo defines the common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the Internet, known as the iCalendar object format. An iCalendar object may represent an event, to-do or task, or journal entry (note). Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org and/or the editor.</description>
