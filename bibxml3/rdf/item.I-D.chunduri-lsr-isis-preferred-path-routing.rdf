        <description>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR), a routing protocol mechanism to simplify the path description using IS-IS protocol.  PPR builds on existing encapsulation to add the path identity to the packet and supports further extensions along the preferred paths.  PPR aims to provide path steering, services and support further extensions along the paths.  Preferred path routing is achieved through the addition of path descriptions to the IS-IS advertised prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</description>
