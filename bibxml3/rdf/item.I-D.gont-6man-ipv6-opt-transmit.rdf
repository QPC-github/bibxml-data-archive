    <description>Various IPv6 options have been standardized since the core IPv6 standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to clarify how nodes should deal with such IPv6 options and with any options that are defined in the future.  It complements [RFC7045], which offers a similar clarification regarding IPv6 Extension Headers.</description>
