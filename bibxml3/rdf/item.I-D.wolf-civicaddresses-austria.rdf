    <title>"Considerations for Civic Addresses in PIDF-LO", Karl Wolf, Alexander  Mayrhofer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wolf-civicaddresses-austria-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a guideline for creating civic address consideration documents for individual countries, as required by RFC 4776.  Since civic addresses may have a different format in individual countries, such address considerations are necessary in order to map the civic address elements to the PIDF Location Object (PIDF-LO) elements.</description>
