    <description>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is typically used in conjunction with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for establishing multimedia sessions on the Internet.  Typically these sessions include audio, video or messaging streams.  Rich collaboration applications can complete these multimedia sessions, including view sharing with remote manipulation, co-web browsing, and file transfer.This document discusses rich collaboration between two endpoints and provides conventions and extension to SDP to enable these applications.</description>
