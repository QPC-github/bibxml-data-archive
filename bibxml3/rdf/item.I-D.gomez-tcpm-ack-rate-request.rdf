        <description>TCP Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) is a widely deployed mechanism that allows reducing protocol overhead in many scenarios.  However, Delayed ACKs may also contribute to suboptimal performance.  When a relatively large congestion window (cwnd) can be used, less frequent ACKs may be desirable.  On the other hand, in relatively small cwnd scenarios, eliciting an immediate ACK may avoid unnecessary delays that may be incurred by the Delayed ACKs mechanism.  This document specifies the TCP ACK Rate Request (TARR) option.  This option allows a sender to request the ACK rate to be used by a receiver, and it also allows to request immediate ACKs from a receiver.</description>
