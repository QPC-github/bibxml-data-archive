    <description>A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain key information fields are made available to facilitate path computation and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs). The information model described in "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks" shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON. Part of the WSON information model contains aspects that may be of general applicability to other technologies, while other parts are specific to WSONs.  This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the WSON-specific information fields. It is intended that protocol- specific documents will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses. Such encodings can be used to extend GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. In addition these encodings could be used by other mechanisms to convey this same information to a path computation element (PCE).</description>
