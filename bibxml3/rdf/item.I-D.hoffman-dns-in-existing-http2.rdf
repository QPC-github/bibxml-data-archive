    <title>"Running DNS in Existing HTTP/2 Connections", Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-dns-in-existing-http2-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document has a likely-bad suggestion of how to run DNS service over existing HTTP/2 connections over TLS, such as those being used for HTTP for basic web service.  The author no longer recommends to do this.</description>
