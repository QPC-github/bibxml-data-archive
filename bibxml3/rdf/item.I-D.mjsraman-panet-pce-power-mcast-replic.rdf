    <description>Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease power consumption overall assumes importance. Multicast replication capacity is an attribute of every line card of major routers and multi-layer switches that support multicast in the core of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise network.  Currently multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint Traffic Engineering Label-Switched-Paths (P2MP TE-LSPs) consume power while delivering multiple output streams of data from a given input stream. The multicast distribution trees are constructed without any regard for a proper placement of the replication points and consequent optimal power consumption at these points.  This results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing others. An optimal usage of these replication resources could substantially reduce power consumption on these routers. In this paper, we propose a mechanism by which P2MP TE-LSPs are constructed for carrying multicast traffic across multiple areas within a given AS. We propose that these LSPs be built by using the advertisements of the power-replication capacity ratio advertised by fine grained components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers and multi- layer switches deployed within an AS.</description>
