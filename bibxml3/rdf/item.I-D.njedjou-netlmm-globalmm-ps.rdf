    <title>"Problem Statement for Global IP Mobility Management", Eric Njedjou, Julien  Riera</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-njedjou-netlmm-globalmm-ps-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses the problem of global IP mobility management in a context where some mobile operators and service providers are looking for adequate solutions to the inter-system IP mobility problem. The document addresses the specific issue of moving between IP access domains that use different mobility management protocols and mechanisms. Indeed this type of movement would be an important subset of global IP mobility scenarios.</description>
