    <title>"ALTO Information Redistribution Considered Harmful", Martin Stiemerling</title>

    <description>The merged ALTO protocol proposal proposes several mechanisms to increase scalability of the protocol.  One of the proposed mechanisms is the distribution of ALTO information directly between the peers without any involvement of the server.  This memo discusses why the proposed mechanism is considered harmful and why the proposed security framework is deployable.</description>
