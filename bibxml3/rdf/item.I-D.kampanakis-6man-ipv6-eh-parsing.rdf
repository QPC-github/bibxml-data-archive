    <title>"Implementation Guidelines for parsing IPv6 Extension Headers", Panos Kampanakis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing-01.txt</link>
    <description>IPv6 is widely used on the internet today and is expected to be deployed more as more devices (i.e. home automation) get inter- connected.  The IPv6 header format allows for the use of Extension Headers (EH).  EHs could be chained together with very few existing guidelines by the IPv6 protocol on how devices should parse them, which open room for security concerns and inconsistencies.  This document presents guidelines for parsing IPv6 EHs with a goal of providing a common and consistent parsing methodology for IPv6 implementers among the industry.</description>
