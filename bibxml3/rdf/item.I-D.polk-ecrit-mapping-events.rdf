    <title>"Analyzing ECRIT Mapping of a Location to an Emergency URI for Emergency  Calling", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-ecrit-mapping-events-00.txt</link>
    <description>Emergency calling is a localized event, requiring a caller to place an specially identified local emergency call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), while including the location of the caller in that signaling. The function of routing the set-up messaging to the appropriate PSAP is performed by a mapping function that binds a given location with one or more PSAP SIP(S)-URIs. This function is done by the ECRIT mapping protocol. This document analyzes when the ECRIT mapping protocol function can occur, and what general components are involved in that mapping.</description>
