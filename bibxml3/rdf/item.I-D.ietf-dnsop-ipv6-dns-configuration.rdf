    <title>"IPv6 Host Configuration of DNS Server Information Approaches", Jae-Hoon  Jeong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsop-ipv6-dns-configuration-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes three approaches for IPv6 recursive DNS server address configuration. It details the operational attributes of three solutions: RA option, DHCPv6 option, and Well-known anycast addresses for recursive DNS servers. Additionally, it suggests the deployment scenarios in four kinds of networks, such as ISP, Enterprise, 3GPP, and Unmanaged networks, considering multi-solution resolution. Therefore, this document will give the audience a guideline for IPv6 host DNS configuration.</description>
