    <description>LSP-Ping is an existing and widely deployed OAM mechanism for MPLS LSPs.  This document describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP- Ping can be used to perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs.  It also clarifies the procedures to be used for processing the OAM packets.  Further, it describes how LSP-Ping can be used to perform Connectivity Verification, Route Tracing and Adjacency functions in MPLS-TP networks.</description>
