    <title>"Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints for STIR Certificates", Russ Housley</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-housley-stir-enhance-rfc8226-00.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225.  If the signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document defines additional ways that the JWT claims can be constrained.</description>
