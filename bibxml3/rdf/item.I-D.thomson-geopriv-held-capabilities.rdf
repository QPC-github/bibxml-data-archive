    <description>A Device is a valuable source of information about its location.  A Location Information Server (LIS) that serves a location URI about a Device is unable to acquire this information.  Extensions to HTTP- Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) are described for negotiating and exercising Device capabilities for location determination or location measurement collection.</description>
