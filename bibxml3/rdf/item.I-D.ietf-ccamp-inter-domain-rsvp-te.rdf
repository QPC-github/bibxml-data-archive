    <title>"Inter domain Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS  (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering - RSVP-TE extensions", Arthi Ayyangar</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-rsvp-te-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes procedures and protocol extensions for the use of Resource ReserVation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) packet networks and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) packet and non-packet networks to support the establishment and maintenance of Label Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries.  For the purpose of this document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network elements within a common realm of address space or path computation responsibility. Examples of such domains include Autonomous Systems, IGP routing areas, and GMPLS overlay networks.</description>
