    <title>"The AES-CMAC-96 Algorithm and its use with IPsec", Junhyuk Song</title>

    <description>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has newly specified the Cipher based MAC (CMAC) which is equivalent to the One-Key CBC-MAC1 (OMAC1) algorithm submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa. OMAC1 efficiently reduces the key size of Extended Cipher Block Chaining mode (XCBC). This memo specifies the use of CMAC mode on authentication mechanism of IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) protocols. This new algorithm is named AES-CMAC-96.</description>
