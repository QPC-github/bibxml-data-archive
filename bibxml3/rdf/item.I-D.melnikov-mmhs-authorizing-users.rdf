    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melnikov-mmhs-authorizing-users-14.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a procedure for when an Military Message Handling System (MMHS) message is composed by one user and is only released to the mail transfer system when one or more authorizing users authorize release of the message by adding the MMHS- Authorizing-Users header field.  The resulting message can be optionally signed by the sender and/or reviewer, allowing recipients to verify both the original signature (if any) and review signatures.</description>
