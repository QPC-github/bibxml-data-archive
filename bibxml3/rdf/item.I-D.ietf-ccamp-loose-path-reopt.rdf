    <title>"Reoptimization of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering  (TE) loosely routed Label Switch Path (LSP)", JP Vasseur</title>

    <description>This document defines a mechanism for the reoptimization of loosely routed MPLS and GMPLS (Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching) Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs signaled with RSVP-TE. This document proposes a mechanism that allows a TE LSP head-end LSR to trigger a new path re-evaluation on every hop having a next hop defined as a loose or abstract hop and a mid-point LSR to signal to the head-end LSR that a better path exists (compared to the current path in use) or that the TE LSP must be reoptimized because of some maintenance required on the TE LSP path. The proposed mechanism applies to the cases of intra and inter-domain (IGP area or Autonomous System) packet and non-packet TE LSPs following a loosely routed path.</description>
