    <description>A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) is what mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable policy control.  This applies both in the protocol itself and in the services associated with the different components of the routing system.  Similarly, the data-models associated with the services must be capable of expressing the appropriate granularity for access and authorization-related policy.  This document describes the policy framework for I2RS.</description>
