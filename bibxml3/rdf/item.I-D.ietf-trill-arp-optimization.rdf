    <description>This document describes mechanisms to optimize the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and ND (Neighbor Discovery) traffic in a TRILL campus. TRILL switches maintain a cache of IP/MAC address/Data Label bindings that are learned from ARP/ND requests and responses that pass through them. In many cases, this cache allows an edge RBridge to avoid flooding an ARP/ND request by either responding to it directly or by encapsulating it and unicasting it. Such optimization reduces packet flooding over a TRILL campus.</description>
