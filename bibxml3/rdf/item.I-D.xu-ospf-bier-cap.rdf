    <title>"Advertising Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) Capability Using OSPF", Xiaohu Xu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xu-ospf-bier-cap-00.txt</link>
    <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding paradigm which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and doesn't require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state. A BFR cannot send a BIER packet to a given nexthop router unless that nexthop router has indicated that it can support the BIER forwarding procedure.  This document defines a mechanism to signal that capability using OSPF.  This mechanism is useful when the unicast route distribution is also done via OSPF.</description>
