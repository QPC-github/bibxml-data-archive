        <description>Network telemetry is a technology for gaining network insight and facilitating efficient and automated network management.  It encompasses various techniques for remote data generation, collection, correlation, and consumption.  This document describes an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by challenges that are encountered as part of the operation of networks and by the requirements that ensue.  This document clarifies the terminologies and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry system from different perspectives.  The framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for related technique and standard developments.</description>
