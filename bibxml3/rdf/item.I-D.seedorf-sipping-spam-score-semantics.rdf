    <title>"Spam score for SIP: a proposal for semantics", Jan Seedorf, Saverio  Niccolini, Henning Schulzrinne</title>

    <description>This document reports a proposal for semantics of SIP spam scoring in order to achieve a flexible signalling standardization allowing an incremental adoption of the scoring mechanism.  This approach can give early experimental implementers the possibility to start using spam scoring extensions in an explorative fashion without running into interoperability problems.</description>
