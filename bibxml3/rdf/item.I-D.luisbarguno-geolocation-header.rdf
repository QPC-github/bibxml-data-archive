    <title>"Geolocation Header for HTTP over a Secure Context", Luis Barguno</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-luisbarguno-geolocation-header-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Geolocation header introduces a mechanism to send a device location over an HTTP Secure Context from a user agent to a server.  The Geolocation-Request header is used by a server to inform the user agent when a Geolocation header is requested to be sent.  This mechanism, through persistent Geolocation-Requests, provides a single-roundtrip solution to obtain location-aware responses for location-aware services, as oposed to existing JS-based Geolocation API that require two round trips.</description>
