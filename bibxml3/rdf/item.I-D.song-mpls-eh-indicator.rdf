        <description>The intention of this document is to enumerate and describe the candidate schemes that can be used to indicate the presence of the MPLS extension header(s) following the MPLS label stack.  After a careful evaluation of these options by comparing their pros and cons, it is expected that one should be chosen as the final standard scheme for MPLS extension header indicator.</description>
