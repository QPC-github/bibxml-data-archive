    <description>RFC5239 defines the idea of a centralized conferencing (XCON) as an association of participants with a central focus.  The state of a conference is represented by a conference object.  This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based conference information data model to be used for conference objects.  A conference information data model is designed to convey information about the conference and about participation in the conference.  The conference information data model defined in this document constitutes an extension of the data format specified in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State.</description>
