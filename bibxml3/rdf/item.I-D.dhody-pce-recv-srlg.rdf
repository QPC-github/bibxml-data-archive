    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering (TE) in networks controlled by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).  This document provides extensions for the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) to receive Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) information during path computation via encoding this information in the path computation reply message.  The document is currently dead as there is little interest in this as of now.</description>
