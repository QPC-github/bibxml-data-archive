    <title>"The Extended LDAP Data Interchange Format (EXLDIF)", Christian Hollstein</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hollstein-extended-ldif-01.txt</link>
    <description>LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) has been specified in RFC2849. It covers the LDAP operations ADD, MODIFY, DELETE and MODDN. This document specifies how other LDAP operations can be represented in a text file. Implementations may take such text files to send appropriate LDAP requests to a server and process the responses. This work was inspired by the need for a general configurable LDAP client used in functional and stress testing of LDAP servers.</description>
