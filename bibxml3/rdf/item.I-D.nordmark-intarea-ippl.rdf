    <title>"IP over Intentionally Partially Partitioned Links", Erik Nordmark</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nordmark-intarea-ippl-05.txt</link>
    <description>IP makes certain assumptions about the L2 forwarding behavior of a multi-access IP link.  However, there are several forms of intentional partitioning of links ranging from split-horizon to Private VLANs that violate some of those assumptions.  This document specifies that link behavior and how IP handles links with those properties.</description>
