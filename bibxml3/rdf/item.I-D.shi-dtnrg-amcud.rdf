    <description>This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the unpredictable disruption problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based reliability for bundles, several times of retransmissions can be seen as a failure occurred over links. The proposed mechanism is used to direct the following packets to other nodes and probes the availability of the links which has disrupted unexpectedly.</description>
