    <title>"Entropy label for seamless MPLS", Ravi Singh, Yimin Shen, John Drake</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ravisingh-mpls-el-for-seamless-mpls-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes certain optimizations to how entropy labels can be used for load balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture, as enabled by LSP concatenation and LSP hierarchies.  The definition of the control plane and data plane behavior at LSP concatenation points; and at the ingress of an LSP in a hierarchy of LSPs, as described in this document, brings the benefits of entropy labels to certain deployment scenarios that may not have had such benefits as specified in [EL-RFC].  This document, if approved, updates RFC 6790.</description>
