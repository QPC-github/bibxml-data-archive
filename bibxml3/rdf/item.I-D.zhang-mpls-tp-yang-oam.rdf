    <description>The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP), specified in RFC 5921, is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and pseudowire (PW) data- plane architectures.  A comprehensive set of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) procedures that fulfill the MPLS-TP OAM requirements for fault, performance, and protection- switching management had been defined.  YANG, defined in RFC 6020 and RFC 7950, is a data model definition language that was introduced to define the content of a conceptual data stores that allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF, as specified in RFC 6241.  This document presents the YANG Data model for MPLS-TP OAM, including the basic functions of Fault Management and Performance Monitoring.</description>
