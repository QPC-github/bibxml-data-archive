    <description>Media recording enables the parties of a conversation to record all or part of the conversation. Automatic recording may bring great convenience to users. However, federal law requires the parties of a conversation to have a consent for media recording. In addition, FCC requires the recorded parties must be notified before the recording. These requirements make automatic recording impossible without defining a mechanism to negotiate the consent and send recording notifications. This document defines a SIP event package for recording event notifications and use the SIP CONSENT method to negotiate a consent among multiple parties for media recording.</description>
