    <description>Internet Key Exchange is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication as well as establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs) between two parties such as a user and a network entity.  Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol allows several different mechanisms for authenticating a user, namely the Extensible Authentication Protocol, certificates, and pre-shared secrets.  To authenticate and/or authorize the user, the network element such as the Access Gateway may need to dynamically bootstrap a security association based on interaction with the Diameter server. This document specifies the interaction between the Access Gateway and Diameter server for the IKEv2 based on pre-shared secrets.</description>
