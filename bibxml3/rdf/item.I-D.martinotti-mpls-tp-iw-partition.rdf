    <title>"Network Partitioning deployment scenario between MPLS-TP and IP/MPLS", Riccardo Martinotti, Diego Caviglia, Nurit Sprecher, Alessandro D'Alessandro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martinotti-mpls-tp-iw-partition-00.txt</link>
    <description>Purpose of this ID is to illustrate deployment scenarios between network supporting MPLS-TP and network supporting IP/MPLS, where there is a network partitioning relationship between them.  Main interworking aspects, issues and open points are highlighted.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</description>
