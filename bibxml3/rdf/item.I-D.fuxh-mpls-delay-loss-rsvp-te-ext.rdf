    <description>With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the distances between the user and the applications are growing.  For multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the response times are critical as is packet loss, while other applications require more throughput.  For example, financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to- end private pipe line delay optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms. Delay, jitter, loss and SLA (Service Level Agreement) are key parameters that these "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider.  This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to promote SLA experince of delay and packet loss application.</description>
