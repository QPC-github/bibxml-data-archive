    <description>SUPA will define a generic policy model, an imperative ECA (Event Condition Action) policy information model and a declarative (intent- based) policy information model which is the extension of the generic model, and a set of policy data models which will make use of the common concepts defined in the generic model.  This memo will explore some typical use cases and demonstrate the applicability of SUPA policy models.</description>
