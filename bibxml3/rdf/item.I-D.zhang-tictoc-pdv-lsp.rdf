    <title>"PDV-based PTP LSP Setup,Reoptimization and Recovery", Junhui Zhang, Liang Xia</title>

    <description>This document defines a mechanism for the setup,reoptimization and recovery of PTP LSP based on the PDV metrics between the 1588 Master and the 1588 Slave.  When a PTP communication path goes through the third party networks (e.g. the MPLS networks), the PDV noise caused by the third party networks will have a significant impact on the synchronization performance.  So, the PDV metrics should be considered in the setup of PTP LSP.  In addition, when the PDV noise exceeds to a certain degree, it is necessary to notify the head-end LSR(i.e. the 1588 Master) to switch to the backup PTP LSP and to reoptimize the primary PTP LSP in order to improve the PTP reliability.</description>
