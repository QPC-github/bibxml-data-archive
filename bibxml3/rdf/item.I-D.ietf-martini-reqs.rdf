    <title>"Requirements for multiple address of record (AOR) reachability information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", John Elwell, Hadriel Kaplan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-martini-reqs-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration mechanism for multiple addresses of record, the mechanism being suitable for deployment by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs). The requirements are for a solution that can, as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.</description>
