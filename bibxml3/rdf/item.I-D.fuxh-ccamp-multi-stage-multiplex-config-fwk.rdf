    <description>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been considered in G.709.  Multi stages multiplexing would be desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to upgrade every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across the 2.5G TS region.  Multi stages multiplexing are also used to support the multi-domain OTN applications based on carrier-Carrier, regional-national core interconnection or network tunnels design. This document describes the framework for multi stages multiplexing configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.</description>
