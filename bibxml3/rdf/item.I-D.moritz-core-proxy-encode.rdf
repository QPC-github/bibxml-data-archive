    <title>"CoAP Proxy Encode-To Option", Guido Moritz</title>

    <description>The scope of this document is to propose a new option to be used in conjunction with the CoAP proxy mechanisms.  Several content types can be converted stateless into each other.  The conversion may result in much more efficient representation of the resource.  But currently no mechanism exists to indicate the proxy to perform the compression.</description>
