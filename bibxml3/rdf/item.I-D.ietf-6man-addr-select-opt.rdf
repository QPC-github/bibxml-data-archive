    <title>"Distributing Address Selection Policy using DHCPv6", Arifumi Matsumoto, Tomohiro Fujisaki, Tim Chown</title>

    <description>RFC 6724 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that allow nodes to select an appropriate address when faced with multiple source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  RFC 6724 allows for the future definition of methods to administratively configure the address selection policy information.  This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site administrator to distribute address selection policy overriding the default address selection parameters and policy table, and thus to control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.</description>
