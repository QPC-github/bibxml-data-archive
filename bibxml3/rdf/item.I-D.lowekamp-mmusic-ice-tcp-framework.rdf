    <title>"A Proposal to Define Interactive Connectivity Establishment for the  Transport Control Protocol (ICE-TCP) as an Extensible Framework", Adam Roach, Bruce Lowekamp</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lowekamp-mmusic-ice-tcp-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>The ICE-TCP mechanism is currently regarded as of limited usefulness due to the low success rate of TCP simultaneous open for NAT traversal.  This document presents a vision of the ICE-TCP document as an extensible framework for negotiating a variety of approaches for establishing a TCP connection between NATed hosts.  This document further proposes significantly extending the current set of collection mechanisms to encompass a wide variety of technologies that are currently available, including UPnP, SOCKS, and Teredo. Because several of these technologies are already widely deployed, the direct connection rate should be significantly higher than using straight TCP alone.  We envision that as future TCP connection establishment techniques are developed, they too will specify an ICE encoding that will allow their negotiation.</description>
