    <title>"Unknown Key Share Attacks on uses of TLS with the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Martin Thomson, Eric Rescorla</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-uks-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).  Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity.  These attacks are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be mislead about the identity of a communicating peer.  Mitigation techniques are defined that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy.</description>
