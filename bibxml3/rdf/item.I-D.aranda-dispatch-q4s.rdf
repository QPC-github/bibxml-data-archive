    <description>This memo describes an application level protocol for the communication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The Quality for Service Protocol (Q4S) provides a mechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth, and packet, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.  Implementation details on the actions to be triggered upon reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out of scope of this document, it is application dependent (e.g., act to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent (e.g., change connection's quality profile).  This protocol specification is the product of research conducted over a number of years, and is presented here as a permanent record and to offer a foundation for future similar work.  It does not represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.</description>
