    <description>Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible to host various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment. The virtual machine hosting technology provides a method to migrate a virtual machine from one hypervisor to another.  However, such a technology is mainly focusing on a migration between hypervisors attached to the same link, and tend not to consider migration over the Internet.
