    <title>"XKMS Provisioning of OATH Shared Secret Keys", Phillip Hallam-Baker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hallambaker-oathxkms-00.pdf</link>
    <description>A means of provisioning OATH shared secret OTP parameters based on the XKMS protocol is described. The techniques used may be extended to support XKMS registration of symmetric keys for other cryptographic protocols. It is hoped that publication of this note will allow others to make use of the same architectural approach as a starting point for future proposals. This work is a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify an algorithm that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe that a common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability commercial and open-source implementations.</description>
