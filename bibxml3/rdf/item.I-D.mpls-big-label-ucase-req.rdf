    <description>This document describes usecases and requirements for MPLS big label. The MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in [RFC 3032], the label value is represented by 20-bit space and support up to 1 million of instances. This proven technology has been widely deployed and worked fine for years. However in certain network deployment scenarios of recent years, the 20-bit MPLS label space is no longer sufficient to support the widespread adoption of network virtualization technologies. In what follows we will describe each of the usecase respectively</description>
