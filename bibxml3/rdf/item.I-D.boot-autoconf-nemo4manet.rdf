    <description>Mobile Ad-hoc Networks could be attached to a fixed infrastructure network, like the Internet.  This document specifies a mechanism for Border Router discovery and utilization.  It provides facilities for choosing the best Border Router, configuring IP addresses needed for using the selected Border Router and providing a path to the selected Border Router.  Seamless transition to alternate Border Routers is provided.  When mobile nodes in the MANET make use of Mobile IP or NEMO (NEtwork MObility), session continuity is provided.  NEMO for  MANET is based on NEMO, which utilizes IPv6 mobility support.  The NEMO basic support protocol can easily be enhanced to support IPv4, which provides IPv4 support by NEMO for MANET.</description>
