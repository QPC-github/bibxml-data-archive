    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for transferring files between a device and servers and managing the system files, specially image and configuration files. In particular, the managed objects can be used for configuration backup/restore and agent upgrade.  Currently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for tranfering or managing files. The purpose of this memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability.</description>
