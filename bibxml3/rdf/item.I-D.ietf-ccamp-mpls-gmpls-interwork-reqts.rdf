    <description>Operation of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering (TE) network as a client network to a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network has enhanced operational capabilities compared to those provided by a co-existent protocol model (i.e., operation of MPLS-TE over an independently managed transport layer).  The GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network, and may itself be a multi-layer network supporting both packet and non-packet technologies. A MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and terminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR). The GMPLS network provides transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP.  This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements for operating MPLS-TE networks over GMPLS networks.  K.Kumaki et al.
