        <description>A set of requirements for active Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) of Service Function Chains (SFCs) in a network is presented in this document.  Based on these requirements, an encapsulation of active OAM messages in SFC and a mechanism to detect and localize defects are described.  This document updates RFC 8300.  Particularly, it updates the definition of O (OAM) bit in the Network Service Header (NSH) (RFC 8300) and defines how an active OAM message is identified in the NSH.</description>
