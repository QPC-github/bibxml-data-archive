    <description>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for Reed- Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 16, that can be used to protect arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.  The Reed-Solomon codes considered have attractive properties, since they offer optimal protection against packet erasures and the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols which can greatly simplify decoding.  However, the price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for instance.</description>
