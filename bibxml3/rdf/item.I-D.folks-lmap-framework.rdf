    <description>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols that coordinate interactions between the components.  The document presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements.  It also defines terminology for LMAP (large-scale measurement platforms). The document is a contribution towards the LMAP working group's milestone.</description>
