    <title>"Security Considerations for Networks Using SRv6", Charles Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-perkins-sr-security-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document identifies various threats to networks employing segment routing over an IPv6 transport.  Segment Routing inherits potential security vulnerabilities from source routing in general, and from label-switching approaches such as MPLS.  The document discusses how common security vulnerabilities may be present in SRv6 networks, depending on the security policies that are imposed.</description>
