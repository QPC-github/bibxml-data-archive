    <description>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g. latency) have become (or are becoming) as (or more) critical to data path selection than other metrics.  This document describes extensions to the BFD protocol, such that network performance information can be gathered in a scalable fashion, and subsequently used (by other protocols) to make path selection decisions. These extensions will also provide granular performance monitoring information.</description>
