    <description>This document describes a few scenarios where PW redundancy is  needed. A set of redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-  PW applications, or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. In  order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW path to  forward to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate the  preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in  the redundancy set as defined in [7].</description>
