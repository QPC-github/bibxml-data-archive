    <description>This memo describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for hardware device identifiers.  A general representation of device identity can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage, or equipment inventories.  A URN-based representation can be easily passed along in any application that needs the information.</description>
