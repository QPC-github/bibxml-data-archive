    <title>"A grammar for Policies in a Generic AAA Environment", Arie Taal</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-aaaarch-generic-policy-06.txt</link>
    <description>In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre- sented. A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) when it is confronted with a specific message type of the AAA protocol. The first part of this document defines the role of a Driving Policy and how it fits into the AAA concept. According to the model presented, the main task of a Driving Policy is to describe which pre-conditions have to be checked before the corresponding actions, needed to fulfill an incoming AAA request, can be called, and how to deal with the post-conditions of these actions. In the second part a grammar is proposed for these Driving Policies accompanied by the necessary comments about the semantics.</description>
