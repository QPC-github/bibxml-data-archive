        <description>Network Virtualization Overlay networks using Ethernet VPN (EVPN) as control plane may use Ingress Replication or PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)-based trees to convey the overlay Broadcast, Unknown unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic.  PIM provides an efficient solution to avoid sending multiple copies of the same packet over the same physical link, however it may not always be deployed in the Network Virtualization Overlay core network.  Ingress Replication avoids the dependency on PIM in the Network Virtualization Overlay network core.  While Ingress Replication provides a simple multicast transport, some Network Virtualization Overlay networks with demanding multicast applications require a more efficient solution without PIM in the core.  This document describes a solution to optimize the efficiency of Ingress Replication trees.</description>
