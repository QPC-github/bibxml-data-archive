    <title>"HTTP Connect - Tunnel Protocol For WebRTC", Andrew Hutton, Justin Uberti, Martin Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hutton-httpbis-connect-protocol-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a mechanism to enable HTTP Clients to provide an indication within a HTTP Connect request as to which protocol will be used within the tunnel established to the Server identified by the target resource.  The tunneled protocol is declared using the Tunnel- Protocol HTTP Request header field.  Label usage relating to the use of HTTP Connect by WebRTC clients (e.g. turn, webrtc) are described in this document.</description>
