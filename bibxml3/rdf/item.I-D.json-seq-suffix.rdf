    <description>Structured Syntax Suffixes for media types allow other media types to build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and registers "json-seq" as a structured syntax suffix for JSON Text Sequences.  Note to Readers  This draft should be discussed on the art mailing list [1].  Online access to all versions and files is available on github [2].</description>
