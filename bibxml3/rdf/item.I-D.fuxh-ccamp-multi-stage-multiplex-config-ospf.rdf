    <description>Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in [MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-REQ] document.  Multi stages multiplexing configuration framework is diefined in [MULTI-STAGES- MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-FRW] document.  They describe some scenarios for the interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS and the multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design.  Multi stages multiplexing is desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to upgrade every node in the network.  So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across the 2.5G TS region.  Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support the multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design.  From the perspective of Management Plane and Control Plane, they must get multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each gateway nodes for path computation.  This document describes the OSPF-TE extension for multi stages multiplexing configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.</description>
