    <title>"Inclusion of Manageability Sections in PCE Working Group Drafts", Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pce-manageability-requirements-11.txt</link>
    <description>It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been retrofitted to protocols after they have been specified, standardized, implemented, or deployed. This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements.  The Operations Area has developed "Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions" (RFC 5706), and those guidelines have been adopted by the PCE Working Group.  Previously, the PCE Working Group used the recommendations contained in this document to guide authors of Internet-Drafts on the contents of "Manageability Considerations" sections in their work. This document is retained for historic reference.</description>
