    <title>"Elliptic Curves for Security", Adam Langley, Mike Hamburg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-cfrg-curves-11.txt</link>
    <description>This memo specifies two elliptic curves over prime fields that offer high practical security in cryptographic applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS).  These curves are intended to operate at the ~128-bit and ~224-bit security level, respectively, and are generated deterministically based on a list of required properties.</description>
