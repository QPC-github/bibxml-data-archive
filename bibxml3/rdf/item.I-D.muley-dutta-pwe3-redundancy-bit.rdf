    <description>This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling of redundant PWs between their termination points. A set of redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications.  In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW path to forward to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate a preferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW in the redundancy set.  In addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE/T-PE nodes to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW/MS-PW path.</description>
