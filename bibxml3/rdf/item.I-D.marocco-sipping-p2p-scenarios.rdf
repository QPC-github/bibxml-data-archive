    <title>"P2P SIP in Disconnected or Limited Connectivity Scenarios", Enrico Marocco</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-marocco-sipping-p2p-scenarios-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a detailed description of some scenarios where SIP Connectivity could be easily achieved only in a peer to peer fashion. Other than identifying use cases where a P2P SIP overlay Network is the only affordable solution, it describes how, under some circumstances, signaling and media communications both to and from public domains can be achieved with P2P SIP. Furthermore, it identifies some additional elements which can be shared by community members or let out by access providers for extending SIP Connectivity to such limited environments.</description>
