    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service to mobile nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobile nodes to be involved in IP mobility management.  In other words, the PMIPv6 can transparently support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e. intra-domain roaming, to mobile nodes.  However, if the mobile nodes move to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes should have additional protocols for the inter-domain roaming although the domains also provide the transparent mobility.  Hence, an inter-domain roaming solution would be needed for providing transparent mobility to mobile nodes that only move around among PMIPv6 domains.  This document specifies the inter-domain roaming controlled by the networks adopting the PMIPv6.</description>
