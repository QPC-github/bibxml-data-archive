    <title>"The topology of service function chaining", Qiao Fu, Joel Halpern, DENG Hui</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fu-sfc-topology-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a deployment topology of Service Function Chaining(SFC).  The topology is in accordance with the SFC architecture in [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture].  Currently, such architecture only includes architectural concepts, principles, and components used in the construction of composite services through deployment of SFCs, without any instruction for the field deployment. It is still difficult to map from the architecture to a real deployment of SFC.  In this document, we propose this topology which will give instructions for the field deployments.  We further propose a VCPE usecase of SFC in the transport network, which explains the details of the deployment topology.</description>
