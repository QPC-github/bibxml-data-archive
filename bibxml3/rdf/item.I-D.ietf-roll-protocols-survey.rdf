    <description>Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart    objects, present difficult constraints: very limited memory, little processing power, and long sleep periods. As most of these devices are battery-powered, energy efficiency is critically important. Wireless link qualities can vary significantly over time, requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology change energy costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks introduces requirements that existing routing protocols may not fully address. Using existing application requirements documents, this document derives a minimal and not exhaustive set of criteria for routing in low-power and lossy networks.  It provides a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to these criteria.  From this survey it examines whether existing and mature IETF protocols can be used without modification in these networks, or whether further work is necessary.  It concludes that no existing IETF protocol meets the requirements of this domain.</description>
