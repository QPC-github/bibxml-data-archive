    <title>"DNS Redirect for Protection from Malware", Tom Creighton, Chris Griffiths, Jason Livingood, Ralf Weber</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-livingood-dns-malwareprotect-02.txt</link>
    <description>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called DNS-based malware protection services deployed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other organizations.  These organizations provide so-called DNS-based malware protection services via their recursive DNS servers.  This document specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where these DNS servers are being utilized to provide a service for end users which blocks domains hosting malicious software, and makes recommendations concerning operation of such a service.</description>
