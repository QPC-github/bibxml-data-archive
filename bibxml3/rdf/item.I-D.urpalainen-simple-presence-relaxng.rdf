    <title>"Combined Presence Schemas Utilizing RELAX NG", Jari Urpalainen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-urpalainen-simple-presence-relaxng-05.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes a batch of Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) and its extension schemas written with the RELAX NG schema language.  Unlike with the current W3C XML Schema language it is possible to write reasonable forwards and backwards compatible presence combination schemas.  These RELAX NG schemas are stricter than the W3C Schemas and thus the instance documents that validate with these schemas follow the intended content model more closely. Especially, these schemas are targeted to actual implementations in order to decrease interoperability problems.</description>
