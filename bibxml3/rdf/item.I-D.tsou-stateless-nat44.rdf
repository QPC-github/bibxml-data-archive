    <description>This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT to the customer-premises equipment (CPE) such that no state information is kept on the central NAT device.  The CPE uses a restricted source port set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4 WAN address.  The NAT device performs only strictly stateless address (not port) translation.</description>
