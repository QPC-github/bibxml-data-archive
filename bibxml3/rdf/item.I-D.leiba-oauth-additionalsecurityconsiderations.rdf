    <title>"OAuth Additional Security Considerations", Barry Leiba</title>

    <description>The Open Authentication Protocol (OAuth) specifies a security protocol that involves significant end-user interaction -- the model is based on having the end-user approve the authorization that is being requested.  That aspect makes the user interaction a part of the security model, and raises additional security considerations beyond those that are typical for client/server protocols.  This document describes those considerations.</description>
