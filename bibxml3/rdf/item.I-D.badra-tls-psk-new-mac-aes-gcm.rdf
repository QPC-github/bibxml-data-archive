    <title>"Pre-Shared Key Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) with  SHA-256/384 and AES Galois Counter Mode", Mohamad Badra</title>

    <description>RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 as their MAC algorithm.  This document describes a set of cipher suites for TLS/DTLS which uses stronger digest algorithms  (i.e., SHA-256 or SHA-384) and another which uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).</description>
