    <description>Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone networks. This document describes a framework of how various IETF protocols are combined to place emergency calls. This includes how these calls are routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the physical location of the caller, while providing the call taker the necessary information to dispatch a first responder to that location. This document explains how location mapping, call identification and end system behavior are combined to allow multimedia emergency calls. It describes at a high level how the pieces (recognizing a call as an emergency call, marking it as such, determining the location of the caller, routing the call based on location) go together, and references the Internet standards that define the details of these mechanisms.</description>
