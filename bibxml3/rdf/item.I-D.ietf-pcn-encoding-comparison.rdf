    <description>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every link in the PCN domain, the overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded.  Egress nodes provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets which allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre- congestion.  The PCN Working Group explored a number of approaches for encoding this pre-congestion information into the IP header.  This document provides details of all those approaches along with an explanation of the constraints that had to be met by any solution.</description>
