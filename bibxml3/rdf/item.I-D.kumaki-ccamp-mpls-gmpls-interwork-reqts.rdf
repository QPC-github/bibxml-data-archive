    <title>"Interworking Requirements to Support operation of MPLS-TE over GMPLS  networks", Kenji Kumaki</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kumaki-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements for operating Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering (TE) networks over Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Operation of an MPLS-TE network as a client network to a GMPLS network has enhanced operational capabilities than provided by a co- existent protocol model (ships in the night). The GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network, and may itself be a multi-layer network supporting both packet and non-packet technologies. A MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and terminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR). The GMPLS network provides transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP. Specification of solutions is out of scope for this document.</description>
