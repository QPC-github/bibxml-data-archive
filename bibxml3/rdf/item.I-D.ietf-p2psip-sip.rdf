    <description>This document defines a SIP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD).  The SIP Usage provides the functionality of a SIP proxy or registrar in a fully-distributed system and includes a lookup service for Address of Records (AORs) stored in the overlay.  It also defines Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) that allow the registrations to map an AOR to a specific node reachable through the overlay.  After such initial contact of a peer, the RELOAD AppAttach method is used to establish a direct connection between nodes through which SIP messages are exchanged.</description>
