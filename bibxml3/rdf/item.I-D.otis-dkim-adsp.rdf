    <title>"DKIM Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP)", Table Contents, Author  Address, Douglas Otis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-otis-dkim-adsp-04.txt</link>
    <description>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) as described in [RFC4871], defines a domain-level authentication framework for email to permit verification of the source and contents of messages.  This document specifies an adjunct mechanism to aid in assessing messages that lack valid DKIM signatures for domains used in the author's address.  It defines a record that can advertise the extent to which a domain signs outgoing mail that is publicly exchanged on SMTP port 25, as described in [RFC2821].  Also, how other hosts can access those records.  Advertisements, defined by this document, may also increase DKIM signature expectations for messages received by Mail User Agents (MUAs) or for messages which might have been exchanged over protocols other than SMTP.  In some circumstances, author domains may wish to have accommodations for protocol failures or for mixed public protocol messaging not to be made.  In addition, DKIM's identity parameters related to the author address are decisive only when a corresponding DKIM key local-part template precludes an author address.  DKIM in conjunction with ADSP is to provide methods for detecting the spoofing of known domains, but not for making strong assertions about the identity of the message author.</description>
