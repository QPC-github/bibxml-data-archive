    <description>This document describes procedures to damp multicast routing state changes and prevent the churn due to the multicast dynamicity at the edge of a network.  The procedures described in this document help avoid uncontrolled control plane load increase on the core routing infrastructure.  New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP unicast route damping principles, but adapted to multicast.  They cover multicast and multicast in VPNs contexts.</description>
