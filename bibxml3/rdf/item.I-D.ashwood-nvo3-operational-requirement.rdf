    <description>This document provides framework and requirements for Network Virtualization over Layer 3 (NVO3) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  This document for the most part gathers requirements from existing IETF drafts and RFCs which have already extensively studied this subject for different data planes and layering.  As a result this draft is high level and broad.  We begin to ask which are truly required for NVO3 and expect the list to be narrowed by the working group as subsequent versions of this draft are created.</description>
