    <title>"Requirements for Morality Sections in Routing Area Drafts", Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-farrel-rtg-morality-requirements-01.txt</link>
    <description>It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper consideration in the design and specification of protocols produced within the Routing Area. This has led to a deline in the moral values within the Internet and attempts to retrofit a suitable moral code to implemented and deployed protocols has been shown to be sub-optimal. This document specifies the requirement for all new Routing Area Internet-Drafts to include a 'Morality Considerations' section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.</description>
