    <title>"Compression of IPsec AH and ESP Headers for 6LoWPAN Networks", Shahid Raza, Simon Duquennoy, GÃ¶ran Selander</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-raza-6lo-ipsec-04.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes the header compression mechanisms for IPsec [RFC4301] based on the encoding scheme standardized in [RFC6282]. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) headers are compressed using Next Header Compression (NHC) defined in [RFC6282]. This document does not invalidate any encoding schemes proposed in 6LoWPAN [RFC6282] but rather complements it with compressed IPsec AH and ESP headers using the free bits in the IPv6 Extension Header encoding. Also, this document does not require any changes in a conventional IPsec host on the Internet; the header compression is applied only at the 6LoWPAN layer and is effective within 6LoWPAN networks.</description>
