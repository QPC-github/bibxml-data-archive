    <title>"Securing LWAPP with DTLS", Scott Kelly, Eric Rescorla</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kelly-capwap-lwapp-dtls-01.txt</link>
    <description>The LWAPP protocol defines interactions between wireless termination points and wireless access controllers. Communications between these components must be secured, and the current specification provides for transport security using proprietary mechanisms which are embedded in the protocol. This document describes an alternative approach which eliminates the embedded security, and instead uses DTLS as a secure, tightly-integrated wrapper.</description>
