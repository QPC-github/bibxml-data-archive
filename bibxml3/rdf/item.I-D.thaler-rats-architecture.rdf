    <title>"Remote Attestation Architecture", Dave Thaler</title>

    <description>In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that one entity (a relying party) requires evidence about the remote peer (and system components [RFC4949] thereof), in order to assess the trustworthiness of the peer.  This document describes an architecture for such remote attestation procedures (RATS), which enable relying parties to decide whether to consider a remote system component trustworthy or not.</description>
