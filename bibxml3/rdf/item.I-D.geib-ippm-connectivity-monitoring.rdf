    <description>Within a Segment Routing domain, segment routed measurement packets can be sent along pre-determined paths.  This enables new kinds of measurements.  Connectivity monitoring allows to supervise the state and performance of a connection or a (sub)path from one or a few central monitoring systems.  This document specifies a suitable type-P connectivity monitoring metric.</description>
