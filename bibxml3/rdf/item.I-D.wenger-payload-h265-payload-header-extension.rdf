    <title>"H.265 Payload Header Extension and Temporal Scalability Support", Stephan Wenger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wenger-payload-h265-payload-header-extension-00.txt</link>
    <description>Proposed are the allocation of a NAL unit type from the "unspecified" set of NAL units of H.265 [HEVC] for the purpose of payload header extensions, a generic syntax for the use of that pseudo NAL unit, and one application for it: the signaling of temporal scalability support information.  Two alternative designs are included.  The content of this draft is intended for incorporation into the H.265 RTP payload [h265-payload].</description>
