    <description>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable object or entity with a name, such as a named data chunk, a device, or a service end.  Different from host-centric connectivity, ICN connects named entities using name-based routing and forwarding.  At the same time, network entities, end devices, and applications have variant demands to verify the integrity and authenticity of these entities through names.  This document proposes a generic naming schema called PID, which supports trust provenance, content lookup, routing, and inter-domain resolution for ICN.  With PID schema, a name consists of three components: principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s).  In this draft, we only illustrate the principle and concept of PID and the functional role of each component, and leave encoding approaches as implementation options.</description>
