    <description>This document specifies an OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV to advertise the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router.  For Point- to-Point (P2P)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to neighbors.  This is useful both from the standpoint of auto- configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving.  The Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management.</description>
