    <title>"The Compressed X.509 Certificate Format", David McGrew, Max Pritikin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pritikin-comp-x509-00.txt</link>
    <description>This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact format for X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between the compact format and standard X.509 encoding.  The translation consists of the lossless compression algorithm DEFLATE with a particular predefined dictionary.  Protocol bindings for TLS and IKE are designated.  This format is useful in a constrained environment, where bandwidth and/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability with standards-compliant X.509 certificates and the systems for certificate processing, issuance, and management.</description>
