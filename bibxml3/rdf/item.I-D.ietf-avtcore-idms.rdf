    <description>This document defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Packet Type and an RTCP Extended Report (XR) Block Type to be used for achieving Inter-Destination Media Synchronization (IDMS).  IDMS is the process of synchronizing playout across multiple geographically distributed media receivers.  Using the RTCP XR IDMS Report Block defined in this document, media playout information from participants in a synchronization group can be collected.  Based on the collected information, an RTCP IDMS Settings Packet can then be sent to distribute a common target playout point to which all the distributed receivers, sharing a media experience, can synchronize.  Typical use cases in which IDMS is useful are social TV, shared service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically separated users are watching a media stream together), distance learning, networked video walls, networked loudspeakers, etc.</description>
