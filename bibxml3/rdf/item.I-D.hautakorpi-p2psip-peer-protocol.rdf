    <title>"The Peer Protocol for P2PSIP Networks", Jani Hautakorpi, Gonzalo Camarillo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hautakorpi-p2psip-peer-protocol-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the P2PSIP Peer Protocol that is used between the peers in P2PSIP networks. The described Peer Protocol is not an entirely new protocol, it is a combination of the new SIP method, LOCSER, and the well-defined, XML-based body. Note: At the current moment, the purpose of this document is just to present a relatively high level abstraction from the Peer Protocol, rather than give a very detailed description.</description>
