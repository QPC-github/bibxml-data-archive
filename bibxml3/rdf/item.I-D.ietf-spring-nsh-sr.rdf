        <title>"Integration of Network Service Header (NSH) and Segment Routing for Service Function Chaining (SFC)", Jim Guichard, Jeff Tantsura</title>

        <description>This document describes the integration of the Network Service Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to support Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation of the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.  Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for steering packets between Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH has the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata.  This integration demonstrates that NSH and SR can work cooperatively and provide a network operator with the flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas of their network infrastructure while still maintaining an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</description>
