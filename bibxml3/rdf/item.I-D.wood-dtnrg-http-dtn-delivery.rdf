    <title>"Using HTTP for delivery in Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networks", Lloyd Wood, Peter Holliday</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wood-dtnrg-http-dtn-delivery-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, for communication across delay- and disruption-tolerant networks, by making every transit node in the network HTTP-capable, and doing peer HTTP transfers between nodes to move data hop-by-hop or subnet-by-subnet towards its final destination.  HTTP is well- known and straightforward to implement in these networks.</description>
