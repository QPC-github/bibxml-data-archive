    <description>This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast traffic to MN (Mobile Node). An approach named Mobile IPv6 Multicast with Dynamic Multicast Agent is proposed which combines Movement Based Method [2] and Distance Based Method [3], Such a design allows MN to optimize multicast route, and meanwhile reduce the handoff frequency by selecting new multicast agent dynamically. In addition to weakening the triangle route problem and diminishing the influence of handoff to multicast, this approach provides global mobility in Internet without limitations on network topology. This draft is the same as the earlier version, it is just an update of it.</description>
