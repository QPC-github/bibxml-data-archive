    <title>"Improving the caching DNS resolvers on "authority failure"", Yan Wang, XiaoDong Lee, Sean Shen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wang-improve-dns-resolver-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers. When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and the request can't be found in the cache, during a period of time the caching DNS resolvers won't query the authoritative name servers, but directly return a SERVFAIL to the clients to reduce the recursive name server load and the network load.</description>
