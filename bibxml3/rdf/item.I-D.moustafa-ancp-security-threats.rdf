    <title>"Security Threats and Security Requirements for the Access Node Control  Protocol (ANCP)", Hasnaa Moustafa</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moustafa-ancp-security-threats-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate QoS-, service- and subscriber-related operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)). The main goal of this protocol is to configure and manage access equipments and allow them to report information to the NAS in order to enable and optimize configuration. This document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter, developing a threat model for ANCP security aiming to decide which security functions are required at the ANCP level. Based on this, security requirements regarding the Access Node Control Protocol are defined.</description>
