    <description>This document shares problem statements of the routing of optical Label Switched Paths(LSPs) over network elements with blocking switch architecture in fiber port selectivity. Also, this document provides a direction of solution to take into account the switching constraint within the scope of GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) over network elements with blocking switch architecture in fiber port selectivity in addition to wavelength selectivity.</description>
