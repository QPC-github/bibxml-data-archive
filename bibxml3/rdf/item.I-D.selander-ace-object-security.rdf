    <title>"Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP)", Goeran Selander, John Mattsson, Francesca Palombini, Ludwig Seitz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-selander-ace-object-security-06.txt</link>
    <description>This memo defines Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP), a method for application layer protection of message exchanges with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), using the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) format.  OSCOAP provides end-to-end encryption, integrity and replay protection to CoAP payload, options, and header fields, as well as a secure binding between CoAP request and response messages.  The use of OSCOAP is signaled with the CoAP option Object-Security, also defined in this memo.</description>
