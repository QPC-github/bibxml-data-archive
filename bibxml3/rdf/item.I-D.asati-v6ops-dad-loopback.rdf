    <description>It is a common practice to install a (soft or hard) loopback on a circuit interface for various purposes (e.g. circuit turn-up test). However, this practice results in disabling IPv6 on an interface even after the loopback is removed, due to the way IPv6 duplicate address detection is performed.  This document describes a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after such a loopback is placed &amp; removed.</description>
