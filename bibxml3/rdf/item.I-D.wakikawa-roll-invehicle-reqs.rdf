    <description>This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle low power and lossy networks.  Automobiles are already equipped with several sensors and devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for controlling, monitoring and entertainment, etc.  For the future in- vehicle networks, the shift to wireless is desirable due to heavy weight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able to efficiently install devices.  However, with the limitation of low power, in- vehicle network still requires reliability and scalability in nature of the rolls of ECU.  The routing protocol should support the features of low-power, high-reliability, Subnetting, QoS, Mobility, etc.  This document briefly explains the in-vehicle networks and ECUs, then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in- vehicle networks.</description>
