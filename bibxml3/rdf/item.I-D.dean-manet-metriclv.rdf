    <title>"Representing metric values in MANETs", Justin Dean</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dean-manet-metriclv-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines TLVs (type-length-value) structures for representing cost values using the generalized MANET packet/message format.  A message block TLV structure is defined for representing a cost value associated with the local node.  An address block TLV structure is defined for representing a cost value associated with links or a cost value associated with other nodes.  Both TLV structures are defined for use within MANET protocols.  Registry space is created for TLVs which follow this format.</description>
