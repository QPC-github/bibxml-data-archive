    <title>"Shim6 Reachability Detection", Iljitsch van Beijnum</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-van-beijnum-shim6-reach-detect-00.txt</link>
    <description>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows multihoming by using multiple addresses. When communication between the initially chosen addresses for a transport session is no longer possible, a "shim" layer makes it possible to switch to a different set of addresses without breaking current transport protocol assumptions. This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currently used address pair between two hosts ("current pair reachability") and and picking a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs ("full path exploration").</description>
