    <description>This memo describes a home network prefix and address assignment algorithm running on top of any 'flooding protocol' that fulfills the specified requirements.  It is expected that home border routers are allocated one or multiple IPv6 prefixes through DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) or that prefixes are made available through other means.  An IPv4 address can also be assigned and private addresses be used with NAT to provide IPv4 connectivity.  In both cases, provided prefixes need to be efficiently divided among the multiple links, and routers need to obtain addresses.  This document describes a distributed algorithm for IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes division, assignment and router's address assignment, and specifies how hosts can be given addresses and configuration options using DHCP or SLAAC.</description>
