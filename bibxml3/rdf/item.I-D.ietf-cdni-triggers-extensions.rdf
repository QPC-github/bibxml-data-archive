        <description>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document defines extensions to the Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Control Interface/Triggers defined in RFC 8007.  These extensions are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching architecture but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</description>
