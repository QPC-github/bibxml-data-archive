    <title>"Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) SCSI Features Update", Frederick Knight, Mallikarjun Chadalapaka</title>

    <description>Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol as specified in RFCxxx (and as previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC 5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) version of the SCSI family of protocols. This document defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5.  This document is a companion document to RFCxxx.  -------------------------------------------------------- RFC EDITORS NOTE: The above two references to RFCxxx should reference the RFC number assigned to the draft-ietf-storm- iscsi-cons-xx document, and this note should be removed. --------------------------------------------------------</description>
