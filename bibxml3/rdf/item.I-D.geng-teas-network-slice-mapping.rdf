        <description>Network Slicing is one of the core features in 5G.  End-to-end network slice consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access Network (AN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN). This draft describes the procedure of mapping 5G end-to-end network slice to transport network slice defined in IETF.  This draft also intends to expose some gaps in the existing network management plane and data plane technologies to support inter-domain network slice mapping.  Further work may require collaboration between IETF and 3GPP (or other standard organizations).  Data model specification, signaling protocol extension and new encapsulation definition are out of the scope of this draft.</description>
