    <title>"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Call Flow Examples with PASSporT Diversion and History-Info", Mary Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-stir-passport-div-hi-callflows-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document focuses on use cases and call flows which include the History-Info header field and a SIP Identity header field with a PASSport with a "div" claim in cases of retargeting.  These use cases are derived from those provided in the SIP History-Info call flows document.  The objective is to describe the optimal way to correlate the History-Info header fields with a PASSporT with diversion information to increase the level of confidence in the History-Info header field by the terminating entity making use of the information.</description>
