    <title>"Deprecate DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos", Love Astrand, Tom Yu</title>

    <description>The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified in RFC1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption.  Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established consensus that DES is insufficiently secure.  By 2008, commercial hardware costing less than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average. DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly, this document updates RFC1964, RFC4120, RFC4121, and RFC4757 to deprecate the use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos.  Because RFC1510 (obsoleted by RFC4120) supports only DES, this document reclassifies RFC1510 as Historic.</description>
