    <description>Failure protection is desirable for multicast traffic, whether signaled via PIM or mLDP.  Different mechanisms are suitable for different use-cases and deployment scenarios.  This document describes the architecture for global protection (aka multicast live- live) and for local protection (aka fast-reroute).  The general methods for global protection and local protection using alternate-trees are dependent upon the use of Maximally Redundant Trees.  Local protection can also tunnel traffic in unicast tunnels to take advantage of the routing and fast-reroute mechanisms available for IP/LDP unicast destinations.  The failures protected against are single link or node failures. While the basic architecture might support protection against shared risk group failures, algorithms to dynamically compute MRTs supporting this are for future study.</description>
