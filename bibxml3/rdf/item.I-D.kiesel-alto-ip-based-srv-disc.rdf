    <description>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.  Terminology and Requirements Language  This document makes use of the ALTO terminology defined in RFC 5693 [RFC5693].</description>
