    <title>"Protecting The Router Control Plane", David Dugal, Carlos Pignataro, Rodney Dunn</title>

    <description>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all legitimate control plane traffic is identifed.  Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed on the router's forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.</description>
