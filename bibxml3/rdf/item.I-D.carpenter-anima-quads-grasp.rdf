    <title>"Quick and Dirty Secure Autonomic Control Plane for GRASP", Brian Carpenter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-carpenter-anima-quads-grasp-03.txt</link>
    <description>A secure substrate known as the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) is required by the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) used by Autonomic Service Agents.  This document describes QUADS, a QUick And Dirty Secure ACP using symmetric cryptography and preconfigured keys or passwords.  It also describes a simplistic QUADS Key Infrastructure based on asymmetric cryptography used over insecure instances of GRASP to create a QUADS ACP.</description>
