    <title>"Guidelines for a sender-based TFRC", Guillaume Jourjon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jourjon-tsvwg-sender-based-tfrc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo introduces the specification of a TFRC sender-based protocol. This protocol is based on TFRC [2] congestion control and SACK [1] mechanism. It enlights TFRC processing for the receiver and provides a robust architecture against selfish receiver behavior. This protocol remains compliant to the common TFRC as defined in [2].</description>
