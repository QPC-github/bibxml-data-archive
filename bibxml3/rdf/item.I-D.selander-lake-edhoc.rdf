    <title>"Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)", Goeran Selander, John Mattsson, Francesca Palombini</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-selander-lake-edhoc-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), a very compact, and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange with ephemeral keys.  EDHOC provides mutual authentication, perfect forward secrecy, and identity protection.  EDHOC is intended for usage in constrained scenarios and a main use case is to establish an OSCORE security context.  By reusing COSE for cryptography, CBOR for encoding, and CoAP for transport, the additional code footprint can be kept very low.</description>
