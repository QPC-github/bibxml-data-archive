    <description>This document describes an architecture of the I2NSF framework using security function chaining for security policy enforcement.  Security function chaining enables composite inspection of network traffic by steering the traffic through multiple types of network security functions according to the information model for NSFs capabilities in the I2NSF framework.  This document explains the additional components integrated into the I2NSF framework and their functionalities to achieve security function chaining.  It also describes representative use cases to address major benefits from the proposed architecture.</description>
