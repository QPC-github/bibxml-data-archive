    <title>"Specification of a Provider-Managed Adaptive Function Between a Multicast Receiver and a Provider Network Supporting a Different IP Version", Cathy Zhou, Tom Taylor, Jianping Sun</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zhou-multrans-af1-specification-01.txt</link>
    <description>Discussion of the problem of multicast transition has brought out a number of scenarios that are the most likely to be encountered in practice.  In some of these scenarios the IP version supported by the multicast receiver differs from that supported by the provider network to which it is attached.  In such cases an adaptation function is required between the receiver and the network, to mediate the signalling and data flows between them.  This memo uses the term "Type 1 Adaptation Function" (AF1) for such a function.  It is written for the purpose of specifying the functions performed by an AF1.  The scope of this memo is limited to the case where flows are unidirectional, from a designated set of sources to a designated (and normally much more numerous) set of receivers.  The IP television (IPTV) case falls within this scope.</description>
