        <description>Mobility support is an important network capability for mobile node, and 5G introduces the Mobility Pattern used by the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) to optimize mobility support provided to the UE.  More specific, The AMF determines and updates Mobility Pattern of the UE according to the subscription of the UE, statistics of the UE mobility, network local policy, and the UE assisted information, or any combination of them with the help of NWDAF.  Based on different requirements, multiple mobility management protocols have been developed under IPv6.  However, different protocols have different functional requirements on the network element or the host and then a scheme should be used in order to support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management protocol when a host (or UE) accesses to a new network.  In this draft, this issue is analyzed.</description>
