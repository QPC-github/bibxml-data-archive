        <description>Based on different requirements, multiple mobility management protocols have been developed.  Different protocols have different functional requirements on the network element or the host and then a scheme should be used in order to support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management protocol when a host accesses to a new network.  In this draft, this issue is analyzed.</description>
