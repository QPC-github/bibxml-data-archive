    <title>"Actions addressing identified issues with the Session Initiation Protocol's  non-INVITE Transaction", Robert Sparks</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sparks-sip-nit-actions-03.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes modifications to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the SIP non-INVITE transaction. These modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition inherent in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic. They also improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding. These changes update behavior defined in RFCs 3261.</description>
