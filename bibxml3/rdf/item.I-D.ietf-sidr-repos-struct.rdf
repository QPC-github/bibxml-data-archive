    <title>"A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure", Geoff Huston, Robert Loomans, George Michaelson</title>

    <description>This document defines a profile for the structure of the Resource PKI distributed repository.  Each individual repository publication point is a directory that contains files that correspond to X.509 / PKIX Resource Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed objects.  This profile defines the object (file) naming scheme, the contents of repository publication points (directories), and a suggested internal structure of a local repository cache that is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed collection of repository publication points and to facilitate certification path construction.</description>
