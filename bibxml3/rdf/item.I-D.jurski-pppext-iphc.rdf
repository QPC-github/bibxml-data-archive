    <title>"Limited IP Header Compression over PPP", Janusz Jurski</title>

    <description>The negotiation options specified in RFC 2509 defined an all-or-nothing strategy for applying header compression: peers were assumed to support compression for any combination of headers. [RFC3544] refined that strategy to make it possible to negotiate header compression for only TCP or only non-TCP packets (and also added Enhanced RTP-Compression negotiation option).  The current document further refines the strategy by also making it possible to negotiate header compression for only particular combinations of headers or header types.</description>
