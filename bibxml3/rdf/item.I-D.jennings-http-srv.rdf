    <title>"DNS SRV Records for HTTP", Cullen Jennings</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jennings-http-srv-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses a DNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server.  The http+srv scheme operates in the same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS lookup that a http scheme would use, it first tries an DNS SRV lookup.  This memo also defines a https+srv scheme that operates in the same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.  The draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.</description>
