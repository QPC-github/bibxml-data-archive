    <title>"Specification of the IPFIX Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow  Information", Benoit Claise</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ipfix-protocol-26.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies the IPFIX protocol that serves for transmitting IP traffic flow information over the network. In order to transmit IP traffic flow information from an exporting process to an information collecting process, a common representation of flow data and a standard means of communicating them is required. This document describes how the IPFIX data and templates records are carried over a number of transport protocols from an IPFIX exporting process to an IPFIX collecting process.</description>
