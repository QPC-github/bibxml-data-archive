    <title>"Multihoming L3 Shim Approach", Erik Nordmark, Marcelo Bagnulo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nordmark-multi6dt-shim-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document outlines an approach to solving IPv6 multihoming in order to stimulate discussion. The approach is based on using a multi6 shim placed between the IP endpoint sublayer and the IP routing sublayer, and, at least initially, using routable IP locators as the identifiers visible above the shim layer. The approach does not introduce a "stack name" type of identifier, instead it ensures that all upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing a stable IPv6 address. This document does not specify the mechanism for authenticating and authorizing the "rehoming" - this is specified in the HBA document. Nor does it specify the messages used to establish multihoming state. The document does not even specify the packet format used for the data packets. Instead it discusses the issue of receive side demultiplexing and the different tradeoffs. The resolution of this issue will effect the packet format for the data packets.</description>
