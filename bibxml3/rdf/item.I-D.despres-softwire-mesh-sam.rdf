    <title>"Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) - Mesh Softwires without e-BGP", Remi Despres</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-despres-softwire-mesh-sam-01.txt</link>
    <description>SAM is a generic and simple mechanism for packets having addresses in a family IPvX to traverse routing domains where this address family is not directly routed. SAM topological scenarios are those of Mesh Softwire, i.e. with point to multipoint tunnels between border nodes of interior routing domains.  In the mesh-softwire context, SAM differs from RFC 5565 in that SAM uses no protocol between border nodes of the domain, and in that customer border nodes don't need to maintain states for all other border nodes.  (RFC 5565 is based on an Exterior Border-Gateway Protocol e-BGP between border nodes, with dynamic routing tables to be maintained in all of them).  SAM's address mappings are stateless, based on only a few domain parameters.  SAM is thus suitable to small to medium enterprises, and small to medium ISPs, that cannot afford e-BGP in all their border nodes.  All combinations of IPv4 and IPv6, global or private, are supported.  Also, to mitigate consequences of the IPv4 address shortage, SAM supports port-extended IPv4 addresses (A+P).</description>
