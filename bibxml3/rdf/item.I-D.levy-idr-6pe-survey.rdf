    <title>"Connecting IPv6 Islands over IPv4 MPLS using IPv6 Provider Edge Routers  (6PE)", Eric Levy-Abegnoli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-levy-idr-6pe-survey-00.txt</link>
    <description>[6PE] specifies a mechanism to interconnect IPv6 islands over an MPLS-enabled IPv4 cloud using the IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE) approach. The present document reports the results of an implementation survey for this mechanism. After a brief summary of the results, each survey response is listed. The document contains responses from the five implementers that completed the survey (Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Ixia, Agilent, Spirent). The document also reports some basic interoperability testing of 6PE implementations carried out by ISOCORE. No ambiguities or errors in the [6PE] specification which could compromise interoperability have been reported.</description>
