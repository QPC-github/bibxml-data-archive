    <description>Continuity Check (CC), Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) and Remote Defect Indication (RDI) functionalities required for are MPLS- TP OAM.  Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the path for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors the integrity of the routing of the path between sink and source for any connectivity issues. RDI enables an End Point to report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on a PW, LSP or Section.  This document specifies methods for proactive CV, CC, and RDI for MPLS-TP Label Switched Path (LSP), PWs and Sections using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).</description>
