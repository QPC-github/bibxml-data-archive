    <title>"DHCPv4 Behavior over IP-IP tunnel", Yong Cui, Peng Wu, Jianping Wu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cui-softwire-dhcp-over-tunnel-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document analyzes the scenario in which DHCPv4 interaction is performed over IP-IP tunnel, and proposes methods to keep DHCP working under such situation.  The main issue is encapsulation of DHCP packets on server side, and there are both in-protocol and out- of-protocol solutions for this issue.  The in-protocol solution is to have DHCP carrying the encapsulation address information, and the out-of-protocol solution is to have the DHCP server keeping track of the address mapping by inspecting DHCP packets.</description>
