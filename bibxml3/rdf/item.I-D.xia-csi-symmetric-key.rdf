    <description>In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from the router to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND) signaling between the router and the host.  The host sends a Router Solicitation(RS) message with ND Shared Key Request Option to the router.  The router encrypts a ND shared key using the host's SEcure Neighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it back to the host through a Router Advertisement(RA) message.  The host decrypts the ND shared key using the matching private key.  The Neighbor Discovery shared key is then used for protecting the following Neighbor Discovery signaling between the router and the host.  The Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement message exchanges are required to have SEND security.</description>
