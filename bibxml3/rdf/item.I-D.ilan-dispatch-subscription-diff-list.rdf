    <title>"Subscription to Differntial Resource lists in SIP Presence Event Notification model", N Ilankumaran, Gopalakrishnan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ilan-dispatch-subscription-diff-list-01.txt</link>
    <description>SIP SIMPLE work group has defined several improvements to SIP Presence event notification model, such as subscription to a list of resources in the body of single SUBSCRIBE request, and Resource List Server (RLS) to create subscription to resource list identified by a URI. This document presents an extension to incrementally update resource list contained in the body of subscription requests for SIP presence. The document defines semantics for creating incremental changes to resource list that are carried in requests for subscription refreshes. This enables reduction in the number of messages exchanged for subscriptions in large network of inter- connected SIP based presence servers.</description>
