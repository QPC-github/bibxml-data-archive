    <title>"A Threat Model for Pervasive Passive Surveillance", Brian Trammell, Daniel Borkmann, Christian Huitema</title>

    <description>This document elaborates a threat model for pervasive surveillance. We assume an adversary with an interest in indiscriminate eavesdropping that can passively observe network traffic at every layer at every point in the network between the endpoints.  It is intended to demonstrate to protocol designers and implementors the observability and inferability of information and metainformation transported over their respective protocols, to assist in the evaluation of the performance of these protocols and the effectiveness of their protection mechanisms under pervasive passive surveillance.</description>
