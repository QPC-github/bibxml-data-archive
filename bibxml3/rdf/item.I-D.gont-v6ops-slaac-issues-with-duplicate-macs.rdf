    <description>Traditional Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) typically involves producing a Modified-EU64 format identifier to be employed as the Interface-ID of the resulting address.  In the case of Ethernet network interface cards, such identifier derived from the corresponding IEEE 802 address.  IEEE 802 addresses are generally expected to be globally unique, thus resulting in non-duplicate addresses.  However, in many real-world scenarios, these identifiers fail to be unique, thus resulting in duplicate IPv6 addresses.  This document discusses the interoperability problems arising from duplicate IEEE 802 addresses with IPv6 Stateless Address Auto- Configuration (SLAAC), and how some popular implementations react when the such problems arise.  Finally, it discusses possible mitigations for the aforementioned issue.</description>
