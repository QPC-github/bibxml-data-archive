    <description>This document specifies a mechanism to establish Security Associations (SAs) between Access Nodes in the handover keying architecture. The proposed mechanism negotiates the SA with the help of existing SAs between Access Nodes and Access Domain Controller, and between Access Domain Controller and AAA server as well.</description>
