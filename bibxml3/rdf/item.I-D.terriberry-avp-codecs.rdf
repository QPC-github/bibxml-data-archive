    <title>"Update to Recommended Codecs for the AVP RTP Profile", Timothy Terriberry</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-terriberry-avp-codecs-00.txt</link>
    <description>[RFC3551] defines the AVP RTP profile, which is the basis for many other profiles, such as SAVP [RFC3711], AVPF [RFC4585], and SAVPF [RFC5124].  This document updates [RFC3551] (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage since the document was originally published.</description>
