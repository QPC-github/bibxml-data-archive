    <title>"Cryptographic Token Key Initialization Protocol (CT-KIP) Version 1.0  Revision 1", Magnus Nystrom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nystrom-ct-kip-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document constitutes Revision 1 of CT-KIP Version 1.0 from RSA Laboratories' One-Time Password Specifications (OTPS) series. The body of this document, except for the intellectual property considerations section and the IANA considerations section, is taken from the CT-KIP Version 1.0 document, but comments received during the IETF review are reflected; hence the status of a revised version. As no "bits-on-the-wire" have changed, the protocol specified herein is compatible with CT-KIP Version 1.0. CT-KIP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of cryptographic tokens. The protocol requires neither private-key capabilities in the cryptographic tokens, nor an established public-key infrastructure. Provisioned (or generated) secrets will only be available to the server and the cryptographic token itself.</description>
