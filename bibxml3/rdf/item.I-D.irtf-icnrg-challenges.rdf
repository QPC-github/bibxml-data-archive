    <description>This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric Networking (ICN), an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support information distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling or enhancing a number of desirable features, such as security, user-mobility, multicast and in-network caching. Mechanisms for realizing these benefits is subject of on-going research in the IRTF and elsewhere.  This document describes current research challenges in ICN, including naming, security, routing, system scalability, mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-network caching, and network management.  This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</description>
