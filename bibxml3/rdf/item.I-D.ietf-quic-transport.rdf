        <description>This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration.  QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm.  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC  DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This version is still a work in progress.  For trial deployments, please use earlier versions.  Note to Readers  Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group mailing list (quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org)), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic  Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg; source code and issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-transport.</description>
