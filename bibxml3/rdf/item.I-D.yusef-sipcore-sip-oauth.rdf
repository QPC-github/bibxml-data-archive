    <title>"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) OAuth", Rifaat Shekh-Yusef, Victor Pascual, Christer Holmberg</title>

    <description>This document defines an authorization framework for SIP that is based on the OAuth 2.0 framework, and adds a simple identity layer on top of that, based on the OpenID Connect Core 1.0, to enable Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User.</description>
