    <title>"Extensible Message Application Interchange Language (EMAIL) -- Part Four:  Message/List Registration", Bruce Lilly</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lilly-extensible-internet-message-format-p04-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561 has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed difficulties for some desirable operations such as digitally signed messages, have led to clutter in message content which in turn has led user agent implementers to suppress display of some originator message content, leading in some cases to user confusion, surprise, and embarrassment. This memo is part of a multi-document series that specifies an extensible message format which is intended to facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format and to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content. This memo defines and provides registration information for a media type for conveying mailing list information in the extensible message format.</description>
