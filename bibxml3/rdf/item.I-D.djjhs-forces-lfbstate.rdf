    <title>"ForCES LFB Instance State", Damascane Joachimpillai, Jamal Hadi Salim</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-djjhs-forces-lfbstate-00.txt</link>
    <description>The ForCES LFB Topology currently defines that once an instance of an LFB class is created it becomes immediately active in the datatapath. This document makes a slight extension to add state to an instantiated LFB class allowing the CE to decide when an LFB instance becomes operational on the datapath.</description>
