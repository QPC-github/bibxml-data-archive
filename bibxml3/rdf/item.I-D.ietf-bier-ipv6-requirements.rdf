    <description>There have been several proposed solutions with BIER being used in IPv6.  But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and lists the requirements.  The goal of this document is to describe the general BIER IPv6 encapsulation problem and detail solution requirements, thereby assisting the working group in the development of acceptable solutions.</description>
