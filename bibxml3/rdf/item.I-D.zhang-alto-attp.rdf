    <description>Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic. This document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by setting cooperative ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network.  Through improving the random node selection mechanism in P2P  tracker-based application, we can effectively reduce cross-ISP  traffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network  operation.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.</description>
