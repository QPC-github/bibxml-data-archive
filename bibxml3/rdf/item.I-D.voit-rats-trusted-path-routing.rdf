    <description>There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like IPSec alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly sensitive traffic flows.  These end-users want their flows to traverse devices which have been freshly appraised and verified. This specification describes Trusted Path Routing.  Trusted Path Routing protects sensitive flows as they transit a network by forwarding traffic to/from sensitive subnets across network devices recently appraised as trustworthy.</description>
