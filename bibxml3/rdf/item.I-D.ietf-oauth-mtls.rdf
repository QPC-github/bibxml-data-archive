    <title>"OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens", Brian Campbell, John Bradley, Nat Sakimura, Torsten Lodderstedt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-17.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes OAuth client authentication and certificate- bound access and refresh tokens using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication with X.509 certificates.  OAuth clients are provided a mechanism for authentication to the authorization server using mutual TLS, based on either self-signed certificates or public key infrastructure (PKI).  OAuth authorization servers are provided a mechanism for binding access tokens to a client's mutual-TLS certificate, and OAuth protected resources are provided a method for ensuring that such an access token presented to it was issued to the client presenting the token.</description>
