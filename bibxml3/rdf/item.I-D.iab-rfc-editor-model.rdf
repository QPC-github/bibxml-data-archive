    <title>"RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", Olaf Kolkman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-rfc-editor-model-07.txt</link>
    <description>The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Series Editor, the Independent Submission Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  It also introduces the RFC Series Advisory Group and an (optional) Independent Submission Stream Editorial Board.  The model outlined here is intended to increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.</description>
