    <description>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular encapsulation tunnel technology.  When a node tries to encapsulate the user traffic in GRE, it needs the IP address of the destination node which decapsulates the GRE packets.  In practice, the GRE tunnel destination IP addresses are mainly configured manually.  This configuration mechanism causes efficiency issues for operators.  This document proposes an approach to configure the GRE information dynamically.</description>
