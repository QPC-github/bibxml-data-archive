    <description>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support the automount database.  The automount database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510].  An automount database contains information about file system mount- points that are to be mapped by the automounter.  This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis- mapping-00] for the automount database, and database entries referenced by those maps.</description>
