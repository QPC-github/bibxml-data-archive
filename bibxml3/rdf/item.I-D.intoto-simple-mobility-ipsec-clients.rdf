    <description>One very popular use of VPNs is to provide telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet. Remote clients that are behind NAT boxes can also access the corporate intranet with the help of the standard NAT Traversal feature.  But this access may be disturbed in scenarios where a mobile user roams across different points of attachment and there by getting assigned with different IP Addresses. The access also fails in cases where the client roams across environments with NAT to environments without NAT and vice versa. In both the cases the tunnel may get re-established but it induces jitter in voice sessions.</description>
