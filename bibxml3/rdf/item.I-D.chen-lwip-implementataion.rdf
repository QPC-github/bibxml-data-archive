    <description>Since small devices such as sensors are often required to be physically small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internet protocols will have to deal with having limited computing resources and memory.  This report describes the design and implementation of a small TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small enough to be used in minimal systems.</description>
