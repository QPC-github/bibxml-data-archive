        <description>Today's transport protocols offer a variety of functionality based on the notion that the network is to be treated as an unreliable communication medium.  Some, like TCP, establish a reliable connection on top of the unreliable network while others, like UDP, simply transmit datagrams without a connection and without guarantees into the network.  These fundamental differences in functionality have a significant impact on how COIN approaches can be designed and implemented.  Furthermore, traditional transport protocols are not designed for the multi-party communication principles that underlie many COIN approaches.  This document raises several questions regarding the use of transport protocols in connection with COIN.</description>
