    <title>"Protocol for Protecting Movement of Mobile Nodes in Mobile IPv6", Ying Qiu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-qiu-mip6-mnprivacy-00.txt</link>
    <description>When a mobile node roams, its location information can be revealed by monitoring the IP addresses in its IP packets. This document proposes a technique for hiding a mobile node's care-of adress from its correspondent node and its home address from an eavesdropper using reverse tunelling. It also proposes another technique for preventing movement tracing of a mobile node by an eavesdropper during route optimization.</description>
