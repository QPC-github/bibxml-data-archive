        <description>TLS session tickets enable stateless connection resumption for clients without server-side, per-client, state.  Servers vend an arbitrary number of session tickets to clients, at their discretion, upon connection establishment.  Clients store and use tickets when resuming future connections.  This document describes a mechanism by which clients can specify the desired number of tickets needed for future connections.  This extension aims to provide a means for servers to determine the number of tickets to generate in order to reduce ticket waste, while simultaneously priming clients for future connection attempts.</description>
