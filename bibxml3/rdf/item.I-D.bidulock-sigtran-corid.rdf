    <title>"Correlation Id and Hearbeat Procedures (CORID) Supporting Lossless Fail-Over  between SCTP Associations for Signalling User Adaptation Layers", Brian Bidulock</title>

    <description>This Internet-Draft describes Correlation Id and Heartbeat procedures to support lossless fail-over between SCTP [SCTP] associations for SS7 [Q.700] Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA] supporting the concept of a Routing Context or Interface Identifier. These procedures permit lossless fail-over between Application Server Processes (ASPs) at a Signalling Gateway (SG) and fail-over between Signalling Gateway Processes (SGPs) and Signalling Gateways (SGs) at an Application Server Process (ASP). Lossless fail-over permits these fail-overs to occur without loss or duplication of UA-User messages.</description>
