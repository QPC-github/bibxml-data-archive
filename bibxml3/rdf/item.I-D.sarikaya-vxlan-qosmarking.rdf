    <description>The Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network enables multiple tenants to operate in a data center.  Each tenant needs to be assigned a priority group to prioritize their traffic.  Cloud carriers wish to use quality of service to differentiate different applications.  For these purposes, three bits are assigned in the eXtensible Local Area Network header.  How these bits are assigned and are processed in the network are explained in detail.</description>
