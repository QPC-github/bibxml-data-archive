    <title>"A generic control stream for Multipath TCP", Christoph Paasch, Olivier Bonaventure</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-paasch-mptcp-control-stream-00.pdf</link>
    <description>Multipath TCP's extensive use of TCP options to exchange control information consumes a significant part of the TCP option space. Extending MPTCP to add more control information into the session becomes cumbersome as the TCP option space is limited to 40 bytes.  This draft introduces a control stream that allows to send control information as part of the subflow's payload.  The control stream is mapped into a separate sequence number space and uses a TLV-format for maximum extensibility.  It is left to future documents to specify how the TLV-format might be used to exchange control information.  As the control stream is sent as part of the subflow's payload, it is not subject to the 40 bytes limitation of the TCP option space.</description>
