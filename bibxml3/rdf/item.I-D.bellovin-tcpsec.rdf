    <title>"Problem Statement and Requirements for a TCP Authentication Option", Steven  Bellovin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bellovin-tcpsec-01.txt</link>
    <description>The TCP-MD5 option is commonly used to secure BGP sessions between routers, although it is known to have many serious deficiencies. This memo presents requirements for a TCP segment authentication mechanism that is intended to replace TCP-MD5. While TCP-MD5 was designed to protect TCP sessions whose payload is BGP, the applicability of the mechanism described herein is broader. This mechanism can be applied to any TCP connection, regardless of payload.</description>
