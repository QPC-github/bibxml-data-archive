    <title>"Interoperability Issues Between DMARC and Indirect Email Flows", Franck Martin, Eliot Lear, Tim Draegen, Elizabeth Zwicky, Kurt Andersen</title>

    <description>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and preferences for email message validation, disposition, and reporting.  However, the DMARC mechanism enables potentially disruptive interoperability issues when messages do not flow directly from the author's administrative domain to the final recipients. Collectively these email flows are referred to as indirect email flows.  This document describes these interoperability issues, and presents possible methods for addressing them.</description>
