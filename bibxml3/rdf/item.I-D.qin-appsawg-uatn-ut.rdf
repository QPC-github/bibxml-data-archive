    <description>Moving data center closer to end users can provide numerous benefits for pre-uploaded content: lower latency, increased robustness of delivery, and improved quality of user experience.  For these reasons, many Online Storage Service Providers(OSSPs),Photos Sharing Service Providers (PSSPs), and Videos Sharing Service Providers(VSSPs), etc., are scaling up their infrastructure, and many above Upload Service Providers(USPs)are also deploying their own cloud platforms to improve data upload rate.  It is generally desirable that a given content item generated by end users can be quickly and robustly delivered to the destination regardless of that end user's location or attachment network.  This is the motivation for deploying Upload Acceleration Transport Network(UATN) so it can propose an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from end users to the destination(data center or another end user, etc.).  However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such an upload acceleration mechanism.  The goal of this document is to explain the proposed UATN in detail for providing public upload acceleration service and interconnect existing upload acceleration systems as an open content delivery infrastructur.</description>
