    <title>"A Mechanism for Conveying Alternate Addresses using ICE Syntax", Andrew Hutton, John Elwell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hutton-mmusic-icemicrolite-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a mechanism for conveying multiple IP addresses of different address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for a given medium, in the same Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer. This proposed mechanism solves the backward compatibility which exists with ANAT, due to its syntax, and provides a migration path towards support for ICE.  The proposed mechanism is significantly less complex then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses ICE syntax.  The mechanism described in this document has been named ICE-microLite.</description>
