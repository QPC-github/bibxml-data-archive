    <title>"Data Center Benchmarking Terminology", Lucien Avramov, jhrapp@gmail.com</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-bmwg-dcbench-terminology-19.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as it is to introduce new terminologies applicable to performance evaluations of data center network equipment. This document establishes the important concepts for benchmarking network switches and routers in the data center and, is a pre-requisite to the test methodology publication [draft-ietf-bmwg-dcbench-methodology]. Many of these terms and methods may be applicable to network equipment beyond this publication's scope as the technologies originally applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere.</description>
