    <title>"Network Function Virtualization: Resource Orchestration Challenges", Gino Carrozzo, Robert Szabo, Kostas Pentikousis</title>

    <description>Network function virtualization (NFV) promises improved operations in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability, but orchestration, in general, and recursive orchestration, in particular, is still an item of ongoing research.  We summarize the current state of the art in open-source initiatives in this area and present current directions of research and development in terms of orchestration, resource decomposition and federation, policy-based resource management, measurement and analytics, and virtual network function (VNF) elasticity.</description>
