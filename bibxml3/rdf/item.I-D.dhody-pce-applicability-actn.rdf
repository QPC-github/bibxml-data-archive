    <title>"Applicability of Path Computation Element (PCE) for Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)", Dhruv Dhody, Young Lee, Daniele Ceccarelli</title>

    <description>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage large-scale multi-domain TE networks so as to facilitate network programmability, automation, efficient resource sharing, and end-to- end virtual service aware connectivity and network function virtualization services.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document examines the applicability of PCE to the ACTN framework.</description>
