    <description>This document describes a mechanism, that can be used to live-migrate opened TCP/UDP/other transport sessions between a mobile server and a mobile client. This can work even after a mobile node moved to a different subnet or disconnected, as long as a session did not timeout. It also describes limitations and includes NAT traversal scenarios and guidelines for "middlebox" vendors.</description>
