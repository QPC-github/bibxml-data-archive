    <title>"Marking behaviour of PCN-nodes", Philip Eardley</title>

    <description>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes: threshold marking and excess traffic marking.  Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first configured rate.  Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN- packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of a second configured rate.</description>
