    <description>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently working on an architecture for controlling media services.  As part of the MediaCtrl architecture the Media Resource Broker (MRB) was identified   as the component needed for intelligent, application level media service selection based on non-static signaling properties.  This document defines the mechanisms needed by the media servers to publish their capabilities and the mechanisms needed by the MRB to monitor the status of the media servers.</description>
