    <description>This document provides a framework of supporting multicast traffic in a network that uses Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3). Both infrastructure multicast and application-specific multicast are discussed. It describes the various mechanisms that can be used for delivering such traffic as well as the data plane and control plane considerations for each of the mechanisms.</description>
