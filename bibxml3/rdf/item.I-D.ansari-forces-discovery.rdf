    <description>This document describes a protocol for dynamically determining CE/FE element bindings discovery and inter-FE topology discovery and maintenance. Such a mechanism is needed for all these elements in the set to behave as a single network element, as required by the ForCES architecture. The discovery protocol operates during both the pre-association and post-association phases of ForCES protocol.</description>
