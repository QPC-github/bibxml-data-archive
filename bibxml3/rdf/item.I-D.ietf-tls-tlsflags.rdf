        <title>"A Flags Extension for TLS 1.3", Yoav Nir</title>
        <dc:date>2021-10-25T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that carry no interesting information except the 1-bit indication that a certain optional feature is supported.  Such extensions take 4 octets each.  This document defines a flags extension that can provide such indications at an average marginal cost of 1 bit each.  More precisely, it provides as many flag extensions as needed at 4 + the order of the last set bit divided by 8.</description>
