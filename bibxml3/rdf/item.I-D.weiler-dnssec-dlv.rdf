    <description>DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) is a mechanism for publishing DNSSEC trust anchors outside of the DNS delegation chain. It allows validating resolvers to validate DNSSEC-signed data from zones whose ancestors either aren't signed or don't publish Delegation Signer (DS) records for their children.</description>
