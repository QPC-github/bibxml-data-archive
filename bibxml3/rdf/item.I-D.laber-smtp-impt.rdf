    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-laber-smtp-impt-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes the protocol called Inter Mail Provider Trust (IMPT) which ensures that a cryptographically secured communication channel is always established with Transport Layer Security (TLS) when delivering messages via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) between Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) of pre-registered participants. Mainly the participants exchange SMTP routing information about their MTA infrastructure for this purpose.</description>
