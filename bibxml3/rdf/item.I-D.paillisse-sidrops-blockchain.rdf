    <description>This document analyzes how blockchain technology can be used to secure the allocation, delegation and binding to topological information of the IP address space.  The main outcomes of the analysis are that blockchain is suitable in environments with multiple distrusting parties and that Proof of Stake is a potential candidate for a consensus algorithm.</description>
