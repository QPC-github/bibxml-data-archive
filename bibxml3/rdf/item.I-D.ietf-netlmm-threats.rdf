    <title>"Security Threats to Network-Based Localized Mobility Management", James  Kempf, Christian Vogt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-netlmm-threats-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses security threats to network-based localized mobility management. Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between a localized mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface between a mobile access gateway and a mobile node. Threats to the former interface impact the localized mobility management protocol itself.</description>
