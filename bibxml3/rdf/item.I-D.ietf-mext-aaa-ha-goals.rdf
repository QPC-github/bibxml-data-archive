    <description>In commercial and enterprise deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a Mobility Services Provider (MSP).  In this case all protocol operations may need to be explicitly authorized and traced, requiring the interaction between Mobile IPv6 and the AAA infrastructure.  Integrating the AAA infrastructure (e.g.  NAS and AAA server) offers also a solution component for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping.  This document describes various scenarios where a AAA interface for Mobile IPv6 is required.  Additionally, it lists design goals and requirements for such an interface.</description>
