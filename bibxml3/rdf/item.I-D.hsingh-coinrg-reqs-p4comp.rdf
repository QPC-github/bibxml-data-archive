        <title>"Requirements for P4 Program Splitting for Heterogeneous Network Nodes", Hemant Singh, Marie-Jose Montpetit</title>
        <dc:date>2021-02-18T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>For distributed computing, the P4 research community has published a paper to show how to split a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous network nodes in a network.  Examples of nodes are a network switch, a smartNIC, or a host machine.  The paper has developed artifacts to split program based on latency, data rate, cost, etc.  However, the paper does not mention any requirements.  To provide guidance, this document covers requirements for splitting P4 programs for heterogeneous network nodes.</description>
