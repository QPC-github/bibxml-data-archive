        <title>"Gratuitous Neighbor Discovery: Creating Neighbor Cache Entries on First-Hop Routers", Jen Linkova</title>
        <dc:date>2021-07-05T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information.  This document updates RFC4861 to allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node.  It also updates RFC4861 and recommends nodes to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address.  The proposed change will minimize the delay and packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off- link destination from a new IPv6 address.</description>
