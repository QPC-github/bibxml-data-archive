    <description>To allow traversal of firewalls or provide additional network services such as QoS or supplemental bandwidth, it is necessary to deploy application-aware network elements.  Such network elements are costly to create, deploy, and are unable to adequately cope with changes to the application itself, stifling innovation.  This document describes a different approach, where the application explicitly signals its needs to the network.</description>
