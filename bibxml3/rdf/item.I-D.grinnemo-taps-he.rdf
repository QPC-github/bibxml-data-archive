    <description>Ideally, network applications should be able to select an appropriate transport solution from among available transport solutions. However, at present, there is no agreed-upon way to do this.  In fact, there is not even an agreed-upon way for a source end host to determine if there is support for a particular transport along a network path.  This draft addresses these issues, by proposing a Happy Eyeballs framework.  The proposed Happy Eyeballs framework enables the selection of a transport solution that according to application requirements, pre-set policies, and estimated network conditions is the most appropriate one.  Additionally, the proposed framework makes it possible for an application to find out whether a particular transport is supported along a network connection towards a specific destination or not.</description>
