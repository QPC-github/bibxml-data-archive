    <description>This document specifies a common protocol design template for authentication on the Hyper-text Transport Protocol (HTTP) involving multi-hop message exchanges.  To facilitate advanced authentication technologies such as hash-based exchanges, zero-knowledge password proof, or public-key authentications on HTTP, a kind of state management and key management facilities are required on the general HTTP authentication message framework.  Also, to optimize performance of such authentication schemes, a well-designed mechanism for key caching and re-authentication are needed.  The template defined in this document provides a generic foundation for implementing such advanced authentication technologies.</description>
