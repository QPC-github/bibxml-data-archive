    <description>Bluetooth Smart is the brand name for the Bluetooth low energy feature in the Bluetooth specification defined by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group.  The standard Bluetooth radio has been widely implemented and available in mobile phones, notebook computers, audio headsets and many other devices.  The low power version of Bluetooth is a specification that enables the use of this air interface with devices such as sensors, smart meters, appliances, etc.  The low power variant of Bluetooth has been standardized since revision 4.0 of the Bluetooth specifications, although version 4.1 or newer is required for IPv6.  This document describes how IPv6 is transported over Bluetooth low energy using IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.</description>
