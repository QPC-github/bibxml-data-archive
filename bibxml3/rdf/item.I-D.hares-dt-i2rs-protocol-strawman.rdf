    <description>This document provides a strawman proposal for the I2RS protocol covering the ephemeral data store and data flow requirements not covered by i2rs publication/subscription service or traceability.  It also proposes additions to YANG for the ephemeral data store and for additional data flow requirements.  It proposes additions to the NETCONF and RESTCONF for these additions.  Future versions of this document will propose changes to support the I2RS protocol security requirements.</description>
