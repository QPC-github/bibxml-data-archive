    <title>"Duplicate Address Detection Optimization Using Enhanced Neighbor Discovery", Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xia-16ng-end-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes a possible optimization to Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) which can be used to successfully terminate DAD early. The method is based on a positive RA message sent by an Neighbor Discovery Relay Agent that knows all the IPv6 addresses of the nodes currently attached to it.</description>
