    <title>"Alternative Proposed Model for RFC Editing and Publication", Brian Carpenter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-carpenter-rfced-model-00.txt</link>
    <description>The finishing process for a document that is approved for publication as an RFC currently involves a somewhat detailed and lengthy process. The system that executes that process involves a number of different actors, each bringing competency with different aspects of the overall process.  Ensuring that this process functions smoothly is critical to the mission of the organizations that publish documents in the RFC series.  This document proposes a framework for that system that aims to provide clear delineations of accountability and responsibility for each of the actors in this system.  It would require significant updates to RFC 8728 and RFC 8729, and minor updates to RFC 2850 and RFC 7841.  Discussion of this document takes place on the RFC Editor Futures mailing list (rfced-future@iab.org).</description>
