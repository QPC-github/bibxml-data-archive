    <title>"PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1", Kathleen Moriarty, Burt Kaliski, Andreas Rusch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moriarty-pkcs5-v2dot1-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides recommendations for the implementation of password-based cryptography, covering key derivation functions, encryption schemes, message-authentication schemes, and ASN.1 syntax identifying the techniques.  The recommendations are intended for general application within computer and communications systems, and as such include a fair amount of flexibility. They are particularly intended for the protection of sensitive information such as private keys, as in PKCS #8. It is expected that application standards and implementation profiles based on these specifications may include additional constraints.  Other cryptographic techniques based on passwords, such as password- based key entity authentication and key establishment protocols are outside the scope of this document.  Guidelines for the selection of passwords are also outside the scope.  This document represents a republication of PKCS #5 v2.1 from RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series. By publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF.  This document also obsoletes RFC 2898.</description>
