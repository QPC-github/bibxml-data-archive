    <description>With the deployment of centralized control, the traffic scheduling can be easier to accomplish with PathID carried in the data plane.  A PathID used to indicate a flow through a forwarding path which is not the default shortest path.  It is encapsulated in the packet at the ingress node, carried to indicate the forwarding at the transit node and decapsulated at the egress node.  This document describes how to accomplish flexible forwarding with PathID in traffic scheduling.</description>
