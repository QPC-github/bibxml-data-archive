    <title>"Precursor Notification for dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) Routing", Charles Perkins</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-perkins-manet-precursor-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol is intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks.  AODVv2 determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand convergence in dynamic topologies.  This document specifies a simple modification to AODVv2 (and possibly other reactive routing protocols) enabling faster notifications to known sources of traffic upon determination that a route for such traffic's destination has become invalid.</description>
