    <title>"Channel Binding Signalling for the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface", Robbie Harwood, Nico Williams</title>

    <description>Channel binding is a technique that allows applications to use a secure channel at a lower layer without having to use authentication at that lower layer.  The concept of channel binding comes from the Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS- API).  It turns out that the semantics commonly implemented are different than those specified in the base GSS-API RFC (RFC2743), and that that specification has a serious bug.  This document addresses both the inconsistency as-implemented and the specification bug.  This Internet-Draft proposes the addition of a "channel bound" return flag for the GSS_Init_sec_context() and GSS_Accept_sec_context() functions.  Two behaviors are specified: a default, safe behavior reflecting existing implementation deployments, and a behavior that is only safe when the application specifically tells the GSS-API that it (the application) supports the new behavior.  Additional API elements related to this are also added, including a new security context establishment API.</description>
