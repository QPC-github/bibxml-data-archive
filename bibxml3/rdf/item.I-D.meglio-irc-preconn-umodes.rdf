    <title>"Simple Extension to the IRC Protocol for Pre-Connection Usermode Setting", Dominick Meglio</title>

    <description>RFC2812 introduced the ability to set certain usermodes before connection has occurred via a simple extension to the USER command. However, this implementation is believed to be excessively limiting. The RFC2812 implementation only allows a limited number of modes (+i and +w) to be set. Modern IRC servers provide many more modes and a method is necessary to set these modes at the pre-connection stage. Therefore, this specification introduces a method to allow users to set arbitrary usermodes at the pre-connection stage while maintaining backward compatibility with RFC2812.</description>
