    <description>In this document, we provide a gap analysis to apply DMM deployment models to a 3GPP mobile core network. The DMM deployment models are described into five models for separation control and data plane, and the 3GPP mobile core network is a 4G-based extended architecture and 5G core network study architecture. We conduct the gap analysis to describe the technology that requires current standards-based applicability and extension for technical interoperability between two standardization organizations.</description>
