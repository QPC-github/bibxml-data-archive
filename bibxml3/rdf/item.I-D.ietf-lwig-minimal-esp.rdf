        <title>"Minimal IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)", Daniel Migault, Tobias Guggemos</title>

        <description>This document describes the minimal properties that an IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) implementation needs to meet to remain interoperable with the standard RFC4303 ESP.  Such a minimal version of ESP is not intended to become a replacement of the RFC 4303 ESP.  Instead, a minimal implementation is expected to be optimized for constrained environments while remaining interoperable with implementations of RFC 4303 ESP.  In addition, this document also provides some considerations for implementing minimal ESP in a constrained environment which includes limiting the number of flash writes, handling frequent wakeup / sleep states, limiting wakeup time, and reducing the use of random generation.  This document does not update or modify RFC 4303.  It provides a compact description of how to implement the minimal version of that protocol.  RFC 4303 remains the authoritative description.</description>
