    <description>The notional premise that different Autonomous Systems belong to different administrative authorities may not always hold.  A single administrative authority may instantiate services on and across multiple ASes.  A customer accessing those services can reasonably expect that attributes such as LOCAL_PREF that influence routing be applicable even across different ASes.  This document describes a mechanism to do so.</description>
