    <title>"ACTN Use-case for Multi-domain Operation Plane Change", Toshiaki Suzuki</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-suzuki-actn-multidomain-opc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes multiple virtual networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one to a backup one during a scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as network disaster.  Specifically, the necessity of interfaces between domain management systems to establish consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</description>
