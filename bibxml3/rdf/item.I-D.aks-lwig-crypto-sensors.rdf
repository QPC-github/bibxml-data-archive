    <description>This memo describes challenges associated with securing smart object devices in constrained implementations and environments.  The memo describes a possible deployment model suitable for these environments, discusses the availability of cryptographic libraries for small devices, presents some preliminary experiences in implementing small devices using those libraries, and discusses trade-offs involving different types of approaches.</description>
