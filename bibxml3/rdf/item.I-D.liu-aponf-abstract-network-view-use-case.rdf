    <title>"APONF Use Case: Using Abstract View of Network by Application Developers", Will, Tina Tsou, Georgios Karagiannis, Jose Saldana</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-liu-aponf-abstract-network-view-use-case-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a use case of Application Policy on Network Functions (APONF) that presents how service developers can profit by using an abstract view of the network during the programming and development process, instead of manipulating individual devices. In this way one can write software that programs an arbitrary network. APONF can be used to interface the programmed arbitrary network into network management policies, i.e., device configuration models.</description>
