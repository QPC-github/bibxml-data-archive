    <title>"NERD: A Not-so-novel EID to RLOC Database", Eliot Lear</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lear-lisp-nerd-09.txt</link>
    <description>LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow end sites to route to one another without injecting routes from one end of the Internet to another.  This memo presents an experimental database and a discussion of methods to transport the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs to routers in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.  Our analysis concludes that transport of of all EID/RLOC mappings scales well to at least 10^8 entries.</description>
