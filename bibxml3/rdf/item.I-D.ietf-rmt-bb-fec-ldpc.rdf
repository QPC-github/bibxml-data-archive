    <title>"Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Staircase and Triangle Forward Error  Correction (FEC) Schemes", Vincent Roca, Christoph Neumann, David Furodet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rmt-bb-fec-ldpc-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes two Fully-Specified FEC Schemes, LDPC- Staircase and LDPC-Triangle, and their application to the reliable delivery of data objects on the packet erasure channel (i.e., a communication path where packets are either received without any corruption or discarded during transmission).  These systematic FEC codes belong to the well known class of ``Low Density Parity Check'' (LDPC) codes, and are large block FEC codes in the sense of RFC3453.</description>
