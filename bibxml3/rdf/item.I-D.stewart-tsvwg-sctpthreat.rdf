    <description>Stream Control Transmission Protocol RFC2960 [2] is a multi-homed transport protocol. As such, unique security threats exists that are addressed in various ways within the protocol itself. This document attempts to detail the known security threats and there countermeasures as detailed in the current version of the SCTP Implementors guide (SCTP-IG). It is hoped that this information will provide some useful background information for many of the newest requirements spelled out in the SCTP-IG.</description>
