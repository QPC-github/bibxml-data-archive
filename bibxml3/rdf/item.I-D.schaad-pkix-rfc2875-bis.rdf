    <title>"Diffie-Hellman Proof-of-Possession Algorithms", Jim Schaad, Hemma Prafullchandra</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schaad-pkix-rfc2875-bis-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair.  This behavior is needed for such operations as creating the signature of a PKCS #10 certification request.  These algorithms are designed to provide a proof-of-possession of the private key and not to be a general purpose signing algorithm.  This document obsoletes RFC 2875.</description>
