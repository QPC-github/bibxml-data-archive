    <description>Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigm and can be directly applied to MPLS dataplane.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with Segment Routing header.  The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification and fault isolation in LSP with SPRING architecture.  This document illustrates the problem and describe a mechanism to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment Routing network over MPLS dataplane.</description>
