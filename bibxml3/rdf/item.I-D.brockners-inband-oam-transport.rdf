    <description>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) records operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-situ OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-situ OAM data fields can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension headers), and IPv4. Transport options are currently investigated as part of an implementation study.  This document is intended to only serve informational purposes.</description>
