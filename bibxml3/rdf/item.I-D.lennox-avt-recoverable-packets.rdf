    <title>"Marking and Selectively Retransmitting High-Priority Packets in the  Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP)", Jonathan Lennox</title>

    <description>In some circumstances, it is useful and desirable for the sender of an RTP stream to be able to deliver a subset of its RTP packets reliably. One example of this is a video codec which can encode a video stream such that decoder state can be maintained using just a subset of the packets encoded. However, existing RTP reliability mechanisms only define mechanisms which retransmit all the packets of an RTP stream. This document describes a mechanism by which the sender of an RTP stream can mark a subset of the packets of an RTP stream as high- priority recoverable packets, and by which the receiver of the stream can request retransmission of the high-priority packets.</description>
