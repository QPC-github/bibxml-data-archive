    <description>This document defines a profile that is a superset of that of the connection to IPv6 cellular networks defined in the IPv6 for Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Cellular Hosts document.  This document defines an IPv6 profile that a number of operators recommend in order to connect 3GPP mobile devices to an IPv6-only or dual-stack wireless network (including 3GPP cellular network) with a special focus on IPv4 service continuity features.  Both mobile hosts and mobile devices with capability to share their 3GPP mobile connectivity are in scope.</description>
