    <title>"Latching: Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT) for Media in Real-Time Communication", Emil Ivov, Hadriel Kaplan, Dan Wing</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ivov-mmusic-latching-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in RTC deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.  This document is non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the IETF community, as well as an informative description to manufacturers, and users.</description>
