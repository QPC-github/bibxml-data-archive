    <title>"Quality of Service for Ad hoc Optimized Link State Routing Protocol  (QOLSR)", Hakim Badis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-badis-manet-qolsr-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks provides shortest routes in terms of number of hops using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. In order to support multiple- metric routing criteria, a quality of service (QoS) extension can be added to OLSR functioning. No additional control traffic is generated (only augmented HELLO and TC messages). QOLSR protocol uses standard multipoint relays (MPRs) to ensure that the overhead is as low as possible for forwarding control traffic. Local QoS metrics information on links are used to calculate quality of service MPRs (QMPRS) and then flooded in the network by TC messages to calculate routing tables. QOLSR can find optimal paths on the known partial topology having the same performances that those on the whole network. These paths contain only QMPRs as intermediate nodes between a source destination pair. This memo describes the QOLSR protocol, which is an enhancement of OLSR to support multiple-metric QoS routing.</description>
