        <title>"Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Registry Restrictions and Recommendations", John Klensin, Asmus Freytag</title>

        <description>The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names combine rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without violating the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility, consistent with earlier specifications, for determining the labels that are allowed in particular zones.  Conformance to IDNA by registries and other implementations requires both parts.  Experience strongly suggests that the language describing those responsibilities was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable use of the specifications and that more details and discussion of circumstances would have been helpful.  Without making any substantive changes to IDNA, this specification updates two of the core IDNA documents (RFCs 5890 and 5891) and the IDNA explanatory document (RFC 5894) to provide that guidance and to correct some technical errors in the descriptions.</description>
