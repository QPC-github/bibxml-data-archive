    <description>This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility model. This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a transport layer and a signaling application model. This two-layer provides the ability to develope new signaling applications, while retaining the use of a common transport layer. This document will serve as guidence on how the NSIS architecture can be extended.</description>
