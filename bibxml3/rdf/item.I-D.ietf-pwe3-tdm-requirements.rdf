    <title>"Requirements for Edge-to-Edge Emulation of TDM Circuits over Packet  Switching Networks", Maximilian Riegel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pwe3-tdm-requirements-08.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the specific requirements for edge-to-edge emulation of circuits carrying Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals of the Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy as well as the Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy over packet-switched networks. It is aligned to the common architecture for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3). It makes references to the generic requirements for PWE3 where applicable and complements them by defining requirements originating from specifics of TDM circuits.</description>
