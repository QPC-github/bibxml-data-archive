    <title>"Localization for Mobile Nodes in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 Network", Haisheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jiang-netext-pmip-localization-00.txt</link>
    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the numbers of MNs which attaching to the same MAG is very large, how to manage those MNs is very urgent. Some MNs are active and have to update the location information frequently; other ones are in idle state so how to localize them is a little harder. This document proposes a scheme to localize the idle MN in the PMIPv6 network. When the MN is moving in the MD, the network can quickly obtain its location information to achieve the state synchronization and reduce the data forwarding delay.</description>
