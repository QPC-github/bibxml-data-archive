    <description>MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as specified in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the IETF.  The ITU-T has specified a Transport Network architecture.  This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network recommendations.  It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of contexts than just Transport Networks.  The definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms to be applied within the Transport Network context.</description>
