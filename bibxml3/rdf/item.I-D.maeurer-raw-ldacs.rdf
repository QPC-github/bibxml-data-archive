    <description>This document provides an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides a secure, scalable and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation.  LDACS is a scheduled, reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6.  LDACS shall provide a data link for IP network-based aircraft guidance.  High reliability and availability for IP connectivity over LDACS are therefore essential.</description>
