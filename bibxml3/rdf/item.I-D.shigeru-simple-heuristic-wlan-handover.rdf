    <description>This document discusses handover decision criteria for avoiding deterioration in communication quality during WLAN handover, in particular at handover initiation. We first describe problems for handover decision criteria employed by existing mobility management technologies, such as Mobile IP and mSCTP. We then propose the number of frame retransmissions as a simple heuristic for handover decisions and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we introduce our proposed method using the number of frame retransmissions.</description>
