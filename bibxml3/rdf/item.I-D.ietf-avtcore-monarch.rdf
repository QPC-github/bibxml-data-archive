    <title>"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework", Wenson Wu, Geoff Hunt, Philip Arden</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-avtcore-monarch-22.txt</link>
    <description>This memo proposes an extensible Real-Time Protocol (RTP) monitoring framework for extending RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) with a new RTCP Extended Reports (XR) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission or reception quality.  In this framework, a new XR block should contain a single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application. Applications may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and video.</description>
