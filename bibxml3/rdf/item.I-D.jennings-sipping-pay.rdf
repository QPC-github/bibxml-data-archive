    <title>"Payment for Services in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Cullen Jennings</title>

    <description>Service usage might require some form of compensation and this is also true for many communication systems where an entity receiving a call should be able to charge the caller. This is necessary for allowing fair communication between two communicating parties and is a major strategy for reducing the viability of SPAM. This draft proposes an approach for doing this in SIP using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). It relies on a third party to act as a payment provider and is designed for low value transactions. It does not aim to provide the same capability as other authentication, authorization and accounting backend infrastructures.</description>
