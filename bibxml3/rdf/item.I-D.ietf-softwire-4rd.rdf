    <title>"IPv4 Residual Deployment via IPv6 - a Stateless Solution (4rd)", Remi Despres, Sheng Jiang, Reinaldo Penno, Yiu Lee, Gang Chen, Maoke Chen</title>

    <description>For service providers to progressively deploy IPv6-only network domains while still offering IPv4 service to customers, this document specifies a stateless solution.  Its distinctive property is that TCP/UDP IPv4 packets are valid TCP/UDP IPv6 packets during domain traversal, and that IPv4 fragmentation rules are fully preserved end- to-end.  Each customer can be assigned one public IPv4 address, or several, or a shared address with a restricted port set.</description>
