    <description>This document defines a Centralized Conferencing Control Protocol (CCCP) as a part of the XCON Working Group protocols suite. CCCP uses a client-server model for creation, querying, and manipulation of XCON entities, conference objects and sub-objects. An XCON entity, which implements a CCCP server, provides a means for authorized CCCP clients (e.g. conference participants) to affect the behavior of a conference in the XCON system.</description>
