    <title>"Mobile IPv4 Route Optimization Using Mobile IPv6 Return Routability", Rajeev  Koodli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-mobopts-ipv4ro-00.txt</link>
    <description>The motivation for this document comes from considerations in implementing IPv6 Return Routability in an IPv4 network, especially where the Mobile Node and the Correspondent Nodes are capable of performing IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling. As a result, this document proposes an IPv4 Address extension to Mobile IPv6 Return Routability procedure which can provide route optimization for IPv4 traffic.</description>
