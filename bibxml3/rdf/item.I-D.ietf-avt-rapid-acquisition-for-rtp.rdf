    <description>When an RTP receiver joins a multicast session, it may need to acquire and parse certain Reference Information before it can process any data sent in the multicast session.  Depending on the join time, length of the Reference Information repetition (or appearance) interval, size of the Reference Information as well as the application and transport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver can usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the Acquisition Delay, varies and can be large.  This is an undesirable phenomenon for receivers that frequently switch among different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts.  In this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay. In this method, an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to the receiver precedes/accompanies the multicast stream.  This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition. The motivating use case for this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed audio and video.  However, this method can also be used in other types of multicast applications where the acquisition delay is long enough to be a problem.</description>
