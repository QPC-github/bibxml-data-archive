    <title>"Using HTTP GET with HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)", Martin Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-geopriv-held-get-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server responsible for that resource.  This ensures that requests generated by user agents that are unaware of the special status of a URI do not result in unhelpful responses and enables the use of HTTP GET for location configuration and dereference.</description>
