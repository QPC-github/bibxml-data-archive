    <description>This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Platform which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. It designs a new distributed conference architecture. In this architecture the component called MCS is responsible for the process of media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs which have enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake parts of media data process. All the MCSs form the reload overlay. The capacity and state information of conference UEs is stored in the RELOAD overlay. One or several MCSs will be selected to provide media process for a meeting  and these MCSs process all the  transcoding and transmission of audio and video data, and decide which media process task could be assigned to Conference UEs.</description>
