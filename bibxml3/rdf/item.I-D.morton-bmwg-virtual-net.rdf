    <description>Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  This memo investigates additional considerations when network functions are virtualized and performed in commodity off-the-shelf hardware.  NOTES:  3.4 Added inter-actions/dependencies within resource domains  4.3 Added new metrics for characterization: PDV, reordering, mean delay, etc.  4.4 Resolved the question of capacity and the 3x3 Matrix</description>
