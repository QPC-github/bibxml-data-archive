    <title>"Fluffy: Simplified Key Exchange for Constrained Environments", Thomas Hardjono, Ned Smith</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardjono-ace-fluffy-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a simplified key exchange protocol for the establishment of a symmetric key shared between two devices or entities within a constrained environment.  The pair-wise key establishment is performed using the mediation of a trusted Simple Key Distribution Center (SKDC) entity.  The protocol also supports the mediated distribution of a group-key among multiple devices or entities for the purposes of protecting multicast messages.</description>
