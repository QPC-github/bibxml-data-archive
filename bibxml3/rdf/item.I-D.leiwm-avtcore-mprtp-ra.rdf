    <title>"Multipath RTP based on RTP Relay Application (MPRTP-RA)", Lei Weimin, Wei Zhang, Shaowei Liu</title>

    <description>This document defines the framework of multipath transmission of real- time media based on relay. The framework allows participants to use multiple paths,including the default IP path and relay paths, to transport media in a RTP session. A relay path may via one or more RTP relay nodes which provide relay services for media data. This framework describes function blocks and behaviors of MPRTP-RA-capable RTP agent and RTP relay. The framework also defines multipath transport protocol by extending RTP, and relay control protocol named OpenPath.</description>
