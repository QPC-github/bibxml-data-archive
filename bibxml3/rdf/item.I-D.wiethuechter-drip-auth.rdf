    <description>This document describes how to include trust into the ASTM Remote ID specification defined in ASTM F3411-19 under a Broadcast Remote ID (RID) scenario.  It defines a few different message schemes (based on the Authentication Message) that can be used to assure past messages sent by a UA and also act as an assurance for UA trustworthiness in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node.</description>
