        <description>This specification updates RFC5545 by introducing a number of new iCalendar properties and components which are of particular use for event publishers and in social networking.  This specification also defines a new STRUCTURED-DATA property for iCalendar RFC5545 to allow for data that is directly pertinent to an event or task to be included with the calendar data.</description>
