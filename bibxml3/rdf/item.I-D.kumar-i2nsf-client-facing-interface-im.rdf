    <description>This document defines an information model for Consumer-Facing interface to Security Controller based on the requirements identified in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-client-facing-interface-req].  The information model defines various managed objects and relationship among these objects needed to build the interface.  The information model is organized based on the "Event-Condition-Event" (ECA) policy model defined by a capability information model for Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-capability].</description>
