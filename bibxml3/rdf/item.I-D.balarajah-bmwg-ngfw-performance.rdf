    <title>"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Security Device Performance", Balamuhunthan Balarajah, Carsten Rossenhoevel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-balarajah-bmwg-ngfw-performance-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides benchmarking terminology and methodology for next-generation network security devices including next-generation firewalls (NGFW), intrusion detection and prevention solutions (IDS/ IPS) and unified threat management (UTM) implementations.  The document aims to strongly improve the applicability, reproducibility, and transparency of benchmarks and to align the test methodology with today's increasingly complex layer 7 application use cases.  The main areas covered in this document are test terminology, traffic profiles and benchmarking methodology for NGFWs to start with.</description>
