    <title>"The Diameter 'Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB)' Application", Mark Jones, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jones-diameter-abfab-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond Web (ABFAB) architecture provides cross-domain authentication, authorization and accounting functionality by utilizing well-established technologies, such as Diameter, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Generic Security Services API (GSS-API).  This document defines a Diameter application for usage with the ABFAB architecture to convey authentication information, and authorization decisions from the Diameter server (acting as the identity provider) to the Diameter client (acting as a relying party) encoded in a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) encoding.</description>
