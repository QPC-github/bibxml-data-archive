    <title>"Using Client Puzzles to Protect TLS Servers From Denial of Service Attacks", Yoav Nir</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nir-tls-puzzles-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a mechanism for mitigating denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on TLS servers.  Attackers are limited in their ability to cause resource waste on the server by requiring proof of work by the client before these CPU resources are expended.</description>
