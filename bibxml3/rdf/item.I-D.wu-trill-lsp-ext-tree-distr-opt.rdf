    <title>"LSP extension for Tree Distribution Optimization across sites", Qin Wu, Hao Weiguo</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wu-trill-lsp-ext-tree-distr-opt-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an extension to LSP for the Rbridge in one site to advertise Global VLAN scope and associated link attribute to all the Rbridges both in the site of that Border Rbridge and the other adjacent sites in the same campus.  With this extension, RBridges can prune the distribution tree of multi-destination frames according to the scope of the VLAN and link attribute defined in this document.</description>
