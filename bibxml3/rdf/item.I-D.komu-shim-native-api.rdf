    <title>"Native Application Programming Interfaces for SHIM Layer Prococols", Miika  Komu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-komu-shim-native-api-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes extensions to the current networking APIs for protocols based on identifier/locator split. Currently, the document focuses on HIP, but the extensions can be used also by other protocols similar "shim" layer protocols. Using the API extensions, new SHIM aware applications can gain a better control of the SHIM layer and endpoint identifiers. For example, the applications can query and set SHIM related attributes, or specify their own endpoint identifiers for a host. In addition, a new indirection element called endpoint descriptor is defined for SHIM aware applications.</description>
