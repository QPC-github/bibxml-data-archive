    <title>"Interoperable Domain Name System (DNS) Server Cookies", Donald Eastlake, Mark Andrews</title>

    <description>DNS cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a variety of denial-of-service and amplification, forgery, or cache poisoning attacks by off-path attackers. This document specifies a means of producing interoperable strong cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations will interoperate with standard clients. This document updates RFC 7873.</description>
