    <title>"Timer Enhancements to Reduce Failover Times for the Virtual Router  Redundancy Protocol for IPv4", Robert Hott</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-vrrp-ipv4-timers-02.txt</link>
    <description>The router survivability capability provided by the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv4 (VRRPv4) satisfies the requirements for many LAN environments. There are, however, LAN environments that have sub-second failover requirements and thus a need for finer granularity of the VRRP timers. This draft proposes extensions to VRRPv4 [RFC 3768] for specifying sub-second Advertisement Intervals. A new message type is introduced which permits the timer granularity for the Advertisement Interval to be specified. In addition, a new field is introduced permitting the specification of the number of missed ADVERTISEMENTs before a Virtual Router Master is declared down.</description>
