    <description>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy to mandate the application in the host to change in the first place, the network layer may have to have a solution to support conventional IPv4 appliations in the IPv6 only network, especially when there are multiple applications need to be supported.  This document describes a mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technology which could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility.  A new well known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination address translation and network assigned prefix will be used for source address translation.</description>
