        <description>This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service models (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model (L3SM)) to Traffic Engineering (TE) models (e.g., the TE Tunnel or the Virtual Network (VN) model). These models are referred to as TE Service Mapping Model and are applicable generically to the operator's need for seamless control and management of their VPN services with underlying TE support.  The models are principally used for monitoring and diagnostics of the management systems to show how the service requests are mapped onto underlying network resource and TE models.</description>
