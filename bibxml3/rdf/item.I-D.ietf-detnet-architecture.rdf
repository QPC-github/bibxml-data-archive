    <description>This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain.  Techniques used include: 1) reserving data plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow; 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology; and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path.  DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower layer technologies such as MPLS and IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN).</description>
