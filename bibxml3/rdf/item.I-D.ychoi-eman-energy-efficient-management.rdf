    <description>Wireless network devices which have limited resources (e.g., power supply, memory, computing capabilities, and so on) should consider energy-efficient management.  However, the existing network architectures for the network devices have some problems on energy management about device failures and errors.  To improve the energy management problem, this document proposes energy-efficient management framework for the network devices.</description>
