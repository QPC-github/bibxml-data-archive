    <description>This document introduces a framework, i.e., an application layer based lifetime [applicationiid] to enable applications maintaining their users' privacy as well as controlling the number of Interface IDs (IIDs) per network adapter. It will also explain different approaches that can be used for maintaining the lifetime of an IID. We also compare this framework to the other available mechanisms. This document also explains when to remove deprecated IP addresses from the a network interface.</description>
