    <description>This document describes the distributed data export mechanism that allows multiple data streams to be managed by using a single subscription.  Specifically, device can decide to decompse one subscription into multiple subscriptions to the line-cards.  So that each line-card can directly push data to the collector without passing through a broker for internal consolidation.  And the device can indicate the subscription decomposition result to the receiver to check the data integrity.</description>
