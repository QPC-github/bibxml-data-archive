    <title>"SMTP Service Extension for Greylisting Operations", Hector Santos, Evan Harris</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-santos-smtpgrey-02.txt</link>
    <description>GREYLIST is a SMTP extension to formalize the widely supported Greylisting mail filtering method and to help support SMTP rejected transports by following a new formal structured 4yz server temporary rejection response by including a "retry=time-delay" tag string which SMTP clients can use to optimize the rescheduling of the mail delivery attempts.  With adoption, network overhead reduction in wasteful mail delivery attempts will be realized.</description>
