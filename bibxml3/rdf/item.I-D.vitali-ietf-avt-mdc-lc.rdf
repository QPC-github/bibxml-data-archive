    <title>"Standard-compatible Multiple-Description Coding (MDC) and Layered Coding  (LC) of Audio/Video Streams", Andrea Vitali, Marco Fumagalli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vitali-ietf-avt-mdc-lc-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an efficient way to ensure erasure resilient, scalable transmission of encoded multimedia sources via RTP using standard-compatible Multiple Description Coding (MDC) and Layered Coding (LC) together with interleaving, thus allowing a graceful degradation of the application quality with increasing packet loss rate and decreasing bandwidth/throughput on the network. This document describes what information needs to be communicated out-of-band to use a specific MDC/LC scheme and what information is needed in RTP packets to identify what description/layer they carry. Definitions for SDP and MIME are provided.</description>
