        <title>"Extensible Prioritization Scheme for HTTP", Kazuho Oku, Lucas Pardue</title>
        <dc:date>2022-01-17T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to communicate its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes responses to its requests, and also allows a server to hint to a downstream intermediary how its responses should be prioritized when they are forwarded.  This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing responses.  These share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility.</description>
