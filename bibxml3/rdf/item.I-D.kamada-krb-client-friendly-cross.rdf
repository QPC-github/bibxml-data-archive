    <title>"Client-Friendly Cross-Realm Model for Kerberos 5", Ken'ichi Kamada, Shoichi  Sakane</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kamada-krb-client-friendly-cross-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which is suitable for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5.  This model relieves the clients of the traversal cost by two means.  One moves the cost of consecutive Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges from clients to Key Distribution Centers (KDCs).  The other reduces the traversal cost itself by generating a direct inter-realm relationship between two realms.  The document describes behavior of clients and KDCs, but does not specify any wire format, which need to be specified separately.</description>
