    <description>RFC7432 defines Ethernet VPN as a BGP address family that makes use of Typed NLRIs. IANA has a registry called "EVPN Route Types" that allocates values to Route Types. The purpose of this document is to solicit IANA the registration of a route type value for a vendor specific usage, as well as the definition of the EVPN NLRI for that route.</description>
