    <title>"TRILL: Parent Selection in Distribution Trees", Howard Yang, Ayan Banerjee, Donald Eastlake, Radia Perlman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yang-trill-parent-seletion-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a protocol extension in TRILL IS-IS and a parent selection tiebreak algorithm in the calculation of distribution trees in TRILL. The proposal is to modify the current algorithm to improve the stability of the distribution trees when multiple equal cost parents are present. It also offers the capabilities of pinning down multi-destination traffic and re-shaping the distribution trees to improve the traffic load balancing.</description>
