    <description>Due to their critical role in a network, the protection of routing equipements is crucial, particularly against subversion attacks.  For this purpose, we integrate a trusted plane in the network equipments related to the routing protocols (e.g.  OSPF, BGP, RIP).  This trusted plane is realized by a trusted element embedded or connected to the network equipment.</description>
