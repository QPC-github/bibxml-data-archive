    <title>"PSC protocol updates for non-revertive operation", Tae-sik Cheung, Alessandro D'Alessandro, Huub van Helvoort</title>

    <description>This document optionally updates [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", to change non-revertive operation to be aligned with the behavior defined in [RFC4427] and in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.  An operator command, Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) is also included to revert traffic to the working path in non-revertive operation.</description>
