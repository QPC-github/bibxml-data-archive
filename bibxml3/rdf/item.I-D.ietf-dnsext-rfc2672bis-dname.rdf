    <title>"DNAME Redirection in the DNS", Scott Rose, Wouter Wijngaards</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsext-rfc2672bis-dname-26.txt</link>
    <description>The DNAME record provides redirection for a sub-tree of the domain name tree in the DNS system.  That is, all names that end with a particular suffix are redirected to another part of the DNS.  This is a revision to the original specification in RFC 2672 (which this document obsoletes) as well as updating RFC 3363 and RFC 4294 to align with this revision.</description>
