    <title>"Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)", Michael Jones, J. Bradley, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-oauth-proof-of-possession-11.txt</link>
    <description>This specification defines how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of- possession key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof-of-possession of the key by the presenter.  Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.</description>
