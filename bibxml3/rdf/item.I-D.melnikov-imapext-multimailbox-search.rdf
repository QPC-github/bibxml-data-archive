    <title>"IMAP4 Multimailbox SEARCH Extension", Barry Leiba, Alexey Melnikov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melnikov-imapext-multimailbox-search-03.txt</link>
    <description>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various searches to complete.  This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.Note  A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to ietf-imapext@imc.org.</description>
