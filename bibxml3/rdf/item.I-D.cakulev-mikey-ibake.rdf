    <title>"MIKEY-IBAKE: Identity-Based Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)", Violeta Cakulev, Ganapathy Sundaram</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cakulev-mikey-ibake-06.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a key management protocol variant for the multimedia Internet keying (MIKEY) protocol which relies on a trusted key management service.  In particular, this variant utilizes Identity Based Authenticated Key Exchange framework which allows the participating clients to perform mutual authentication and derive a session key in an asymmetric identity based encryption framework. This protocol, in addition to providing mutual authentication, eliminates the key escrow problem that is common in standard Identity Based Encryption and provides perfect forward and backward secrecy.</description>
