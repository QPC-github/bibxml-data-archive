    <title>"Observing Resources in CoAP", Klaus Hartke</title>

    <description>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending new representations to clients and provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at the server.</description>
