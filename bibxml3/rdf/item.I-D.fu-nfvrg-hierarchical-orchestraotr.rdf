    <title>"Framework of Hierarchical Orchestrator in NFV Deployment", Qiao Fu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fu-nfvrg-hierarchical-orchestraotr-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses about the framework of Orchestrator in the NFV deployment.  A hierarchical framework of Orchestrator is then proposed.  Such framework is very important for large scale NFV deployment in Operator networks, since multi-site of NFV deployment and management should be considered.  This draft will further discuss the responsibilities of the multi-layers of the Orchestrator and the interfaces between them.</description>
