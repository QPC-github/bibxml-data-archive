    <title>"Trust Requirements in a Federated World", Josh Howlett, Rhys Smith, Margaret Wasserman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-howlett-abfab-trust-router-ps-03.txt</link>
    <description>TODO: This document outlines the requirements for trust in a federated environment, and enumerates the requirements for a trust infrastructure.  It also examines existing trust infrastructures given these requirements and concludes that none fulfil all of the requirements, and suggests that maybe a new one is required that does.</description>
