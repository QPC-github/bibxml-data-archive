    <description>This short memo outlines the author's thoughts of current status and future development questions around IETF's financing mechanisms.  This memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community should have.  The memo is the first part of the author's goal to document the status and various challenges and opportunities associated with the IETF Administrative Activity (IASA), in the context of the so called "IASA 2.0" project.  The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.</description>
