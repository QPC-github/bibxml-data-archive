    <description>The CoRE working group has proposed a Resource Directory (RD) solution to facilitate the discovery of the resources provided by constrained sensor and actuator networks. For such a mechanism to be effectively deployable, endpoints must first discover the existence of an RD in the network before being able to exploit its functionalities. This document presents Proactive RD Discovery (PRD); a scalable and effective mechanism to discover RDs. To achieve such qualities, PRD follows an announce-based model that builds upon CoAP Group Communication. PRD aims to provide important performance in terms of energy consumption, generated traffic, expressivity, and RD discovery time.</description>
