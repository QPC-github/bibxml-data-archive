    <title>"Routing oscillations using BGP multiple paths advertisement", Virginie Van  den Schrieck, Olivier Bonaventure</title>

    <description>The advertisement of multiple paths for the same prefix in the Border Gateway Protocol is possible by using an extension to the attributes developed for multiprotocol transfer. This allows better path diversity in the adj-rib-ins, and can prevent some routing inconsistencies with Route Reflection. However, if not carefully used, this mechanism can also introduce routing oscillations and inconsistencies in topologies with Route Reflection that were correct without this extension.</description>
