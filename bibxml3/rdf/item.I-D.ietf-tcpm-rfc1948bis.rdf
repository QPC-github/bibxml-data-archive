    <title>"Defending Against Sequence Number Attacks", Fernando Gont, Steven Bellovin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tcpm-rfc1948bis-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path attacker guessing the sequence numbers in use by a target connection are reduced.  This document revises (and formally obsoletes) RFC 1948, and takes the ISN generation algorithm originally proposed in that document to Standards Track, formally updating RFC 793.</description>
