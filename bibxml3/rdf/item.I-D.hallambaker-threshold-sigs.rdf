        <description>A Threshold signature scheme is described.  The signatures created are computationally indistinguishable from those produced using the Ed25519 and Ed448 curves as specified in RFC8032 except in that they are non-deterministic.  Threshold signatures are a form of digital signature whose creation requires two or more parties to interact but does not disclose the number or identities of the parties involved.  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/ (http://whatever)Discussion of this draft should take place on the CFRG mailing list (cfrg@irtf.org), which is archived at .</description>
