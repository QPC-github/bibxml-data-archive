    <title>"Hybrid Subscription for Multicast Reciever Mobility in MIPv6", Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xia-multimob-hybrid-00.txt</link>
    <description>In MIPv6 specification, there are two basic methods for mobile multicast: 1) via a bi-directional tunnel from MN to its Home Agent;2) via a local multicast router on the foreign link being visited.  In this memo, a hybrid method is introduced.  MN subscribes multicast service through Home agent at first.  Then, MN changes its subscription router to a local multicast router which can provide the same multicast service.</description>
