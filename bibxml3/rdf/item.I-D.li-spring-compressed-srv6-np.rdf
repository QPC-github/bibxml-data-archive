    <description>Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging a new type of Routing Extension Header, called Segment Routing Header (SRH).  However, the overhead introduced by SRH may be a challenge for existing hardware, which may influence on the forwarding performance and the payload efficiency.  This document defines a compressed SRv6 network programming mechanism in order to reduce the overhead of SRv6 by introducing the Compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) and the Compressed SRH (C-SRH).  The C-SRH can be a new Routing Header or an enhancement of SRH.</description>
