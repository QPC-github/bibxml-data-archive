    <description>For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased. As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide. Remote participation with more than one person is considered a hub.  Three types of remote hubs are defined.   Some exist today; other types may exist in the future.   Each has its own characteristics.  - Remote Participation Hubs (future) - Remote Viewing Hubs (today) - Enduring Local Meetups (today)  This document defines a Remote Viewing Hub (RVH).  Other documents define the other types of hubs.  A common structure of sections will be used as far as possible for all hub types.</description>
