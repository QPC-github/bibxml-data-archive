    <title>"Capabilities Advertisement with LDP", Shivani Aggarwal</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shivani-mpls-ldp-capability-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities TLV, that is expected to facilitate the introduction of new capabilities in the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) by providing graceful capability advertisement without requiring that LDP peering be terminated. The "LDP peering" in this document refers to the TCP connection between the 2 routers and not the actual session. The "LDP session" refers to the connection after the initialization message has been successfully processed and the session is marked operational.</description>
