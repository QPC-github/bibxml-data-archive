    <title>"Requirements for Manageability Sections in Routing Area Drafts", Adrian  Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-farrel-rtg-manageability-requirements-01.txt</link>
    <description>It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been retrofitted to protocols. This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements. This document specifies the requirement for all new Routing Area Internet-Drafts to include an "Manageability Considerations" section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.</description>
