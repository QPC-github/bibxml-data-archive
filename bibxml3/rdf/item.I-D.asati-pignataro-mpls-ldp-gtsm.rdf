    <description>The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) describes a generalized use of a packets Time to Live (TTL) (IPv4) or Hop Limit (IPv6) to verify that the packet was sourced by a node on a connected link, thereby protecting the router's IP control-plane from CPU utilization based attacks.  This technique improves security and is used by many protocols.  This document defines the GTSM use for Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).</description>
