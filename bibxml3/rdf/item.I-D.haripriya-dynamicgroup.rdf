    <title>"LDAP: Dynamic Groups for LDAPv3", S Haripriya</title>

    <description>This document describes the requirements, semantics, schema elements, and operations needed for a dynamic group feature in LDAP. A dynamic group is defined here as a group object with a membership list of distinguished names that is dynamically generated using LDAP search criteria. The dynamic membership list may then be interrogated by LDAP search and compare operations, and may also be used to find the groups that an object is a member of. This feature eliminates a huge amount of the administrative effort required today for maintaining group memberships and role-based operations in large enterprises.</description>
