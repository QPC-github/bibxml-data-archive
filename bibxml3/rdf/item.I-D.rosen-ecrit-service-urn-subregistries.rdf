    <description>In most countries, there are multiple kinds of police forces. RFC5031 defines a "Service URN" which is used to route emergency calls.  The urn has a sub registry for different kinds of emergency services that may be reached from different telephone numbers or service numbers (as opposed to a single number like 112).  In many countries, the "police" service is not a single service, but more than one service where the service area and/or types of emergencies they respond to are different.  In some countries there are multiple ambulance services.  This document defines sub registries for urn:service:sos.police, urn:service:sos.ambulance and, for completeness, urn:service:sos.fire.  It also provides an initial set of entries for these sub registries.  These services are in addition to the base urn:service:sos.police, etc. services.</description>
