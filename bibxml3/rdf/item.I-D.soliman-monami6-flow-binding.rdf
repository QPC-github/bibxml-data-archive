    <description>This document introduces extensions to Mobile IPv6 [1] and Nemo Basic Support [2] that allow nodes to bind one or more flows to a care-of address.  These extensions allow multihomed nodes to take full advantage of the different properties associated with each of their interfaces.</description>
