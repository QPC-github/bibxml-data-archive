    <title>"The EAP TLS Authentication Protocol", Daniel Simon, Bernard Aboba, Ryan  Hurst</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-simon-emu-rfc2716bis-13.txt</link>
    <description>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, provides support for multiple authentication methods.  Transport Level Security (TLS) provides for mutual authentication, integrity- protected ciphersuite negotiation and key exchange between two endpoints.  This document defines EAP-TLS, which includes support for certificate-based mutual authentication and key derivation.  This document obsoletes RFC 2716.  A summary of the changes between this document and RFC 2716 is available in Appendix A.</description>
