    <title>"AES-CCM ECC Cipher Suites for TLS", David McGrew, Daniel Bailey, Matthew Campagna, Robert Dugal</title>

    <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Counter and CBC-MAC Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication.  The AES-CCM algorithm is amenable to compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained environments, while at the same time providing a high level of security.  The ciphersuites defined in this document use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and are advantageous in networks with limited bandwidth.</description>
