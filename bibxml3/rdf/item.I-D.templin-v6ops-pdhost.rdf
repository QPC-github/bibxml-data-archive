        <title>"IPv6 Prefix Delegation and Multi-Addressing Models", Fred Templin</title>
        <dc:date>2021-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Requesting nodes typically acquire IPv6 prefixes from a prefix delegation service for the network.  The requesting node can provision the prefix according to whether it acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks and/or as a host on behalf of its local applications.  In the latter case, the requesting node can use portions of the delegated prefix for its own multi-addressing purposes.  This document therefore considers prefix delegation models for both the classic routing and various multi-addressing use cases.</description>
