        <title>"A YANG Data Model for Challenge-Response-based Remote Attestation Procedures using TPMs", Henk Birkholz, Michael Eckel, Shwetha Bhandari, Eric Voit, Bill Sulzen, Liang Xia, Tom Laffey, Guy Fedorkow</title>

        <description>This document defines YANG RPCs and a small number of configuration nodes required to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from a device, following the operational context defined in TPM-based Network Device Remote Integrity Verification. Complementary measurement logs are also provided by the YANG RPCs, originating from one or more roots of trust for measurement (RTMs). The module defined requires at least one TPM 1.2 or TPM 2.0 as well as a corresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), included in the device components of the composite device the YANG server is running on.</description>
