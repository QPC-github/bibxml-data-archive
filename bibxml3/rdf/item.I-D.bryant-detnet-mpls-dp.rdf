    <description>This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane operation over an MPLS Packet Switched Networks.  This document is a derivative work from draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01.  Whether this is published as a stand-alone text, or serves as a focal point to refine the MPLS design and the key point are subsequently re-merged with draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01 is a matter for the DETNET WG, as is the editorship of any WG text.</description>
