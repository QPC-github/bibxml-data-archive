    <description>This document describes procedures to support node protection for Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths (MP LSPs) built by LDP ("Label Distribution Protocol"), or simply mLDP.  In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) LSR of N must learn the Merge Point (MPT) LSR(s) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails.  Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing P2P LSPs originated from the PLR LSR to the MPT LSRs while bypassing LSR node N.</description>
