    <description>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) provide origin authentication and integrity of DNS data.  However, the current resolver Application Programming Interface (API) does not specify how a validating stub resolver should communicate results of DNSSEC processing back to the application.  This document describes an API between applications and a validating stub resolver that allows applications to control the DNSSEC validation process and obtain results of DNSSEC processing.</description>
