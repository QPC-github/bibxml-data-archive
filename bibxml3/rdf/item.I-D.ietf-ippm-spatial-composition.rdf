    <title>"Spatial Composition of Metrics", Al Morton, Emile Stephan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ippm-spatial-composition-16.txt</link>
    <description>This memo utilizes IP Performance Metrics that are applicable to both complete paths and sub-paths, and defines relationships to compose a complete path metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy w.r.t. the actual metrics.  This is called Spatial Composition in RFC 2330.  The memo refers to the Framework for Metric Composition, and provides background and motivation for combining metrics to derive others.  The descriptions of several composed metrics and statistics follow.</description>
