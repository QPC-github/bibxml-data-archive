    <description>RBridges implement the TRILL protocol, which in turn makes use of an extended version of the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) routing protocol to determine topology and frame forwarding and for the distribution and synchronization of data. RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding with zero configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and multipathing for both unicast and multicast traffic. Rbridges also support VLANs. This document specifies some details of IS-IS PDUs used in TRILL.</description>
