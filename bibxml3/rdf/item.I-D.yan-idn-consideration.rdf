    <description>This document aims to pinpoint the work scope of Intelligence Driven Network (IDN) and mine the potential standardization work.  Firstly, the problems and new requirements for the existing methods are analyzed.  Numbers of high value use-cases are proposed as examples to instantiate them.  A benchmark framework design is proposed, which is important during the machine learning and inference process. Finally, a reference model of IDN is proposed, based on which the potential standardization work is analyzed.</description>
