    <title>"Pervasive Attack: A Threat Model and Problem Statement", Richard Barnes, Bruce Schneier, Cullen Jennings, Ted Hardie</title>

    <description>Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of "pervasive" attack on Internet communications.  In this document, we review the main attacks that have been published, and develop a threat model that describes these pervasive attacks.  Based on this threat model, we discuss the techniques that can be employed in Internet protocol design to increase the protocols robustness to pervasive attacks.</description>
