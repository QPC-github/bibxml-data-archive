        <description>This document describes the Remote APDU Call Protocol Secure (RACS) protocol, dedicated to Grid of Secure Elements (GoSE). These servers host Secure Elements (SE), i.e. tamper resistant chips offering secure storage and cryptographic resources.  Secure Elements are microcontrollers whose chip area is about 25mm2; they deliver trusted computing services in constrained environments.  RACS supports commands for GoSE inventory and data exchange with secure elements. It is designed according to the representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. RACS resources are identified by dedicated URIs. An HTTP interface is also supported.  An open implementation [OPENRACS] is available (https://github.com/purien) for various OS.</description>
