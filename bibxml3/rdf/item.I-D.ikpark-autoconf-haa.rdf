    <description>Most of MANET address autoconfiguration mechanisms introduce significant load like message flooding, or are dependent on the underlying routing protocols. This document proposes a new mechanism that is intended to minimize these drawbacks. It is also designed to be applicable for hybrid MANET, where a MANET is connected to Internet through one or more MANET border routers.</description>
