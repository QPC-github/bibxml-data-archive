        <title>"Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise Transfer Options Supporting Robust Transmission", Mohamed Boucadair, Jon Shallow</title>
        <dc:date>2021-05-26T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies alternative Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise transfer options: Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options.  These options are similar to, but distinct from, the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options defined in RFC 7959.  Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options are not intended to replace Block1 and Block2 Options, but rather have the goal of supporting Non-confirmable messages for large amounts of data with fewer packet interchanges.  Also, the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options support faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</description>
