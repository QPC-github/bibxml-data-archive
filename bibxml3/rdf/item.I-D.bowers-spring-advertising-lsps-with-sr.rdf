    <description>Segment routing uses globally-known labels to accomplish forwarding along shortest paths, and label stacks to accomplish explicit routing along arbitrary paths.  These labels are advertised using an IGP. This draft describes how label bindings corresponding to RSVP, LDP, BGP labeled-unicast, and static LSPs are advertised in segment routing and how these labels can be combined with other segment routing labels to create forwarding paths.  This draft also describes how context labels for egress node protection are advertised in using segment routing IGP extensions.</description>
