    <description>SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml] defines an initial set of base and regular attributes which are tied to a particular version of SenML. SenML also allows the definition of additional attributes by extending the syntax with a new label.  Allowing the extension of attributes brings the problem of how do endpoints negotiate whether the new attribute can be used or not?  This document discusses the issue and proposes some potential solutions to this issue.</description>
