    <title>"Requirement for (G)MPLS implantation over Ethernet", Jaihyung Cho</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jaihyung-ccamp-lserequirement-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this draft, we propose requirement to implement MPLS technology for Ethernet switched network. Ethernet has become major building block in local area network and the area of deployment is quickly expanding to core network. While there have been industry needs to overcome weakness of Ethernet, MPLS has not been considered as key technology to improve Ethernet. Currently MPLS [RFC3031] and GMPLS [GARCH] architecture do not define label-switching function on L2SC interface, i.e. over LAN media. Hence, it is necessary to discuss lightweight implementation of MPLS for Ethernet. Since there is disparity in requirements depending on hierarchy of Ethernet, it is appropriate to separate discussion in Customer Premise Network (CPN), Access Network (AN) and Core Network (CN). Some candidate methods to consider for label encoding for Ethernet are discussed.</description>
