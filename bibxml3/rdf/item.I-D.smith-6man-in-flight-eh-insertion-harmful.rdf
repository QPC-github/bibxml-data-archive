    <description>In the past few years, as well as currently, there have and are a number of proposals to insert IPv6 Extension Headers into existing IPv6 packets while in-flight.  This contradicts explicit prohibition of this type of IPv6 packet proccessing in the IPv6 standard.  This memo describes the possible failures that can occur with EH insertion, the harm they can cause, and the existing model that is and should continue to be used to add new information to an existing IPv6 and other packets.</description>
