    <title>"Using Device-provided Location-Related Measurements in Location Configuration Protocols", Martin Thomson, James Winterbottom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-geopriv-held-measurements-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location- related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</description>
