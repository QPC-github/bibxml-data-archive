    <description>In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing can effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is also facing with the security issues caused by attacks of potential malicious  users.  Lots  of  algorithms  are  proposed  in  existing literatures  to  cope  with  the  potential  attacks.  However,  the traditional strategies are mainly suitable for relative simple and ideal attack such as the all "1" or all "0" attack. Therefore, we define a more universal anti Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) framework in the document, which can better cope with the probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer to the reality.</description>
