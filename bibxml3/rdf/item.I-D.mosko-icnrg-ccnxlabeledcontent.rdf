    <description>This document defines an RFC3986 URI compliant identifier called a Labeled Segment URI in which name segments carry a label.  This allows differentiation between unrelated resources with similar identifiers.  A URI scheme that specifies the use of labeled segment URIs conforms to the encoding rules presented here.  This document also describes Labeled Content Information - a labeled segment URI (LS-URI) representation of network data.  This scheme, called "lci:", is applicable to network protocols such as Content Centric networks (CCN).  Labeled Content Information applies specific labels to each name segment of a URI to disambiguate between resources with similar names.  This document defines a specific set of segment labels with label semantics.</description>
