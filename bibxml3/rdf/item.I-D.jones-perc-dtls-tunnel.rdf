    <title>"DTLS Tunnel between a Media Distributor and Key Distributor to Facilitate Key Exchange", Paul Jones, Paul Ellenbogen, Nils Ohlmeier</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jones-perc-dtls-tunnel-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Distributor. The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the media distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the media distributor.</description>
