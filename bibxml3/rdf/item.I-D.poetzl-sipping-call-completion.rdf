    <description>This document specifies the extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for the call completion services provided in the context of ETSI Next Generation Networks (NGN). Therefore this document describes a SIP event package that enables subscribing to and managing call completion queues. Furthermore this document extends the usage of the Allows-events header field to 180 Ringing and 486 Busy responses, and specifies an indication used for the prioritization of call-completion calls.</description>
