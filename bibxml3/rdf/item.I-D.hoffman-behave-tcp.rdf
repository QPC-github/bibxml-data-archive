    <title>"NAT Behavioral Requirements for Unicast TCP", Saikat Guha</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-behave-tcp-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs that handle TCP that would allow many applications, such as peer-to-peer applications and on-line games, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that these applications will function properly.</description>
