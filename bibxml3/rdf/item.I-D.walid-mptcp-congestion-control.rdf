    <description>This document describes the mechanism of Balia, the "Balanced linked adaptation", which is a congestion control algorithm for Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  The recent proposals, LIA and OLIA, suffer from either unfriendliness to Single Path TCP (SPTCP) or unresponsiveness to network changes under certain conditions.  The tradeoff between friendliness and responsiveness is inevitable, but Balia judiciously balances this tradeoff based on a new design framework that allows one to systematically explore the design space.  Balia has been implemented in the Linux kernel and also included in the UCLouvain's MPTCP implementation.</description>
