    <description>In accompany with the migration of a Virtual Machine (VM), state associated with the VM located on the Hypervisors and the network side devices (e.g., Firewalls) need to be updated in order to guarantee that the services executed on the migrated VM will not be disrupted.  VM vendors have their own ways to migrate VM's state on Hypervisors, and so this is out the scope of this draft.This draft introduces the background of state migration on network devices using several application scenarios and tries to specify a clear scope for the future standardization work on state migration on network devices.</description>
