    <description>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource-constrained nodes and networks, e.g., sensor nodes in low-power lossy networks (LLNs). Still, to implement this Internet protocol on Class 1 devices, i.e., ~10KiB of RAM and ~100KiB of ROM, light-weight implementation techniques are necessary. This document provides the lessons learned from implementing CoAP for Contiki, an operating system for tiny, battery-operated networked embedded systems. The information may become part of the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance document planned by the IETF working group LWIG.</description>
