        <description>This draft defines extensions to BGP-LS protocol in order to advertise Network Resource Partition SR segments that share the same IGP computed forwarding path but offer a forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling and drop policy) that is associated with a specific Network Resource.  The draft is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 dataplanes</description>
