    <title>"Network Design Complexity Measurement and Tradeoffs", Alvaro Retana, Russ White</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-irtf-ncrg-network-design-complexity-00.txt</link>
    <description>Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what network will best fit these needs?"  A part of fitting network design to requirements is the problem of complexity, an idea often informally measured using intuition and subjective experience.  When would adding a particular protocol, policy, or configuration be "too complex?"  This document suggests a series of continuums along which network complexity might be measured.  No suggestions are made on how to measure complexity for each of these continuums; this is left for future documents.</description>
