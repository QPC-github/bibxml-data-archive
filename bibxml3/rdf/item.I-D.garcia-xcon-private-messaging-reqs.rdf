    <description>The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for sending session-based instant messages. The session is negotiated using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). MSRP can be used in a centralized conference just as any other media type. This document provides requirements in support for MSRP in centralized conferences, including requirements to provide private instant messages within a conference.</description>
