    <title>"CoAP Protocol Negotiation", Bill Silverajan, Mert Ocak</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-silverajan-core-coap-protocol-negotiation-09.txt</link>
    <description>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol.  When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource representations, this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate transport and protocol configurations as well as URIs for CoAP messaging.  Several mechanisms are proposed: Extending the CoRE Resource Directory with new parameter types, introducing a new CoAP Option with which clients can interact directly with servers without needing the Resource Directory, and finally a new CoRE Link Attribute allowing exposing alternate locations on a per-resource basis.</description>
