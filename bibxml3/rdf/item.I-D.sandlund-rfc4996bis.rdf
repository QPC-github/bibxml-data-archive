    <title>"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): A Profile for TCP/IP (ROHC-TCP)", Ghyslain Pelletier, Kristofer Sandlund, Mark West, Lars-Erik Jonsson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sandlund-rfc4996bis-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for compression of TCP/IP packets.  The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient and robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP options such as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments) and Timestamps.  ROHC-TCP works well when used over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times.  For many bandwidth-limited links where header compression is essential, such characteristics are common.  This specification obsoletes [RFC4996].  It fixes a technical issue with the SACK compression and clarifies other compression methods used.</description>
