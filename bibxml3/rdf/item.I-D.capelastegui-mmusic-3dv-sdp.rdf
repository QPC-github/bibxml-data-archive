    <title>"3D Video in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)", Pedro Capelastegui</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-capelastegui-mmusic-3dv-sdp-00.pdf</link>
    <description>This document defines a mechanism to describe 3D video streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  This includes 3D video streams composed of multiple video views, or of a combination of views and depth maps.  Several 3D video formats are supported, including simulcast, video-plus-depth, and frame-packing.  A new decoding dependency, "3dd", is defined, describing the association between media stream belonging to a 3D video stream.  In addition, a new SDP media-level attribute, "3dvFormat", is defined, describing the format used by media streams within a 3D video stream.</description>
