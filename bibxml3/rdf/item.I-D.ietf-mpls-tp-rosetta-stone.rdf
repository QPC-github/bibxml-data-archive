    <description>MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS and Pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS-TE, PW and Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) architectures developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).  The International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has specified a Transport Network architecture.  This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP terminology within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network Recommendations.  It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of contexts than just Transport Networks.  The definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations of MPLS-TP concepts.  This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms to be applied within the Transport Network context.</description>
