    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-sip-tote-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a simple protocol - Trivial Object Transfer and Exchange (TOTE) - that provides bidirectional exchange of MIME objects over a TCP connection.  It is used in conjunction with protocols based on the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  TOTE can be used for any application requiring direct agent-to-agent data communication, such as picture exchange or camera controls.</description>
