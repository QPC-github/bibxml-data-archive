    <description>In line with the HTTP compatibility goal for HTTP 2.0, HTTP 2.0 must also be compatible with currently deployed authentication schemes. This draft addresses this goal in the presence of multiplexing (expected to be part of HTTP 2.0), while addressing some of the issues currently encountered when performing multilegged authentication.</description>
