    <description>IPv6 has some interesting differences if compared to IPv4. Among the others, it has been developed to restore the end-to-end transparency of the Internet, it offers effective functionalities to support end- nodes configuration phases, and it offers many features that are implemented in IPv4 as add-ons. With such a foundation, IPv6 appears as an ideal playground for developing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications that rely by design on the interaction between end nodes. The purpose of this document is to attract participation within the P2Pv6 research group, in order to establish a coordinated and proficient research about the joint usage of p2p frameworks and the IPv6 protocol.</description>
