    <title>"RFC Editor Model (Version 2)", Olaf Kolkman, Joel Halpern</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-rfc-editor-model-v2-05.txt</link>
    <description>The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: The RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained with RFC Editor Model version 1, documented in [RFC5620] and obsoletes that document.</description>
