    <title>"Using DNS SRV to Specify a Global File Name Space with NFS version 4", Craig  Everhart, Andy Adamson, Jiaying Zhang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-everhart-nfsv4-namespace-via-dns-srv-03.txt</link>
    <description>The NFS version 4 protocol provides a natural way for a collection of NFS file servers to collaborate in providing an organization-wide file name space.  The DNS SRV RR allows a simple and appropriate way for an organization to publish the root of its name space, even to clients that might not be intimately associated with such an organization.  DNS SRV can be used to join these organization-wide file name spaces together to allow construction of a global, uniform NFS version 4 file name space.  This document refreshes the draft.</description>
