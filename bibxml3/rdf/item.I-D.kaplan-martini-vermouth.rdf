    <description>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX type devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address of Records, using the GIN mechanism defined in [draft-gin]. Two other drafts, [draft-olive] and [draft-glass], propose the same for non-E.164-based AoRs.  This document defines a means by which the IP-PBX can verify the resolution entries in the SSP for open- ended or full AoRs of any GIN-based mechanism, using a new Event- Package named "vermouth".</description>
