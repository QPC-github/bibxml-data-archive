    <description>Software-defined networking (SDN) is emerging and intensively discussed as one of the most promising technologies to provide centralized, programmable control planes for network service providers (NSPs). In this sense, SDN could be also considered as one of candidates to facilitate CDNI Request Routing. This document discusses how SDN can be used for downstream CDN selection within CDNI request routing.</description>
