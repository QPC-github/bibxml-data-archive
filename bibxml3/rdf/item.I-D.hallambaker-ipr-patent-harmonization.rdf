    <title>"IETF Patent Policy: A Quantum Approach", Phillip Hallam-Baker, Daniel  Weitzner</title>

    <description>Considerations for IETF patent policy are considered and proposals made for reform.  The particular objective of these proposals is to reduce the amount of time spent in unproductive discussion of IPR issues and to allow Working Groups to provide Patent Rights Holders with clearly defined criteria that must be met in order for their technology to be accepted.</description>
