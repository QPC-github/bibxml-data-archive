    <description>[SW-MESH-FMWK] provides a generalized framework to connect islands of various network layer protocols over a backbone network composed of same or different network layer protocol routers. To this end, packets sourced from the islands are forwarded over a signaled softwire in the backbone network by encapsulating the packets in a softwire transport header. This document define a new BGP attribute called the "Softwire Mesh Encasulation attribute" that are advertised by the softwire mesh endpoints to build these transport headers.</description>
