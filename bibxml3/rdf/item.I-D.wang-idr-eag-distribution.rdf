    <description>As MPLS-TE network grows, administrative Groups advertised as a fixed-length 32-bit Bitmask is quite constraining.  "Extended Administrative Group" IGP TE extensions sub-TLV defined in [RFC7308] is introduced to provide for additional administrative groups (link colors) beyond the current limit of 32.  This document describes extensions to BGP protocol, that can be used to distribute extended administrative groups in MPLS-TE.</description>
