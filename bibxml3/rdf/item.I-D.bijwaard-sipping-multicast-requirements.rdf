    <description>Multicast support in the Offer/Answer Model for SDP is mainly focussed on receiving and not on sending multicast streams, it assumes usage of the service announcement protocol for multicast sessions which is hardly in use.  In this document requirements are described to enable multicast sessions with a group of users, switching session parts between unicast and multicast, and sessions containing both unicast and multicast streams.</description>
