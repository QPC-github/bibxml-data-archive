    <description>RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:  The source code and issues list for this draft can be found in https://github.com/hstenn/ietf-ntp-extended-information-ef  The core network packet used by NTP has no spare bits available for reporting additional state information and no larger data areas available for larger amounts of information.  This proposal offers a new extension field that would contain this additional information.</description>
