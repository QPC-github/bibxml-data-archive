    <title>"A UDP/IP Adaptation of the ZigBee Application Protocol", Gilman Tolle</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tolle-cap-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a UDP/IP adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4- based ZigBee Application Protocol that enables IP hosts to communicate using the application profiles and data models described by that protocol, over a wide range of links.  This modified version of the ZigBee Application Protocol is named CAP (Compact Application Protocol), and it is intended to provide a complete stack of application profiles, data exchange, binding operations, security protocols, and discovery to IP-networked hosts and embedded devices. The protocol's domain of applicability includes IEEE 802.15.4-based 6LoWPAN devices, but also those on conventional wired and wireless links and emerging powerline communication networks.</description>
