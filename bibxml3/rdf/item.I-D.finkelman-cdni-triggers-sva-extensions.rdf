    <description>The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video Alliance is focused on the delegation of video delivery request from commercial CDNs to a caching layer at the ISP.  In that aspect, Open Caching is a specific use case of CDNI, where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN). The extensions specified in this document to the CDNI CI/T interface are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</description>
