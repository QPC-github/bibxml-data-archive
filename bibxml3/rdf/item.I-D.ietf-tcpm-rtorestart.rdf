    <description>This document describes a modified sender-side algorithm for managing the TCP and SCTP retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when there is a small amount of outstanding data for a connection.  The modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport to restart its retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that the effective RTO becomes more aggressive in situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.  This enables faster loss detection and recovery for connections that are short-lived or application-limited.</description>
