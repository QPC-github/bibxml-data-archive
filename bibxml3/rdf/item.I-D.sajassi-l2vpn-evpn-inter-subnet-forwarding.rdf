    <description>EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution for intra-subnet connectivity among hosts/VMs over an MPLS/IP network. However, there are scenarios in which inter-subnet forwarding among hosts/VMs across different IP subnets is required, while maintaining the multi-homing capabilities of EVPN. This document describes an Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution based on EVPN to address such requirements.</description>
