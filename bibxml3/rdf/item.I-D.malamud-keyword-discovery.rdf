    <title>"Attaching Meaning to Solicitation Class Keywords", Carl Malamud</title>

    <description>This Internet-Draft proposes a mechanism for finding a URI associated with a solicitation class keyword, which is defined in RFC 3865, the No Soliciting SMTP Service Extension. Solicitation class keywords are simple labels consisting of a domain name that has been reversed, such as "org.example.adv". These solicitation class keywords are inserted in selected header fields or used in the ESMTP service extension, including a new "No-Solicit:" header which can contain one or more solicitation class keywords inserted by the sender.</description>
