    <description>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their sites are connected via a Local Area Network (LAN).  It is often required for the Service Provider (SP) to give the customer redundant connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".  This memo shows how multi-homing can be offered in the context of LDP-based VPLS using BGP-AD.</description>
