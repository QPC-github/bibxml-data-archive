    <description>When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, two steps are necessary.  The first is to secure the routing protocols' packets on the wire.  The second is to ensure that the keying material for the routing protocol exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate routers.  This document specifies requirements on that distribution and proposes the use of a set of protocols to achieve those requirements.</description>
