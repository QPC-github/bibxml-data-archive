    <description>In Layer 2 Access Networks, Access Concentrators are present between DHCP Clients and Relay Agent. In this case, the Relay Agent can not uniquely identify the end host and hence can not add unique 'Relay Agent Information' option corresponding to the end hosts in DHCP messages. As the Access concentrators are closer to the end hosts, they can uniquely identify the end hosts and add the Relay Agent Information option in the DHCP message. Access concentrators do not set the 'giaddr' field. Access Concentrators in this mode are typically known as Layer 2 Relay agents. This document provides insight to the behavior of the Access Concentrators which act as DHCP Layer 2 Relay Agents in Access Networks.</description>
