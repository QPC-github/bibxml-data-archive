    <description>This document lays out a set of requirements related to integrity protection over the headers for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). While mechanism such as SIP-Identity and S/MIME may be used to provide integrity protection between the end-points, it can not provide integrity protections over some of the headers which may benefit from having an integrity protection.</description>
