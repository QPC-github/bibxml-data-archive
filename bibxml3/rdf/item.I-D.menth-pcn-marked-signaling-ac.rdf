    <title>"Admission Control Using PCN-Marked Signaling", Michael Menth, Ruediger Geib</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-menth-pcn-marked-signaling-ac-00.txt</link>
    <description>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC5559.  This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain.  This document proposes an admission control method.  It assumes that PCN nodes perform threshold-marking configured with the PCN- admissible-rate on any link.  The PCN marking state of an initial signaling message of a flow is used to determine whether the flow should be admitted or blocked.</description>
