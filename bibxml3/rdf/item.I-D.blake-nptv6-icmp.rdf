    <title>"ICMP Handling in IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation", Steven Blake, Terry Moes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-blake-nptv6-icmp-02.txt</link>
    <description>NPTv6 is a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation function that provides the address-independence benefit associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT without some of that mechanism's drawbacks.  NPTv6 is intended to be deployed in environments where a host might not know its "external" network prefix(es).  In such an environment, a NPTv6 device must also translate network prefixes present in in-bound and out-bound ICMPv6 error message payloads. This document describes the required processing of ICMPv6 error messages.</description>
