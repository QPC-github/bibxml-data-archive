    <description>Consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue of its connectionless pull-based communication model; producer mobility though is not natively supported.  This document describes MAP-Me, an anchor-less solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers in the CCN (Content Centric Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) architectures, with support for latency-sensitive applications.  MAP- Me consists in the combination of two data plane protocols, triggered by producer movements, and leveraging ICN named-based data plane. The main protocol consists in a lightweight FIB update process, complemented by a mechanism of local notification and scoped discovery suitable for low latency applications and fast mobility.</description>
