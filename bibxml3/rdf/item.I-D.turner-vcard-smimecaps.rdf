    <description>This document defines a vCard S/MIME Capabilities property and it defines or references values for many algorithms. The SMIME Capability values can also be included in S/MIME messages as a signed attribute and in public key certificates as an extension. The S/MIME Capabilities property is a complement to key property, which together enable usage of S/MIME without an initial exchange of email messages.</description>
