    <description>Segment routing uses source routing paradigm to traffic engineering by specifying segments a packet traverses through the network.  MPLS Segment Routing applies that paradigm to an MPLS data plane-based networks.  SR-MPLS over IP uses MPLS label stack as a source routing instruction set and uses IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in- UDP as defined in RFC 7510 to realize a source routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes.  This document describes Operations, Administration, and Maintenance operations in SR-MPLS over IP environment.</description>
