    <description>The continued growth of large-scale data centers has resulted in a wide range of architectures and designs.  Each design is tuned to address the challenges and requirements of the specific applications and workload that the data is being built for.  Each design evolves as engineering solutions are developed to workaround limitations of existing protocols, hardware, as well as software implementations.  The goal of this document is to characterize this problem space in detail in order to better understand if there is any gap in making address resolution scale in various network designs for data centers.  In particular it is our goal to peel back the various optimization and engineering solutions to develop generalized reference architectures for a data center.  We also discuss the various factors that influence design choices in developing various data center designs.</description>
