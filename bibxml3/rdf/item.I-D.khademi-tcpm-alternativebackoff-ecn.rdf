    <description>This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The updated method reduces FlightSize in Congestion Avoidance by a smaller amount than the TCP reaction to loss.  The intention is to achieve good throughput when the queue at the bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product of the connection.  This is more likely when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has used ECN to CE-mark a packet, than when a packet was lost.  Future versions of this document will also describe a corresponding method for SCTP.</description>
