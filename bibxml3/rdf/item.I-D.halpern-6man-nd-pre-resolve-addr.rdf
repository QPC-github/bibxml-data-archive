    <title>"Triggering ND Address Resolution on Receiving DAD-NS", Ing-Wher Chen, Joel Halpern</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-halpern-6man-nd-pre-resolve-addr-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft proposes a new optional event to trigger address resolution using IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.  This helps optimize router performance, and can help mitigate certain potential ND-related denial-of-service attacks.  Upon receiving a DAD-NS message, the neighbor solicitation message used to detect duplicate addresses, if the target address encoded in the DAD-NS is not a duplicate address, the receiving device responds by triggering address resolution for the target address in the DAD-NS, in preparation for expectant future communication with the sending device.</description>
