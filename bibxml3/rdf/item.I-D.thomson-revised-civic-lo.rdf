    <title>"Revised Civic Location Format for PIDF-LO", Martin Thomson, James  Winterbottom</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-revised-civic-lo-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic location. This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents. The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for DHCP. The format also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of elements where appropriate.</description>
