    <description>Multiple virtual machines (VMs) created in a single physical platform Or vServer greatly improve the efficiency of data centers by enabling more work from less hardware.  Multiple vServer and associated virtual machines work together as one cluster make good use of resources of each vServer that are scattered into different data centers or vServers.  VMs have their lifecycles from VM creation, VM Power on to VM Power off and VM deletion.  The VMs may also move across the participating virtualization hosts (e.g., the virtualization server, hypervisor).  This document discusses how VMs, vServers and overlay network are managed by leveraging control plane function and management plane function and desired signaling functionalities for Network Virtualization Overlay.</description>
