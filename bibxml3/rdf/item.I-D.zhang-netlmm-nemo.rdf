    <description>The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network- based localized mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for registration, de-registration and handover of single Mobile Node (MN) into account in the RFC 5213 [1]. When a whole subnet moves into the PMIPv6 domain through the Mobile Router (MR), the scheme should be considered to provide and maintain the connectivity for the Mobile Network Node (MNN) in the mobile network (NEMO). This document discusses the deployment consideration of NEMO support in PMIPv6 network and proposes the possible solution accordingly.</description>
