    <description>Ethernet Virtual Private Networks (EVPN) is becoming the de-facto standard-based control plane solution for Data Center and layer-2 Service Provider applications. The risk of loops caused by backdoor paths accidentally created within the same broadcast domain, is a general common concern, especially among Service Providers in large Layer-2 networks. While other layer-2 Ethernet technologies use Spanning Tree based Protocols (xSTP) to provide a network-wide loop protection, EVPN has the right tools to detect and protect the network against loops in an efficient and effective way. This document describes a mechanism to provide global loop protection in EVPN networks.</description>
