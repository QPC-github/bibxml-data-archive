    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node with no mobility management protocol.  It makes it appear to the mobile node that its IP address does not change as the mobile node moves across the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  There have been some issues identified with supporting a host with multiple interfaces attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  This document describes and analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this.</description>
