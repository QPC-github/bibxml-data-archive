    <title>"Passive Duplicate Address Detection for On-demand Routing Protocols", HongJong Jeong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jeong-autoconf-pdad-on-demand-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes passive DAD techniques over on-demand ad-hoc routing protocols such as AODV and DYMO. In order to achieve these two goals: (a) improving the accuracy of detecting address conflicts and (b) reducing the time taken to detect these conflicts, this document provides several techniques using additional information including sequence, location, or neighbor knowledge.</description>
