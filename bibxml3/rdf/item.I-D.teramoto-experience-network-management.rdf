    <description>This document describes our experiences from designing and implementing a large-scale local area network management system using mainly NETCONF.  We designed the data models for device configurations and implemented NETCONF client to centrally control multiple devices of various vendors.  The document provides insight on strong and weak points of current NETCONF approach.  The document also makes some recommendations about NETCONF and future network management protocols.</description>
