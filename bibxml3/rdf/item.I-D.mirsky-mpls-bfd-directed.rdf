    <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor bi- directional paths.  When a BFD session monitors in its forward direction an explicitly routed path there is a need to be able to direct egress BFD peer to use specific path as reverse direction of the BFD session.</description>
