    <title>"Mobile IPv6 Make Before Break", Robert Jaksa</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jaksa-mn-mbb-01.txt</link>
    <description>This draft documents the use of MCoA (Multiple Care-of Address) method defined in [4] in order to facilitate a Make Before Break within the Mobile IPv6 protocol [1] . This draft is intended to document the usage of MCoA for achieving Make Before Break behavior. The current base Mobile IPv6 specification [1] doesn't include MCoA. With that draft currently under consideration it is possible to use these extensions for MBB.</description>
