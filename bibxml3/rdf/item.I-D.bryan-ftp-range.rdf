    <title>"File Transfer Protocol RANG Command for Octet Ranges", Anthony Bryan, Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa, Daniel Stenberg, Tim Kosse</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bryan-ftp-range-08.txt</link>
    <description>The File Transfer Protocol offers the REST command to designate a starting point for a transfer, but does not currently offer any method to specify an end point.  This document specifies a new FTP RANG command to be used by clients to designate an octet range to a file, including a start and end point.  This range can be used to permit restarts and repairs of interrupted data transfers in STREAM mode, among other things.</description>
