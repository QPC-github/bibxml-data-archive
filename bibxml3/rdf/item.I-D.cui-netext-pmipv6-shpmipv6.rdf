    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provide a mobile node(MN) which requires no additional modification to MN with IP mobility.  Fast Handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FHPMIPv6), specified in[RFC5949], proposed two modes of fast handover, both of them use single interface to transmate packets during handover, which requires it to buffer packets in MAGs when interface performs handover. Buffer packets in MAGs result in additional overhead, and increase packets transmission delay.  Unlike FHPMIPv6, this document proposed a seamless handover scheme for multi-access mobile node with IP mobility when one of MN's network interface performs handover from one MAG to another.  This scheme uses some other interface of the multi-access mobile node to help process packets while handovering.</description>
