    <description>This document proposes a centralized DF Designated Forwarder election mechanism to be used between an SDN (Software Defined Network) controller and each PE (Provider Edge) device in an EVPN network. Such a mechanism overcomes some issues with the current standalone DF election defined in RFC 7432. A new BGP capability and an additional DF Election Result Route Type are specified to support this centralized DF election mechanism.</description>
