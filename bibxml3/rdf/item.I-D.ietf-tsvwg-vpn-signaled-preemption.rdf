    <title>"QoS Signaling in a Nested Virtual Private Network", Fred Baker, Pratik Bose</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tsvwg-vpn-signaled-preemption-02.txt</link>
    <description>Some networks require communication between an interior and exterior portion of a VPN or through a concatenation of such networks resulting in a nested VPN, but have sensitivities about what information is communicated across the boundary, especially while providing quality of service to communications with different precedence. This note seeks to outline the issues and the nature of the proposed solutions based on the framework for Integrated Services operation over DiffServ networks as described in RFC 2998 .</description>
