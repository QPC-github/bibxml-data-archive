    <title>"Building Power-Efficient CoAP Devices for Cellular Networks", Jari Arkko, Anders Eriksson, Ari Keranen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-arkko-lwig-cellular-01.txt</link>
    <description>This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ cellular networks as a communications medium.  Building communicating devices that employ these networks is obviously well known, but this memo focuses specifically on techniques necessary to minimize power consumption.</description>
