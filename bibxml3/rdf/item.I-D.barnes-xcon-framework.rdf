    <title>"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing", Mary Barnes, Chris  Boulton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-xcon-framework-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON), which is applicable to participants using different call control signaling protocols and exchanging media over networks with potentially different characteristics. The XCON Framework defines the XCON data model, the XCON logical entities, the naming conventions, and outlines the standard conferencing protocols (complementary to the call control signalling protocols) for building advanced conferencing applications. The framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit of conferencing system builders.</description>
