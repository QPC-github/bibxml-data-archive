    <title>"Media Independent Pre-authentication supporting fast-handoff in PMIPv6", Kenichi Taniuchi</title>

    <description>This document describes a proactive mechanism to provide fast- handover involving PMIPv6. In particular, it describes how one can achieve fast handoff for PMIPv6 using Media-independent Pre- Authentication (MPA) technique. It discusses the need for a fast- handoff for PMIPv6 environment. It then describes how MPA techniques could be used during different steps involving both intra-domain and inter-domain handoff for PMIPv6. MPA-based fast-handover takes advantage of the pre-authentication mechanism so that the mobile can perform the access authentication while in the previous local mobility (PMA) domain and thus would be able to complete many of the handoff related operations while still in the previous network.</description>
