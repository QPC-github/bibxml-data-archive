    <description>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  DTLS over SCTP provides communications privacy for applications that use SCTP as its transport protocol and allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.  Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions.</description>
