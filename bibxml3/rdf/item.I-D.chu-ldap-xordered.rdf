    <title>"Ordered Entries and Values in LDAP", Howard Chu</title>

    <description>As LDAP is used more extensively for managing various kinds of data, one often encounters a need to preserve both the ordering and the content of data, despite the inherently unordered structure of entries and attribute values in the directory. This document describes a scheme to attach ordering information to attributes in a directory so that the ordering may be preserved and propagated to other LDAP applications.</description>
