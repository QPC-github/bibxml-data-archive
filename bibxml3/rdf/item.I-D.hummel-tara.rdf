    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hummel-tara-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like to call TARA = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primary objective is to eliminate the so-called scalability problem as proclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming the true causes of this problem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms - it may serve as the base for much better routing.</description>
