    <title>"A Pseudo-Protocol for BGP Next Hop Cost Manipulation", Jon Mitchell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mitchell-rtgwg-pseudo-bgp-nh-cost-00.txt</link>
    <description>This describes a local router implementation option that provides a facility for the manipulation of the costs of IGP learned routes that are utilized as BGP NextHops rather than using the SPF calculated cost to the same route when running the BGP path selection algorithm. The result is something that works like a pseudo-routing protocol but only impacting the BGP decision making process.</description>
