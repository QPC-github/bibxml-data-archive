    <description>This document describes IKEv2 peer authentication via IPv6 Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA). This techincque have been proposed to solve several security issues in the absence of any centralized trusted security infrastructure and without any pre- arrangements, to provide IPSec self-evident authentication mode between IPv6 nodes or security gateways.</description>
