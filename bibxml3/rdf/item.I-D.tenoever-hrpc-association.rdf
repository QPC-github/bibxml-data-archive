    <description>This document scopes the relation between Internet protocols and the right to freedom of assembly and association.  Increasingly, the Internet mediates our lives, our relationships and our ability to exercise our human rights.  The Internet provides a global public space, but one that is built predominantly on private infrastructure. Since Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development and use of the Internet, the relation between protocols and the aforementioned rights should be documented and any adverse impacts of this relation should be mitigated.</description>
