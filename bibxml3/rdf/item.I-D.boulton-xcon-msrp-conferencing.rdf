    <description>The document "A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing" defines a centralized conference as both signaling and protocol agnostic. The primary examples within this framework focus on audio and video as the media types for the session. This document describes the mechanisms, in the context of this centralized conferencing framework, when using instant messaging sessions as the media.</description>
