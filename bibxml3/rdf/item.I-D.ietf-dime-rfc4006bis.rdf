    <description>This document specifies a Diameter application that can be used to implement real-time credit-control for a variety of end user services such as network access, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services, messaging services, and download services.  The Diameter Credit- Control application as defined in this document obsoletes RFC4006, and it must be supported by all new Diameter Credit-Control Application implementations.</description>
