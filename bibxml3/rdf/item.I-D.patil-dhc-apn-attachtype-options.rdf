    <description>Access Point Names are used in wireless networks which are based on 3GPP standards to identify a specific gateway element.  A mobile node which attaches via a 3GPP access network indicates the gateway to which connectivity is desired by providing the gateways access point name, in the network attach signaling messages.  This document specifies a new DHCP option which enables the mobile node to request connectivity to a gateway, identified by the access point name, in DHCP messages.  A mobile node whose mobility is managed by the network using Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol may perform a handover from one access technology to another.  This document defines a DHCP option which enables the host to indicate to Proxy Mobile IPv6 elements in the access network if the attachment via the new interface is a handover or a new connection.</description>
