    <description>With 4K technology, we can get more details compared to traditional HD screens of the same size.  However, 4K content increases the demand for higher network throughput, which poses a big challenge for delivering 4K content by TCP.  This document proposes a target throughput based method for increasing TCP's congestion window (cwnd).  Experimental results show that the proposed method can reach the required throughput much more rapidly than traditional TCP congestion algorithms, such as Reno, Cubic.  Moreover, this method prevents cwnd from increasing when cwnd reaching to the required throughput.</description>
