    <title>"OCSP Extensions to IKEv2", Michael Myers, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-myers-ipsec-ikev2-oscp-02.txt</link>
    <description>While IKEv2 supports public key based authentication (PKI), the corresponding use of in-band CRLs is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an OCSP response is however well-bounded and small. This document defines two extensions to IKEv2 which enable the use of OCSP for in-band signaling of certificate revocation status. Two new content encodings are defined for use in the CERTREQ and CERT payloads: OCSP Responder Hash and OCSP Response. An OCSP Responder Hash CERTREQ payload triggers transmission of an OCSP Response CERT payload.</description>
