    <description>In this draft, we propose some protocol requirements for mobility in LowPAN networks within the context of the IETF LowPAN working group (IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4). To achieve mobility in LowPAN networks, there may be inter-domain movement of network elements across different LowPAN domains or across domains that do not comprise LowPAN autonomous systems. To address routing issues in inter-domain LowPAN networks that conform to fitting within a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame, there are needs for collaborative and distributed methodologies for route computation, information storage and retrieval, and security issues in protocols targeted to LowPAN mobility. This draft proposes some requirements of mobility in LowPAN protocols from the perspective of protocol-independent metrics, algorithm complexities, scalability and security criteria.</description>
