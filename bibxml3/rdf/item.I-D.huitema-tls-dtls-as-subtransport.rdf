    <title>"DTLS as Subtransport protocol", Christian Huitema, Eric Rescorla, Jana</title>

    <description>The developers of "user level" transports will benefit from a standard implementation of authentication and encryption.  This can be achieved using DTLS as a sub-transport.  Using DTLS enables developers to benefit from the investment in TLS, and removes the burden and the risks of re-creating similar technology.  There are several requirements to ensure that DTLS is a suitable sub- transport: zero RTT setup, low overhead, and DOS prevention.  The IAB SEMI workshop outlined other potential requirements: start/stop indication, and ability to accept indications from the network.  The draft presents guidelines for meeting these requirements in a new version of DTLS.</description>
