        <description>This document provides an analysis of the applicability of the YANG models defined by the IETF (in particular in the Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS) and Common Control and Measurement Plane (CCAMP) working groups) to support ODU transit services, transparent client services, and Ethernet Private Line/Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EPL/EVPL) services over Optical Transport Network (OTN) in single and multi-domain network scenarios.  This document also describes how existing YANG models can be used through several worked examples and JSON fragments.</description>
