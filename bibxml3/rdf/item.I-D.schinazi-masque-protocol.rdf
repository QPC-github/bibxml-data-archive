        <description>This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a framework that allows concurrently running multiple networking applications inside an HTTP/3 connection.  For example, MASQUE can allow a QUIC client to negotiate proxying capability with an HTTP/3 server, and subsequently make use of this functionality while concurrently processing HTTP/3 requests and responses.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.</description>
