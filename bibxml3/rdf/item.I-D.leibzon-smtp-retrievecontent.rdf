    <title>"SMTP Extension for Advertisement of External-Body Content Retrieval  Capability", William Leibzon</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-leibzon-smtp-retrievecontent-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an ESMTP extension by means of which mail agents can report capability to retreive message content from remote location specified with MIME/External-Body type. This allows to save senders from having to send data for content parts that may not be of interest to the recipient and is especially useful when content is available in several alternative formats or languages and its not known which one recipient prefers.</description>
