    <title>"TCP Candidates with Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)", Jonathan Rosenberg, Ari Keranen, Bruce Lowekamp, Adam Roach</title>

    <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework for describing candidates, but only defines UDP-based media streams. This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream.</description>
