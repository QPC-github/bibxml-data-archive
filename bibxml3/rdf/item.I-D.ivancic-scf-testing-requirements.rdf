    <description>This document provides guidelines and requirements for testing Store, Carry and Forward (SCF) systems and protocols.  The Testing Requirements document is one of three that fully describe the SCF system.  The other two are the SCF Problem Statement and the SCF Requirements and Expectations document.  This initial document is currently just a skeletal outline, published so the other two SCF documents can reference it.</description>
