    <title>"Why do we need passive measurement of round trip time?", Brian Trammell</title>

    <description>This document describes the utility of passive two-way latency measurement, both for the generation of latency metrics, as well as for other measurement tasks, when passive latency measurement is the only facility available for measurement.  It additionally discusses other metrics derivable from the transport-independent latency spin signal defined in [TSVWG-SPIN].</description>
