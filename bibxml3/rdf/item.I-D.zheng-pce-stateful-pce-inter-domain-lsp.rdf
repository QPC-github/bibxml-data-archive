    <description>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains the information of Label Switched Path (LSP) and resource availability within a domain. Multiple stateful PCEs are able to provide traffic engineering inter-domain LSPs through cooperating with each other.  This document introduces the applicability of cooperative stateful PCE for establishing inter-domain inter-vendor LSPs which are initiated by PCE.</description>
