    <title>"Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating  Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)", Vishwas Manral</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-manral-ipsec-rfc4305-bis-errata-03.txt</link>
    <description>The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security services. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data being sent over an IPsec Security Association (SA). To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to- implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.</description>
