    <title>"Specifying Alternate Semantics for the Explicit Congestion Notification  (ECN) Field", Sally Floyd</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-ecn-alternates-02.ps</link>
    <description>There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for the ECN field in the IP header [ECN]. This document discusses some of the issues in defining alternate semantics for the ECN field, and specifies requirements for a safe co-existence in an Internet that could include routers that do not understand the defined alternate semantics. This document evolved as a result of discussions with the authors of one recent proposal for such alternate semantics.</description>
