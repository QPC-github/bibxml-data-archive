    <description>The Optimized Mobile IPv6 with CGA (OMIPv6-CGA) protocol specifies a new route optimization (RO) to solve the mobility problem. Privacy extensions for OMIPv6 adds anonymity and unlinkability support to the OMIPv6-CGA protocol. This document combines OMIPv6-CGA including its privacy extension with support for multi-homing. As such, it offers an efficient and secure multi-homing and mobility support for MIPv6 using CGAs including privacy support.</description>
