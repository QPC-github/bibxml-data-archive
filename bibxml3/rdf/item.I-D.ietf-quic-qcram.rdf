    <title>"Header Compression for HTTP over QUIC", Charles Krasic, Mike Bishop, Alan Frindell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-qcram-00.txt</link>
    <description>The design of the core QUIC transport subsumes many HTTP/2 features, prominent among them stream multiplexing.  A key advantage of the QUIC transport is stream multiplexing free of head-of-line (HoL) blocking between streams.  In HTTP/2, multiplexed streams can suffer HoL blocking due to TCP.  If HTTP/2's HPACK is used for header compression, HTTP/QUIC is still vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of HPACK's assumption of in-order delivery.  This draft defines QCRAM, a variation of HPACK and mechanisms in the HTTP/QUIC mapping that allow the flexibility to avoid header-compression-induced HoL blocking.</description>
