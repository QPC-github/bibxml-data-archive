    <title>"Policy Guided Prefixes with Routing In Fat Trees", Alia Atlas, Zhaohui Zhang</title>

    <description>In a fat tree, it can be sometimes desirable to guide traffic to particular destinations or keep specific flows to certain paths.  In RIFT, this traffic steering/engineering is done by using policy- guided prefixes with their associated communities.  Routes based on policy-guided prefixes are preferred over regular routes.  Any node can originate a policy-guided prefix and advertise it in both north and south directions, and the calculation in both directions are distance vector based.</description>
