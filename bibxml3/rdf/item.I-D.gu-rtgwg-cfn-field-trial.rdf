    <description>Compute First Networking (CFN) enables the routing of the service request to an optimal edge site to improve the overall system load balancing and efficiency. Especially when an edge site is overloaded, other edges with service equivalency can dynamically serve the request. This document describes a CFN field trial to show the effect that CFN can achieve. Edge to edge interaction to get the available computing resources information for services and the network status to each other is introduced. Data plane to support late binding based dynamic anycast is illustrated too. The field trial shows that CFN can greatly improve the overall query per second served for a service hosted on multiple edges in a more balanced way.</description>
