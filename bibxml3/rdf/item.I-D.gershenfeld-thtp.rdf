    <description>THTP, the Trivial Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an implementation of HTTP over UDP transport. THTP is designed for environments with limited computational power or bandwidth and single-packet exchanges. As such, THTP is best suited for the emerging class of applications running on embedded devices and sensor networks. THTP decouples HTTP from TCP and provides a subset of HTTP's functionality, in particular leveraging HTTP's URI naming scheme. This document describes the THTP protocol.</description>
