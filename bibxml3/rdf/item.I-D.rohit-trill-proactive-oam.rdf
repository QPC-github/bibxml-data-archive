    <description>Pro-active fault monitoring for TRILL monitors all the paths between any two given RBridges in the network. Number of paths to be monitored can be of exponential order based on the distance between two RBridges. In this document novel fault monitoring mechanism based on a distributed approach is presented.</description>
