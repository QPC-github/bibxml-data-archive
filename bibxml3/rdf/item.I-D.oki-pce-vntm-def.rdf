    <description>A network may be built from multiple layers that may be technology- specific divisions, or may be administrative divisions. It is important to globally optimize network resource utilization, taking into account all layers, rather than optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows better network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter- layer traffic engineering (TE). The Virtual Network Topology (VNT) is defined as the network topology formed by lower-layer LSPs and advertised to the higher layer as TE links. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering, but requires a separate function to manage and control the VNT. This document defines the VNT Manager (VNTM), which manages and controls the VNT for PCE-based inter-layer traffic engineering.</description>
