    <title>"A Framework for IP and MPLS Fast Reroute Using Not-via Addresses", Stewart Bryant, Stefano Previdi, Mike Shand</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses-11.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast reroute in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to "not-via" addresses.  The general approach described uses a single level of encapsulation and could be used to protect unicast, multicast, and LDP traffic against link, router, and shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.  The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document of record.  Further work is needed before implementation or deployment.</description>
