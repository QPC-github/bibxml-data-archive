    <title>"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Authentication Using  Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) Version-2", Vesa Torvinen, Jari Arkko, Mats Naslund</title>

    <description>HTTP Digest as specified in [4] is known to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if the client fails to authenticate the server in TLS, or if the same passwords are used for authentication in some other context without TLS. This is a general problem that exist not just with HTTP Digest but also with other IETF protocols that use tunneled authentication. This document specifies version 2 of the HTTP Digest AKA algorithm [6]. This algorithm can be implemented in a way that it is resistant to the man-in-the-middle attack.</description>
