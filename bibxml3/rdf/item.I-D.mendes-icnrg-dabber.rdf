    <description>This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER) protocol.  DABBER aims to provide a name-based routing solution to support the operation of Information-centric Networking frameworks in opportunistic wireless networks.  By "opportunistic wireless networks" it is meant multi-hop wireless networks where finding an end-to-end path between any pair of nodes at any moment in time may be a challenge.  The goal is to assist in better defining opportunities for the transmission of Interest packets in a store- carry-and-forward manner, based on a proactive approach.  The document describes how to integrate DABBER in a networking node that implements some ICN approach, such as Named-Data Networking (NDN) or Content Centric Networking (CCN), along with the specification of the proactive approach based on the dissemination of name-prefix information.</description>
