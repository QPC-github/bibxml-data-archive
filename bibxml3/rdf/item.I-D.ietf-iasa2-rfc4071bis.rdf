    <description>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative structure.  The purpose of this document is to document and describe the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2 (IASA 2.0).  It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF Administration LLC Board.  This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.</description>
