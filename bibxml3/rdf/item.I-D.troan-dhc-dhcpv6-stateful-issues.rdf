    <title>"Issues with multiple stateful DHCPv6 options", Ole Troan, Bernie Volz</title>

    <description>[RFC3315] was not written with the expectation that other stateful DHCPv6 options would be developed.  [RFC3633] shoe-horned the new options for Prefix Delegation options for DHCPv6 into DHCPv6. Implementation experience of the CPE model described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.</description>
