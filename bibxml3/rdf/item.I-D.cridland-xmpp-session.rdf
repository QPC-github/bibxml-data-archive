    <title>"Here Lies Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) Session Establishment", Dave Cridland</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cridland-xmpp-session-01.txt</link>
    <description>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) historically had a Session Establishment request defined in RFC 3921 which clients were required to perform at the beginning of a session.  RFC 6121 dropped this entirely.  This specification reinstates it as an optional no-op to aid backwards compability, matching commonly deployed workarounds.</description>
