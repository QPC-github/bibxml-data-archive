    <description>For Mobile IPv6 service, the mobile node first connects to an Access Router and obtain an IPv6 address to use it as a Care-of-Address. In many networks, the Access Router sends Router Advertisement to the mobile node to convey various information. If the Access Router has the knowledge of the mobile nodes home info such as home agent address, the Access Router can convey that info to the mobile node along with the Router Advertisement. This document proposes a method that will allow the Access Router to include home info of the mobile node in the Router Advertisement message.</description>
