    <title>"Syslog Extension for Cloud Using Syslog Structured Data", Gene Golovinsky, Sam Johnston, Dominik Birk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cloud-log-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an open and extensible log format to be used by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and trace activities that occur in the cloud.  It is equally applicable for cloud infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services.  CloudLog is defferent in content, but not in nature from the traditional logging as it takes in account transient nature of identities and resources in the cloud.</description>
