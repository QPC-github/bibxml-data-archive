    <description>Currently, there are network management applications that present specific demands on a communication network.  This document describes the APONF basic architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main APONF architecture entities are the Network Management Application Agent (NMAA), which is a network entity that creates and runs network services, and Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), which supports classified application models.  Each of these models support application demands that are similar in nature and therefore can be grouped/classified together.  Moreover, the ABPD maps the classified application models into network capabilities, e.g., network management and controlling policies.</description>
