    <title>"Considerations regarding the correct use of EAP-Response/Identity", Stefan Winter</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-radext-populating-eapidentity-01.txt</link>
    <description>There are some subtle considerations for an EAP peer regarding the content of the EAP-Response/Identity packet when authenticating with EAP to an EAP server.  This document describes two such considerations and suggests workarounds to the associated problems. One of these workarounds is a new requirement for EAP peers that the use of UTF-8 is required for the content of EAP-Response/Identity (which updates RFC3748).</description>
