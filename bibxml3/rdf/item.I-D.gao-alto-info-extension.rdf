    <title>"ALTO Extensions for Multi-Source Information Collection", Kai Gao, Yang Yang</title>

    <description>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol enables the distribution of certain network information to applications. Hence, a fundamental functionality of an ALTO server is to collect general network information, especially from multiple "information sources".  In this document, we propose a preliminary solution to standardize the process of information collection for ALTO servers by extending the ALTO protocol with some new services, which can also serve as a unified approach of network information distribution.</description>
