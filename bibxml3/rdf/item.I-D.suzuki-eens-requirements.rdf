    <description>Requirements concerning an energy-efficient network system such as a cloud system are presented.  Specifically, a large-scale cloud system, which is composed of multiple data centers (DCs) and a wide area network (WAN) to connect these DCs, is focused on.  The problems needed to be overcome in order to make the system energy efficient are presented.  The requirements that must be satisfied in order to solve these problems are also presented.</description>
