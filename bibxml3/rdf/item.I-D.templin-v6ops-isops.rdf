    <title>"Operational Guidance for IPv6 Deployment in IPv4 Sites using ISATAP", Fred Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-templin-v6ops-isops-19.txt</link>
    <description>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures.  These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 provides satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications.  As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality.  This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).</description>
