    <description>The described in this memo protocol was developed for the application in distributed information measurement systems (IMS) at any stage of communication. It was designed for transmission of measured data from measuring devices to processing and storing equipment. Also it does support common device identification in distributed IMS. Due to its simplicity it can be easily implemented in firmware of any digital measuring device.</description>
