    <description>Dissemination of the Traffic flow information was first introduced in the BGP protocol [RFC5575].  FlowSpec routes are used to distribute traffic filtering rules that are used to filter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.  For the networks that only deploy an IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) (e.g., OSPF), it is required that the IGP is extended to distribute Flow Specification or FlowSpec routes.  This document discusses the use cases for distributing flow specification (FlowSpec) routes using OSPF.  Furthermore, this document defines a OSPF FlowSpec Opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA) encoding format that can be used to distribute FlowSpec routes, its validation procedures for imposing the filtering information on the routers, and a capability to indicate the support of FlowSpec functionality.</description>
