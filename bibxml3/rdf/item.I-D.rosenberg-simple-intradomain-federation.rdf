    <description>Presence federation involves the sharing of presence information across multiple presence systems.  Most often, presence federation is assumed to be between different organizations, such as between two enterprises or between and enterprise and a service provider. However, federation can occur within a single organization or domain. This can be the result of a multi-vendor network, or a consequence of a large organization that requires partitioning.  This document examines different use cases and models for intra-domain federation.</description>
