    <title>"BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP", Tony Bates</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idr-rfc2796bis-02.txt</link>
    <description>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. Typically all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external routing information must be re-distributed to all other routers within that AS. This represents a serious scaling problem that has been well documented with several alternatives proposed. This document describes the use and design of a method known as "Route Reflection" to alleviate the the need for "full mesh" IBGP.</description>
