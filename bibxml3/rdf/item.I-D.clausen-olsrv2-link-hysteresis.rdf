    <description>Established links between MANET nodes should be as reliable as possible in order to avoid data packet loss. This implies that MANET nodes' link sensing should be robust against bursty loss or transient connectivity between nodes. Therefore, in order to enhance the robustness of link sensing mechanisms, additional link hysteresis strategies are used. This draft describes such a hysteresis mechanism for OLSRv2.</description>
