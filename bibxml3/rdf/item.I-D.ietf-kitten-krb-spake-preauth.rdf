        <description>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This document has three goals.  First, increase the security of Kerberos pre-authentication exchanges by making offline brute-force attacks infeasible.  Second, enable the use of second factor authentication without the need for a separately-established secure channel.  This is achieved using the existing trust relationship established by the shared first factor.  Third, make Kerberos pre- authentication more resilient against time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp from the client.</description>
