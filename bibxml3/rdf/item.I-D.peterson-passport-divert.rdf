    <title>"PASSporT Extension for Diverted Calls", Jon Peterson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peterson-passport-divert-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends PASSporT, which conveys cryptographically- signed information about the people involved in personal communications, to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its originally destination to a new one.  This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios.</description>
