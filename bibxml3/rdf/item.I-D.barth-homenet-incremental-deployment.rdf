    <description>This document describes an incremental approach towards deploying HNCP and routing protocols in home networks.  Its aim is to provide a minimal, forward-compatible transitional extension to HNCP to promote testing, deployment and adoption of homenet technology while the IGP decision and standardization process is not yet finalized.</description>
