    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-maes-proposed-lemonade-profile-phase2-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document proposes an initial draft for LEMONADE profile phase 2. It is based on a combination of the content of LEMONADE profile [4] and the OMA MEM realization internet draft [21] initially considered for internet draft publication as information or standard track by LEMONADE. This also provides an initial proposal on how to divide the specification work between OMA MEM and LEMONADE for a LEMONADE realization of the OMA MEM enabler.</description>
