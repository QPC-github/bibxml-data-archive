    <description>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP.  Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths in Segment Routing (SR) TE networks.  This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two reverse unidirectional SR Paths into an Associated Bidirectional SR Path when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as well as when using a Stateless PCE.</description>
