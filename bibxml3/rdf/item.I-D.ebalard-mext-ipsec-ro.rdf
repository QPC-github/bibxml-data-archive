    <title>"Mobile IPv6 IPsec Route Optimization (IRO)", Arnaud Ebalard</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ebalard-mext-ipsec-ro-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo specifies an improved alternate route optimization procedure for Mobile IPv6 designed specifically for environments where IPsec is used between peers (most probably with IKE).  The replacement of the complex Return Routability procedure for a simple mechanism and the removal of HAO and RH2 extensions from exchanged packets result in performance and security improvements.</description>
