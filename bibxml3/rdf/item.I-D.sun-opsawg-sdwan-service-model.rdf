    <description>This document provides a YANG data model for an SD-WAN service.  An SD-WAN service is a connectivity service offered by a service provider network to provide connectivity across different locations of a customer network or between a customer network and an external network, such as the Internet or a private/public cloud network. This connectivity is provided as an overlay constructed using one of more underlay networks.  The model can be used by a service orchestrator of a service provider to request, configure, and manage the components of an SD-WAN service.</description>
