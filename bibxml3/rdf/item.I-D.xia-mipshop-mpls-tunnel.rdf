    <title>"MPLS Tunnel Support for Proxy Mobile IPv6", Frank Xia, Behcet Sarikaya</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-xia-mipshop-mpls-tunnel-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic between a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to be tunneled using IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP encapsulation headers.  In this document, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) tunneling is proposed as an alternative tunnel technology which is used between a MAG and a LMA.  MPLS is now become more and more popular, and MPLS support is an important function for edge and core routers.  Integrating MPLS and Proxy IP Mobility can leverage Proxy IP Mobility deployment in the industry.</description>
