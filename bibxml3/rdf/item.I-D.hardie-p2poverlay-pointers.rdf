    <title>"Mechanisms for use in pointing to overlay networks, nodes, or resources", Ted Hardie</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hardie-p2poverlay-pointers-00.txt</link>
    <description>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in them presents a number of bootstrapping problems.  While those hard problems are under discussion, this draft proposes a small set of mechanisms which are intended to be generically useful for providing pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks in web pages, email messages, and other textual media.  While the mechanisms described below each meet similar needs, they are not mutually exclusive; it is expected that each will find some useful deployment during the early days of peer-to-peer overlay deployment.</description>
