    <description>With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.  The EAP-AKA (and EAP-AKA') protocol is required for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks.  This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable the above- mentioned functions in such networks.  The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a Mobile Node) and its network counterpart (such as a AAA server) in the service provider's infrastructure.</description>
