    <description>Proxy Mobile IPv6, the IETF's protocol for network-based mobility management, requires a completed and successful authentication of the mobile node before it is registered at the mobility anchor.  This document describes inter-working between access authentication mechanisms, such as IEEE 802.1X, and the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol to enable trusted WiFi access to a network-based mobility management domain.  Furthermore, the use of authentication method specific identifiers for unique identification of mobile nodes during setup and maintenance of their mobility session is described, following recommendations of related standards organizations, such as 3GPP and the WiMAX Forum.</description>
