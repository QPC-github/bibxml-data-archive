    <description>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in "Generic Security Service API version 2 : Java Bindings" (RFC2853). This document obsoletes RFC 2853 by making specific and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of transcription errors and implementation experience. The GSS-API is described at a language independent conceptual level in "Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1" (RFC2743). The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS- API are "The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism" (RFC2025) and "The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism (RFC4121).</description>
