    <title>"Tracker vs. DHT Performance Comparison for P2P Streaming", Yan Hu, Yong Xia</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hu-ppsp-tracker-dht-performance-comparison-01.txt</link>
    <description>The draft makes performance analysis in two kinds of resource exchange and discovery methods, tracker based and DHT based architectures in P2P streaming. Our analysis shows that centralized tracker solution for resource discovery (and chunk lookup) has much shorter response time than highly distributed DHT approach.</description>
