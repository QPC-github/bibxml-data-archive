    <title>"Support for Short-Term, Automatically-Renewed (STAR) Certificates in Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)", Yaron Sheffer, Diego Lopez, Oscar de Dios, Antonio Pastor, Thomas Fossati</title>

    <description>Public-key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised, that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an unauthorized entity.  However the revocation process is often unreliable.  An alternative to revocation is issuing a sequence of certificates, each with a short validity period, and terminating this sequence upon compromise.  This memo proposes an ACME extension to enable the issuance of short-term and automatically renewed (STAR) X.509 certificates.
