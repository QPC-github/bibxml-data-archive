    <description>Anycast RP (Rendezvous Point) is widely supported by router vendors. Each RP in the anycast RP set is configured with the RP Address (RPA), and the addresses of all members/routers in the anycast-RP set. If the number of anycast RP members is more than 1, manual configuration of RP information is prone to inconsistency which can cause connectivity problems, especially when the addresses are IPv6 address or the members of anycast RP set need to be changed (e.g.some new members are added, or some old members are removed from the anycast RP set). Aiming to this problem, this document provides a mechanism to automatically configure anycast RP members/routers. In this mechanism,only one RP member/router in the anycast RP set needs to be configured firstly, so it knows the anycast RP address and the addresses of all members in the anycast RP set. It sends anycast RP configuration information (including the anycast RP address and an address list) to each of other member in the anycast-RP set. Other members will check the information and configure itself after receiving the anycast RP configuration information,and respond the firstly configured RP with checking results and configuration results.</description>
