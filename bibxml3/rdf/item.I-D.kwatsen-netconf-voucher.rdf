    <title>"Voucher and Voucher Revocation Profiles for Bootstrapping Protocols", Kent Watsen, Michael Richardson, Max Pritikin, Toerless Eckert</title>

    <description>This memo defines the two artifacts "voucher" and "voucher- revocation", which are YANG-defined structures that have been signed by a TBD algorithm.  The voucher artifact is generated by the device's manufacture or delegate.  The voucher's purpose is to securely assign one or more devices to an owner.  The voucher informs each device which entity it should consider to be its owner.  The voucher revocation artifact is used by the manufacturer or delegate (i.e.  the issuer of the voucher) to revoke vouchers, if ever necessary.  The voucher revocation format defined herein supports both issuer-wide and voucher-specific constructs, enabling usage flexibility.  For both artifacts, this memo only defines the artifact, leaving it to future work to describe specialized protocols for accessing them.</description>
