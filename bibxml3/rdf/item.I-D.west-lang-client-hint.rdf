    <title>"The 'Lang' Client Hint", Mike West</title>

    <description>This document defines a Client Hint that aims to allow developers to opt-in to the ability to perform content negotiation based on the set of natural languages preferred by the user agent.  This new mechanism is intended to improve upon the privacy properties of the "Accept- Language" header, and eventually to supplant it entirely.</description>
