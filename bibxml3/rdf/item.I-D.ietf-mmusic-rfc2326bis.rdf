    <description>This memorandum defines RTSP version 2.0 which obsoletes RTSP version 1.0 defined in RFC 2326.  The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-layer protocol for setup and control of the delivery of data with real-time properties.  RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and video.  Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips.  This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP and TCP, and provide a means for choosing delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 3550).</description>
