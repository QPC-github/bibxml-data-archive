        <title>"Using GOST Cryptographic Algorithms in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)", Valery Smyslov</title>

        <description>This document defines a set of cryptographic transforms for use in the Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  The transforms are based on Russian cryptographic standard algorithms (GOST).  Using GOST ciphers in IKEv2 was defined in RFC 9227, this document aims to define using GOST algorithms for the rest of cryptographic transforms used in IKEv2.  This specification was developed to facilitate implementations that wish to support the GOST algorithms.  This document does not imply IETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used in this document.</description>
