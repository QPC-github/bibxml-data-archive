    <title>"Connecting IPvX Networks over IPvY with a P2P Method", Jun Bi, You Wang, Xiaoxiang Leng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jbi-pxp-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a new method - PXP- to connect IPvX islands together over IPvY network and reduce the reliance on the relays of existing transition mechanisms by shifting the burden to edge gateways on each island.  In this method, direct tunnels are set up between the IPvX islands, and a P2P overlay network is maintained between their gateways to propagate information of tunnel end points.</description>
