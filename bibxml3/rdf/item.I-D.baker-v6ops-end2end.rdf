    <title>"The End to End Problem in a fully generalized IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4+IPv6  network", Fred Baker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-baker-v6ops-end2end-00.txt</link>
    <description>This note is intended to describe the end to end problem as it applies to a network of networks, wherein some component networks independently run only IPv4 with or without a transition mechanism, some run only IPv6 with or without a transition mechanism and without coordination of transition mechanisms, and some run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel supporting native routing.</description>
