    <description>This document describes a profile of the NETCONF protocol called NETCONF Light.  This profile modularizes the NETCONF protocol and allows devices to announce that they only support a subset of the NETCONF protocol operations.  This is useful in situations where devices are either too resource constrained to support all NETCONF operations or where devices are gradually updated from proprietary configuration interfaces to support NETCONF.</description>
