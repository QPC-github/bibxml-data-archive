    <description>This document discusses color-based tunnel selection for BGP payload prefixes.  It defines a set of extended mapping modes, and describes how to use them to construct tunnel selection schemes for flexible tunnel selection.  Tunnel selection schemes can be implemented as policies on routers performing tunnel selection, or signaled by next hop routers or a central controller by using the BGP extensions specified in this document.</description>
