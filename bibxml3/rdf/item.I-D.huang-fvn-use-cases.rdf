    <description>IP video traffic represents a large fraction of Internet traffic. Current infrastructures are not prepared to deal with the increasing amount of video traffic. How to transmit video traffic efficiently poses traffic management challenges to both network operators and Internet applications.  This document provides use cases where network operator and Internet application can be cooperative to improve video transmission efficiency, based on the fundamental traffic characteristics (e.g. frame priority, adaptive bit rate, etc.).</description>
