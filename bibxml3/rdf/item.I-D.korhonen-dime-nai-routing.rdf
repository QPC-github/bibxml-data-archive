    <description>This specification clarifies the Diameter realm based request routing.  We focus on the case where a Network Access Identifier in the User-Name AVP is used to populate the Destination-Realm AVP and the Network Access Identifier contains more than one realm.  This particular case is possible when the Network Access Identifier decoration is used to force a routing of request messages through a predefined list of realms.  However, this functionality is not unambiguously specified in the Diameter Base Protocol specification.</description>
