    <description>The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed fields whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not allow clients to advertise their capabilities to servers.  This document describes backward compatible mechanisms for allowing the protocol to grow.  This document is a starting point to update the EDNS0 RFC after 10 years of operational experience.</description>
