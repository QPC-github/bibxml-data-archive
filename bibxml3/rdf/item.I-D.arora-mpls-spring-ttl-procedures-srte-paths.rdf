    <description>Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using adjacency-sids, node-sids, and anycast-sids.  The SR-TE paths are built by stacking the labels that represent the nodes and links in the explicit path.  A very useful Operations And Maintenance requirement is to be able to trace these paths as defined in [RFC8029].  This document specifies a uniform mechanism to support MPLS traceroute for the SR-TE paths when the nodes in the network are following uniform mode or short-pipe mode [RFC3443].</description>
