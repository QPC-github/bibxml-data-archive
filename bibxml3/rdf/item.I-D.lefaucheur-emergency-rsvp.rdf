    <description>An Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS) requires the ability to provide an elevated probability of session establishment to an authorized user in times of network congestion (typically, during a crisis). When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, this may be facilitated through a network layer admission control solution, which supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., bandwidth). These resources may be explicitly set aside for emergency services, or they may be shared with other sessions. This document specifies RSVP extensions that can be used to support such an admission priority capability at the network layer. Note that these extensions represent one possible solution component in satisfying ETS requirements. Other solution components, or other solutions, are outside the scope of this document.</description>
