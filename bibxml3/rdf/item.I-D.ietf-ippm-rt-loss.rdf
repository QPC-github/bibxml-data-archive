    <description>Many user applications (and the transport protocols that make them possible) require two-way communications.  To assess this capability, and to achieve test system simplicity, round-trip loss measurements are frequently conducted in practice.  The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol specified in RFC 5357 establishes a round-trip loss measurement capability for the Internet.  However, there is currently no metric specified according to the RFC 2330 framework.  This memo adds round-trip loss to the set of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).</description>
