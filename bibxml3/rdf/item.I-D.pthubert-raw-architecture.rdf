        <description>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability and availability for IP connectivity over a wireless medium.  The wireless medium presents significant challenges to achieve deterministic properties such as low packet error rate, bounded consecutive losses, and bounded latency.  This document defines the RAW Architecture.  It builds on the DetNet Architecture and discusses specific challenges and technology considerations needed to deliver DetNet service utilizing scheduled wireless segments and other media, e.g., frequency/time-sharing physical media resources with stochastic traffic.</description>
