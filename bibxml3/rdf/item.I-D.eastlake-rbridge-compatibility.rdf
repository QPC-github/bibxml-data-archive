    <description>This document describes a layering and peering model for network switches and end stations. It also discusses, using this model, the compatibility of RBridges (Routing Bridges) with Layer 3 routers and various types of bridges including Shortest Path Bridges. RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) standard.</description>
