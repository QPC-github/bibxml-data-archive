    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-lake-reqs-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document compiles the requirements for a lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol for OSCORE.  This draft has completed a working group last call (WGLC) in the LAKE working group. Post-WGLC, the requirements are considered sufficiently stable for the working group to proceed with its work.  It is not currently planned to publish this draft as an RFC.</description>
