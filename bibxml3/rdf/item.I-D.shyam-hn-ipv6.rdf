    <description>This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of entire network in a large address space. It describes how entire address space can be distributed within some regions and sub regions inside each of them by establishing mesh structured hierarchy. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.</description>
