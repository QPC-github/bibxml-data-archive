    <description>This document defines terminology, problem statement and requirements for implementing IKE and IPsec on clusters.  It also describes gaps in existing standards and their implementation that need to be filled, in order to allow peers to interoperate with clusters from different vendors.  An agreed terminology, problem statement and requirements will allow IETF working gropus to consider development of IPsec/IKEv2 mechanisms to simplify cluster implementations.</description>
