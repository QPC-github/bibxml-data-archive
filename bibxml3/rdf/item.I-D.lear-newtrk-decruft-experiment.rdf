    <description>This memo documents an experiment to review and classify Proposed Standards as not reflecting documented practice within the world today. The results identify three classes of documents marked as Proposed Standards that should be considered for retirement in some way or another. We propose four options to move forward with further work in this area ranging from doing nothing to accepting the results entirely.</description>
