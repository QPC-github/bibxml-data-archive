    <title>"Publish-Subscribe Broker for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)", Michael Koster, Ari Keranen, Jaime Jimenez</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub-09.txt</link>
    <description>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor networks.  This document defines a publish- subscribe Broker for CoAP that extends the capabilities of CoAP for supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity and/or up-time.  There is work in progress to resolve some of the transfer layer issues by using a more RESTful approach.  Please see https://github.com/core-wg/pubsub/blob/master/proposal.txt</description>
