    <description>There are times when a user has a pair of protected resources that would like to request access to each other.  While OAuth flows typically enable the user to grant a client access to a protected resource, granting the inverse access requires an additional flow. Reciprocal OAuth enables a more seamless experience for the user to grant access to a pair of protected resources.</description>
