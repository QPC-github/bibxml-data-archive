    <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding architecture which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and doesn't require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state.  BIER is applicable in a multi-tenant data center network environment for efficient delivery of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic while eliminating the need for maintaining a huge amount of multicast state in the underlay.  This document describes BGP extensions for advertising the BIER-specific information.  These extensions are applicable in those multi-tenant data centers where BGP instead of IGP is deployed as an underlay for network reachability advertisement.  These extensions may also be applicable in other scenarios.</description>
