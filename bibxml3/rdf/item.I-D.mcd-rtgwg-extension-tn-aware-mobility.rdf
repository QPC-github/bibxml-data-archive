        <description>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY] draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths in IP and Layer 2 Transport networks.The focus of that work is limited to the mobility domain and transport network characteristics till the UPF and doesn't go beyond the UPF to the Data Network.  To maintain E2E transport network characteristics the framework needs to be extended beyond UPF. This document describes a framework for extending the mobility aware transport network characteristics from the UPF through the Data Network.</description>
