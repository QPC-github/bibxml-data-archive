    <description>Currently, network equipment already has some Northbound Interfaces, such as SNMP, NETCONF, TL1; and some languages are also provided to describe the data model, such as MIB, SCHEMA and even YANG.  While till now, there is not a clear defined information model.  In NETCONF domain, some standards are being defined.  In order to reduce the cost of NMS integration in customer side, a clear defined information model is necessary, just like the SID in TMF.</description>
