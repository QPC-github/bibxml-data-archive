    <description>This document describes a mechanism to extend Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding(uRPF). By associating an uRPF flag with a specific route, uRPF can be controlled in a finer granularity than traditional one. It may be used to reduce the cost to network devices caused by uRPF.</description>
