    <description>This document describes protocol specific procedures for GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) RSVP-TE (Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering) signaling extensions to support label switched path (LSP) segment protection and restoration. These extensions are intended to complement and be consistent with the Extensions for End-to-End GMPLS-based Recovery. Implications and interactions with Fast Reroute are also addressed. This document also updates the handling of Notify_Request objects.</description>
