    <description>Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building control systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect with each other, forming low-power and lossy networks (LLNs).  The CoAP/6LoWPAN standards are emerging as the de-facto protocols in this area for resource-constrained devices.  Both multicast and security are key needs in these networks.  This draft presents a method for securing multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS which is already present in CoAP devices.  This draft deals with the adaptation of the DTLS record layer to protect multicast group communication, assuming that all member devices already have a group key in their own possession.  The DTLS record layer implementation is used to encrypt a multicast message and to provide message authentication using the group key before sending the message via IP multicast to the group.</description>
