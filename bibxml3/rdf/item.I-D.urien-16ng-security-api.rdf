    <title>"Security API for the IEEE 802.16 Security Sublayer", Pascal Urien</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-urien-16ng-security-api-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a security Application Programming Interface (API), which aims at supporting tamper resistant devices that perform collaborative tasks with the IEEE 802.16 security sublayer.  The security sublayer provides operators with strong protection from theft of service. This security API enables to transfer critical calculations or protocol processing to trusted computers, such as smart cards or trusted platform modules (TPMs).</description>
