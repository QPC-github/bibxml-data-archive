    <title>"OMA Lightweight M2M for Management of Information Centric Networks", Anders Lindgren, Bengt Ahlgren</title>

    <description>The Internet-of-things (IoT) supports many applications and services where collection and distribution of data from and to devices is central, fitting the named data communication model of information- centric networking (ICN) quite well.  Many applications and use cases of the Internet of Things (IoT) imply information centric usage patterns.  The IoT differs from many typical information centric application because of the dynamic nature of IoT devices and the large number of such devices.  This creates a requirement for easy deployability in new locations without the need for complex setup or configuration of the devices.  This draft provides a study of how the OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) protocol for IoT device management can potentially be used for configuration and management of ICN parameters in an IoT network.  We will address some of the tradeoffs that need to be considered and give an initial example of how key LWM2M functionality can be mapped to the ICN/IoT scenario.</description>
