    <description>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities of Ethernet switches and Ethernet forwarding models. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized MPLS based control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity. GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed and this document provides a framework for these extensions.</description>
