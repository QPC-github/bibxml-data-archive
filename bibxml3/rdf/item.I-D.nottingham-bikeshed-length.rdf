    <title>"Advisory Content-Length for HTTP", Mark Nottingham</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nottingham-bikeshed-length-00.txt</link>
    <description>The HTTP Content-Length header field is overloaded with (at least) two duties: message delimitation in HTTP/1, and metadata about the length of an incoming request body to the software handling it.  This causes confusion, and sometimes problems.  This document proposes a new header to untangle these semantics (at least partially).</description>
