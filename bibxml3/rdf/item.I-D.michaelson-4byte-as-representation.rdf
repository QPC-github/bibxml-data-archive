    <title>"Canonical Textual Representation of Four-octet AS Numbers", Geoff Huston, George Michaelson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-michaelson-4byte-as-representation-05.txt</link>
    <description>A taxonomy of textual representations for four-octet Autonomous System (AS) numbers is defined.  The 'asdot' textual representation is recommended.  The syntax chosen avoids ambiguity with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community string representation of AS numbers. It is recommended that this textual representation be used by all documents, systems and user interfaces referring to four-octet AS numbers.</description>
