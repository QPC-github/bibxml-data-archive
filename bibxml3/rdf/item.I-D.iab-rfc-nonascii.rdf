    <title>"The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs", Heather Flanagan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-iab-rfc-nonascii-02.pdf</link>
    <description>In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the required language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically used in the English language.  This document describes the RFC Editor requirements and guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  This document updates RFC 7322.  Please review the PDF version of this draft.</description>
