    <description>This document provides detailed description of IPv6 deployment and integration methods and scenarios in today's Service Provider (SP) Broadband (BB) networks in coexistance with deployed IPv4 services. Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet, xDSL and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed in this document. In this document we will discuss main components of IPv6 BB networks and their differences from IPv4 BB networks and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in each of these BB technologies using tunneling mechanisms and native IPv6.</description>
