    <title>"Neighbor Discovery Shield (ND-Shield): Protecting against Neighbor Discovery Attacks", Fernando Gont</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-nd-shield-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a mechanism that can be implemented in layer-2 devices to mitigate attack vectors based on Neighbor Discovery messages.  It is meant to complement other mechanisms implemented in layer-2 devices such as Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) and DHCPv6-Shield, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive IPv6 First Hop Security solution.  This document is motivated by the desire to achieve feature parity with IPv4 with respect to First Hop Security mechanisms.</description>
