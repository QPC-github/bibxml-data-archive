    <title>"Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in E-MAIL,  version 1", Wayne Schlitt, Meng Weng Wong</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schlitt-spf-classic-02.txt</link>
    <description>E-mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular, existing protocols place no restriction on what a sending host can use as the reverse-path of a message or the domain given on the SMTP HELO/EHLO commands. This document describes version 1 of the SPF protocol, whereby a domain may explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name, and a receiving host may check such authorization.</description>
