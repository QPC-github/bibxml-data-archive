    <title>"Functional decomposition of the multihoming protocol", Marcelo Bagnulo, Jari  Arkko</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-shim6-functional-dec-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this note we will present a functional decomposition of the multihomig protocol i.e. the protocol for preserving established communications in multihomed environments. We will do so by describing a protocol walkthrough, presenting which functions have to be performed at each stage and the messages required to accomplish them. The functional decomposition presented in this draft is based on the general functional analysis of multihoming approaches presented in [3].</description>
