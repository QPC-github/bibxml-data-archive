    <title>"Domain-based Application Service Location Using URIs and the Dynamic  Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS)", Leslie Daigle</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-daigle-unaptr-02.txt</link>
    <description>The purpose of this document is to define a new, straightforward Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service (DDDS) application to allow mapping of domain names to URIs for particular application services and protocols. Although defined as a new DDDS application, dubbed U-NAPTR, this is effectively an extension of the Straightforward NAPTR (S-NAPTR) DDDS application.</description>
