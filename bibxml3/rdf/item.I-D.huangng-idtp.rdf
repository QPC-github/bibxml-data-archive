    <description>The Identifier Tracing Protocol (IDTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed and collaborative information systems. It is a generic communication protocol which can be used for many tasks with two types of forwarding mechanisms to achieve traceability by using Universal Traceable Identifier (UTID) [I-D-UTID] which contains two types of forwarding messages.  This document provides the specification of IDTP, including syntax, data format, and the guidelines for their use, too.</description>
