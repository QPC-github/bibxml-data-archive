        <description>EVPN and PBB-EVPN introduce a family of solutions for multipoint Ethernet services over MPLS/IP network with many advanced features among which their multi-homing capabilities.  These solutions introduce Single-Active and All-Active for an Ethernet Segment (ES), itself defined as a set of physical links between the multi-homed device/network and a set of PE devices that they are connected to. This document extends the Ethernet Segment concept so that an ES can be associated to a set of EVCs (e.g., VLANs) or other objects such as MPLS Label Switch Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs), referred to as Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES).  This draft describes the requirements and the extensions needed to support vES in EVPN and PBB-EVPN.</description>
