        <description>Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) is a reliability mechanism that is distinct and separate from the retransmission logic in reliable transfer protocols such as TCP.  FEC coding can help deal with losses at the end of transfers or with networks having non-congestion losses.  However, FEC coding mechanisms should not hide congestion signals.  This memo offers a discussion of how FEC coding and congestion control can coexist.  Another objective is to encourage the research community to also consider congestion control aspects when proposing and comparing FEC coding solutions in communication systems.  This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  The scope of the document is end-to-end communications: FEC coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document.</description>
