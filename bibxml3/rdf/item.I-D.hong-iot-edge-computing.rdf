    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hong-iot-edge-computing-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes new challenges such as strict latency, constrained network bandwidth and devices, intermittent connectivity, privacy and security, for IoT services originated from the IoT environmental changes.  In order to address those new challenges, the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been emerged as a promising solution.  This document discribes the concept of IoT integrated with Edge computing as well as its use cases.  It also discusses benefits and challenges of Edge computing.  The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed in the IETF/IRTF.</description>
