    <description>The MPEG Media Transport Protocol (MMTP) is a transport protocol that is designed to support download, progressive download, and streaming applications simultaneously.  MMTP provides a generic media streaming mode by optimizing the delivery of generic media data encapsulated according to the ISO-Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF).  In the file delivery mode, MMTP supports the delivery of any type of file.  MMTP may used in IP unicast or multicast delivery and supports both Forward Error Correction (FEC) and retransmissions for reliable delivery of content.</description>
