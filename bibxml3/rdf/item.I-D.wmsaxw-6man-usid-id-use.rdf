    <description>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.  It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments.  A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address.  Segment Routing can be applied in the MPLS data plane by encoding segments in an MPLS label stack.  It also can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of segment identifiers in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH).  In this document is described the use of unified segment identifiers in use cases where interworking between SR-MPLS and SRv6 is required.</description>
