    <title>"System for Managing a Shared Domain Registry", Matthew Hunt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nzrs-srs-02.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes the typical usage and communication protocol of a client/server shared registry system for management of domain name registrations.  The system described is a "thick registry" system, providing support for the storage and management of both the technical and the registrant contact information concerning domain registrations.  The system relies on the existing HTTP and HTTPS infrastructure for transport and secure transfer to avoid having to implement a dedicated protocol and server environment.  A bespoke XML format is used to communicate between clients and the SRS server.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author: matt@nzrs.net.nz</description>
