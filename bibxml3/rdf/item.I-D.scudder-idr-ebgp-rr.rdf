    <title>"Considerations for Route Reflection and EBGP", John Scudder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-scudder-idr-ebgp-rr-02.txt</link>
    <description>Although originally conceived of as a purely IBGP device, in some cases a route reflector may function as an EBGP speaker in addition to its role as envisioned in RFC 4456.  When it does so, just like any other EBGP speaker it must advertise its routes to its IBGP peers.  This document updates RFC 4456 by explaining what behavior is required of a route reflector that also functions as an EBGP speaker. It also clarifies the use of the ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST attributes in this environment.</description>
