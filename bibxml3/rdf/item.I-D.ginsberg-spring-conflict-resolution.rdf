    <description>In support of Segment Routing (SR) routing protocols advertise a variety of identifiers used to define the segments which direct forwarding of packets.  In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol instance is either internally inconsistent or conflicts with advertisements from another protocol instance a means of achieving consistent forwarding behavior in the network is required.  This document defines the policies used to resolve these occurrences.</description>
