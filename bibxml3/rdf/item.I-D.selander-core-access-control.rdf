    <title>"Access Control Framework for Constrained Environments", Goran Selander, Mohit Sethi, Ludwig Seitz</title>

    <description>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight web transfer protocol designed to be used in constrained environments. Transport layer security for CoAP has been addressed with a DTLS binding for CoAP. This document describes a generic and dynamic access control framework suitable for constrained devices e.g. using CoAP and DTLS.  The framework builds on well known paradigms for access control, externalizing authorization decision making to unconstrained nodes while performing authorization decision enforcement and verification of local conditions in constrained devices.</description>
