    <title>"Carrier Survey Results on GMPLS-based Shared-Mesh Transport Restoration  Strategies", Richard Rabbat</title>

    <description>Optical transport networks operated using a GMPLS-based control plane enable today's network operators to offer valuable new services. With the completion of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards and the availability of products implementing them, providers are now looking at ways to enable additional features, such as shared-mesh restoration. These can be key to efficient network operation while providing strict performance guarantees. In that context, several areas of work still need to be addressed within the CCAMP WG of the IETF to develop interoperable, standards-based solutions that carriers can embrace. Towards that end, this document presents the results of a serious attempt to systematically gather and collate carrier inputs on strategies for shared-mesh restoration and the associated issues. The survey results are presented in aggregate form to provide an overview of carrier thinking, while retaining specific carrier response confidentiality. The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, and identify specific work items to focus on and facilitate further discussion on them. This is to enable the CCAMP WG to pursue ongoing and further work in this area that is focused towards addressing the identified carrier requirements.</description>
