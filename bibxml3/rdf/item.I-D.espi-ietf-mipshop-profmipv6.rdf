    <description>The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol was developed from the experience of MIPv6 and the facilities provided by link layer triggers, allowing for a proactive approach to handover that minimises packet exchange delay and packet loss.  On completion of handover, the mobile node engages MIPv6 procedures in to update the Home Agent with the mobile node's new location.  Subsequently, the mobile node may carry out Return Routability with the correspondent node(s) for route optimization.  However, this method leaves scope to optimize handover delays derived from the signalling message exchange.  This document proposes an enhancement to FMIPv6, the Proactive Route Optimization for FMIPv6 (PRO-FMIPv6) protocol, which aims to further reduce the signalling load thereby improving the overall performance of the handover process.</description>
