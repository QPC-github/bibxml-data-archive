    <title>"A Transparent Performance Enhancing Proxy Architecture To Enable TCP over Multiple Paths for Single-Homed Hosts", Tacettin Ayar, Berthold Rathke, Lukasz Budzisz, Adam Wolisz</title>

    <description>This draft complements the work of MPTCP by defining a TCP Splitter/ Combiner Architecture (SCA) that enables non-MPTCP-capable single- homed hosts to benefit from the multiple paths within Internet by means of performance enhancing proxies (PEPs) placed in the access networks.  SCA Proxies (SCAPs) make use of multiple paths in a way which is completely transparent to end-hosts.  Since the existence of the SCAPs is shielded from the TCP end-points, they can be deployed in the Internet as well as on the end-systems.</description>
