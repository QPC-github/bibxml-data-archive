    <title>"Encoding of Secure Common Alert Protocol Entities (ESCAPE)", Richard Barnes, Andrew Chi</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-atoca-escape-02.txt</link>
    <description>Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that an alert they receive was issued by an authorized source.  The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert information.  This document describes a security wrapper for Common Alerting Protocol objects to allow alerts to be signed by alert originators.  Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
