    <title>"Neighbor discovery to support direct communication in ITS", Zhiwei Yan, Jong-Hyouk Lee</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yan-its-nd-01.txt</link>
    <description>For C-ACC, Platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, how to establish direct IP communication paths between neighbor vehicles poses two issues : how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the nearby service (from the upper layer); how to discover the link-layer address of the selected vehicle (from the lower layer).  This draft aims to solve these problems based on mDNS.</description>
