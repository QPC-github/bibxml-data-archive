    <description>This document describes an architecture for a global, scalable, resilient and administratively distributed system for mapping geographic location information to URLs. The architecture generalizes well-known approaches found in hierarchical lookup systems such as DNS. The architecture does not depend on using a specific protocol, but does require that protocols can summarize the coverage region of a node.</description>
