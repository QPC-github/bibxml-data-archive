    <title>"Non-Custodial (Best-Effort) Multicasting Support in DTN", Susan Symington</title>

    <description>This document defines the requirements and constraints that must be imposed when using the Bundle Protocol [2] in order to support the best-effort multicast delivery of bundles within a Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN). The capabilities described herein enable a source node to transmit a bundle to multiple destination nodes without having to originate a separate bundle for each destination node. These capabilities do not support custody transfer of bundles that are being delivered via multicast.</description>
