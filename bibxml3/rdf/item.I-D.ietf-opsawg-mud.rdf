    <description>This memo specifies a component-based architecture for manufacturer usage descriptions (MUD).  The goal of MUD is to provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and network functionality they require to properly function.  The initial focus is on access control.  Later work can delve into other aspects.  This memo specifies two YANG modules, IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options, an LLDP TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension and a means to sign and verify the descriptions.</description>
