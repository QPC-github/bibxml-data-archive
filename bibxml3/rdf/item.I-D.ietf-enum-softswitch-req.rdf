    <description>This document describes experiences of operational requirements and several considerations for ENUM-based softswitches concerning call routing between two Korean VoIP carriers, gained during the ENUM pre- commercial trial hosted by National Internet Development Agency of Korea (NIDA) in 2006.  These experiences show that an interim solution can maintain the stability of on-going commercial softswitch system operations during the initial stage of ENUM service, where the DNS does not have sufficient data for the majority of calls.</description>
