    <description>Efficient and service aware flexible end-to-end routing in future communication networks is achieved by routing protocol approaches making use of Identifier Locator separation systems.  Since these systems require a correlation between identifiers and location which might allow tracking and misusage of individuals' identities and locations such operation demands for highly secure measures to preserve privacy of users and devices.  This document tries to identify and describe typical use cases and derive thereof a problem statement describing issues and challenges for application of privacy preserving Identifier-Locator split (PidLoc) approaches.</description>
