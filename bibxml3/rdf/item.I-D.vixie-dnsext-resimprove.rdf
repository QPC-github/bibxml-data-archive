    <title>"Improvements to DNS Resolvers for Resiliency, Robustness, and Responsiveness", Paul Vixie, Rodney Joffe, Frederico Neves</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vixie-dnsext-resimprove-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes several mechanisms which can be employed by iterative caching DNS resolvers to improve resiliency, robustness, and responsiveness.  These improvements are optional and they require no changes to the protocol, or to authority servers, or to DNS stub resolver clients.</description>
