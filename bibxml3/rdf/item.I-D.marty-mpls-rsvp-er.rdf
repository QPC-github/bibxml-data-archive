    <title>"RSVP Extensions for Explicit Rate Congestion Control in Multiprotocol Label  Switched (MPLS) Networks", Christopher Marty, Muhammad Ali</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-marty-mpls-rsvp-er-00.txt</link>
    <description>This memo presents a set of extensions for supporting explicit rate congestion control using RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension to the RSVP functional specifications [RFC2205] These extensions include the standard format of the ER_SPEC object, and a description of RSVP's handling of the ER_SPEC object. This document does not advocate a particular distributed explicit rate congestion control algorithm.</description>
