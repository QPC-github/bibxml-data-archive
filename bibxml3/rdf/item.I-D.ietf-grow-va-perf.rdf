    <description>The document "FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation" [I-D.francis-intra-va] describes how router FIB size may be reduced. This approach entails a trade-off between path-length and load versus FIB size.  It also has the potential to reduce convergence time. This document describes the results of several studies that examine these characteristics.  The results of a study for a Tier-1 ISP with a relatively sophisticated deployment of VA, shows that FIB size could be reduced ten times or more with a worst-case latency penalty of 4ms and a worst-case load increase of &lt;1.5%.  Another study, examining a much simpler style of VA deployment, also for a Tier-1 ISP, shows that FIB size can be reduced by four times (in routers serving as APRs), and more than 10 times in other routers.  Here, worst-case latency increase was 16 ms, though this is almost certainly an over-estimate, both because traceroute was used to make the measurement, and because popular prefixes were not considered.</description>
