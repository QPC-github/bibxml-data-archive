    <description>This draft brings blockchain into the detnet use case list. Generally speaking, blockchain is both a technical term and a blockchain-based industry, which is spreading into a wide range of industries other than the thriving bitcoin.  Blockchain would have to require the supporting network offer deterministic networking service rather than the ongoing best-effort, because of its inherent p2p and frequent multicast working mechanism.  Blockchain working process, its current network mechanism and challenges ahead, as well as requirements to detnet will be illustrated in the draft.</description>
