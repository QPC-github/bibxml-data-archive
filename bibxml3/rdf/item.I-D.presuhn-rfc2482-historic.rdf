    <description>RFC 2482, Language Tagging in Unicode Plain Text, described a mechanism for using special Unicode language tag characters to identify languages when needed without more general markup such as that provided by XML.  The Unicode Consortium has deprecated that facility and strongly recommends against its use.  RFC 2482 should be moved to Historic to reduce the possibility that Internet implementers would consider that system an appropriate mechanism for identifying languages.</description>
