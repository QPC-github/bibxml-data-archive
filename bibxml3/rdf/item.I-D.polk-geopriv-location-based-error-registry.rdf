    <title>"A Geopriv Registry for Location-based Error Response Codes", James Polk</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-polk-geopriv-location-based-error-registry-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document IANA registers a list of GEOPRIV location-specific error response indications, to be used by signaling protocols describing a location-based error experienced by an intermediary or recipient endsystem. For example, the registered values here can be placed in a SIP Reason header contained within a 424 (Bad Location Information) response, or in a Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) query failure, giving specific meaning to the reason for the error. This additional information is to provide the location transmitter more granular information about what was wrong with the supplied location in the original request message.</description>
