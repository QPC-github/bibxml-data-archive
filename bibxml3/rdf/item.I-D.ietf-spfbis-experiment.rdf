    <title>"Resolution of The SPF and Sender ID Experiments", Murray Kucherawy</title>

    <description>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising SPF and Sender ID, two proposed email authentication protocols.  Both of these protocols enable one to publish via the Domain Name System a policy declaring which mail servers were authorized to send email on behalf of the domain name being queried.  There was concern that the two would conflict in some significant operational situations, interfering with message delivery.  The IESG required the publication of all of these documents (RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407, and RFC4408) with Experimental status, and requested that the community observe deployment and operation of the protocols over a period of two years from the date of publication to determine a reasonable path forward.  After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiments thus created can be considered concluded.  This document presents those findings.</description>
