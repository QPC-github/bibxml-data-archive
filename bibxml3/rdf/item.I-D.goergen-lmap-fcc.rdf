    <description>Analyzing and aggregating large-scale broadband measurements is essential to study trends and derive network analytics.  These trends and analyses could be made available through well defined protocols such as the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol. However, ALTO requires network information to be distilled and abstracted in form of a network map and a cost map.  We describe our methodology for analyzing the United States Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Measuring Broadband America (MBA) dataset to derive required topology and cost maps suitable for consumption by an ALTO server.</description>
