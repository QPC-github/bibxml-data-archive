    <description>There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN community regarding mobile usage scenarios.  Mobility considerations is required for the deployment of SmartGrids.  The mobility analysis for SmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is required to ensure proper performance for the mobile usage cases.  Also, mobility in 6LoWPAN sensor networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPAN architecture.  Hence it is best to have mobility as a consideration upfront rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN milestones.  This document provides a mobility perspective to the 6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.</description>
