    <title>"PASSporT Extension for Caller Name", Jon Peterson, Chris Wendt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-peterson-stir-cnam-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed information about the people involved in personal communications, to include a human-readable display name comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network.  The element defined for this purpose is extensible to include related information about callers that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone.</description>
