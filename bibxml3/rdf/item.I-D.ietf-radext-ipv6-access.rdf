    <description>This document specifies additional IPv6 RADIUS attributes useful in residential broadband network deployments.  The attributes, which are used for authorization and accounting, enable assignment of a host IPv6 address and IPv6 DNS server address via DHCPv6; assignment of an IPv6 route announced via router advertisement; assignment of a named IPv6 delegated prefix pool; and assignment of a named IPv6 pool for host DHCPv6 addressing.</description>
