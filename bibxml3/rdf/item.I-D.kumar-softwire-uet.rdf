    <title>"UDP Entropy Tunnel for Softwire", Carlos Pignataro, Nagendra Kumar, Pradosh Mohapatra, Clarence Filsfils</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kumar-softwire-uet-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a method for encapsulatation of tunneled packets within UDP in order to provide per-flow entropy for load- balancing.  The method is targeted for use with softwire mesh deployments that include routers which have support for load- balancing based on UDP ports and not fields in L2TPv3 or GRE.</description>
