    <description>Network operators offer multiple services ranging from basic network access level service to application level service. Each of these services require independent authentication and authorization steps. Depending on the number of services and the scale of these networks, the need for multiple levels of authentication and authorization phases not only makes the operation complex, but it increases network load and session setup latency. This document summarizes the related problem scenarios. The goal is to address these problem scenarios with a solution based on the EAP keying framework.</description>
