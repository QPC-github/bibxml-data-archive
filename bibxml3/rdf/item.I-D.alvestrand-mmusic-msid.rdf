    <description>This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams that can be used to specify relations between media streams within different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session.  This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "media stream" / "media stream track" using SDP signaling.  This document is an input document for discussion.  It should be discussed in the MMUSIC WG list, mmusic@ietf.org.</description>
