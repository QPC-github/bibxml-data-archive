    <description>Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings (NOMADv6) introduces a set of extensions for MIPv6 protocol that allows for intelligent use of multiple points of attachment simultaneously, on a mobile node. It specifies a set of rules (filters) communicated to binding agents using binding updates. In turn, binding agents use this information to determine whether and where to route flows associated with the mobile node. In this manner, it is possible for a mobile node to distribute flows or packets of a flow among its available points of attachment or to request that such flow is dropped before traversing the Internet fabric, with or without notification to their source. These extensions mirror a similar extension defined for Mobile IPv4 (NOMADv4) but has been extended to cater to the behavior of IPv6.</description>
