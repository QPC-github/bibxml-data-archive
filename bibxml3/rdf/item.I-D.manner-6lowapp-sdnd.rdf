    <title>"Coupling of Service and Neighbor Discovery in 6LowPAN", Jukka Manner</title>

    <description>Finding out functionality, nodes or services, in general resources, in a network has a number of well-known solutions.  A sensor network has inherent limitations and requires a solution that has a low footprint and follows the networking concepts defined within 6LoWPAN. This draft discusses two alternative solutions to service discovery in a sensor network.  Both approaches are based on the 6LowPAN Neighbor Discovery.</description>
