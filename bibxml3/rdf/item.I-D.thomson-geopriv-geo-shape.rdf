    <title>"Geodetic Shapes for the Representation of Uncertainty in PIDF-LO", Martin  Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-geopriv-geo-shape-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a set of shapes for the representation of uncertainty for PIDF-LO geodetic location information. This includes a GML profile and a schema that defines additional geometries. Further recommendations are made to restrict the use of geographic Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and units of measure restrictions that improve interoperability.</description>
