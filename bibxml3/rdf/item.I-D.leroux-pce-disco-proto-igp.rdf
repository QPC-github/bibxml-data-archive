    <title>"IGP protocol extensions for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery", Jean-Louis Le Roux</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-leroux-pce-disco-proto-igp-00.txt</link>
    <description>In various situations it would be highly useful for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Path Computation Element(s) (PCE), along with some of information relevant for PCE selection. When the PCE is an LSR participating to the IGP, or even a server participating passively to the IGP, a simple and efficient way for PCE discovery, consists of relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose this document defines simple OSPF and ISIS extensions for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within and across IGP areas.</description>
