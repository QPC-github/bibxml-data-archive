    <description>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection protocol that can quickly determine a communication failure between devices and notify upper-layer applications [RFC5880].  BFD has asynchronous detecting mode and demand detection mode to satisfy different scenarios, also supports echo function to reduce the device requirement for BFD.  One-Arm BFD this draft descripted supports another BFD detecting function rather than the echo as described in [RFC5880] [RFC5881], it needs nothing BFD capability to one of the devices deployed BFD detecting.  Using One-Arm BFD function, the one device works on BFD detecting normally and the other device just loopback the BFD packets like echo function.  One-Arm BFD is suitable for the cloud virtualization network, the One-Arm BFD is deploy on NFV gateways, and NFV virtual machine vNICs just enable the echo/ loopback process.</description>
