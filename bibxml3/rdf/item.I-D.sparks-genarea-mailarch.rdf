    <description>The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work. Participants frequently need to search and browse the archives of these lists, and have asked for improved search capabilities.  The current archive mechanism could also be made more efficient.  This memo captures the requirements for improved email list archiving and searching systems.</description>
