    <description>Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) intend to facilitate use cases related to medical field.  IEEE 802.15.6 defines PHY and MAC layer and is designed to deal with better penetration through the human tissue without creating any damage to human tissues with the approved MICS (Medical Implant Communication Service) band by USA Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Devices of WBANs conform to this IEEE standard.  This specification defines details to enable transmission of IPv6 packets, method of forming link-local and statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on WBANs.</description>
