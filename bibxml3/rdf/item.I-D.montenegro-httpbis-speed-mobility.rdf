    <description>This document describes "HTTP Speed+Mobility," a proposal for HTTP 2.0 that emphasizes performance improvements and security while at the same time accounting for the important needs of mobile devices and applications.  The proposal starts from both the Google SPDY protocol and the work the IETF has done around WebSockets.  The proposal is not a final product but rather is intended to form a baseline for working group discussion.</description>
