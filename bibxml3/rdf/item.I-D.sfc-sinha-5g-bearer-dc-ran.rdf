    <description>This document attempts the case for new work that needs to be developed for 5G users to improve faster download and upload of the user's data in a scenario of dual-connectivity 3GPP access outlining the poor radio coverage issues. This document also outlines the faster user data mechanism accompanying 3GPP access of 5G user device via bearer offloading in case of a poor coverage.</description>
