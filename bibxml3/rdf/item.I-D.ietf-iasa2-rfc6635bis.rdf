    <title>"RFC Editor Model (Version 2)", Olaf Kolkman, Joel Halpern, Robert Hinden</title>

    <description>The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company and the RSOC.  This document reflects the experience gained with "RFC Editor Model (Version 1)", documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references to the IASA and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.  [RFC Editor: Please remove the following paragraph prior to publication.]  The IASA2 WG requests that the IAB publish this replacement for RFC 6635.</description>
