    <description>The document describes three distinct SDWAN scenarios and discusses the applicability of BGP for each of those scenarios. The goal of the document is to demonstrate how BGP-based control plane is used for large scale SDWAN overlay networks with little manual intervention.  SDWAN edge nodes are commonly interconnected by multiple underlay networks which can be owned and managed by different network providers.</description>
