    <title>"Secure Messaging in XMPP", Martin Thomson, Adam Roach</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-xmpp-secure-00.txt</link>
    <description>The history of secure messaging in XMPP is spotty.  The long-running de facto scheme, OTR, enjoys fairly wide implementation and use, but OTR suffers from some serious usability and security shortcomings that make it unsuitable as a basis for encryption.  This document describes an architecture that provides end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for XMPP messaging.  Solutions for both multi-user and one-to-one messaging are provided.</description>
