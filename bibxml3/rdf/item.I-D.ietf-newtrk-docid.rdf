    <title>"Identifying Standards Track Documents", John Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-newtrk-docid-00.txt</link>
    <description>In the present Internet Standards Process, stable identifiers for standards, as distinct from documents (for which RFC numbers are sufficient), has become problematic because proportionately few documents reach Full Standard and are assigned STD numbers. Several proposals have been introduced into NEWTRK to address this problem, but only in the context of trying to resolve a number of other issues. In the hope of making some progress on this dimension, this document proposes a change to the standards-track document identifier system only.</description>
