        <description>IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network based on the IGP metric assigned to the links.  Many network deployments use RSVP-TE based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to steer traffic over a path that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP path.  This document proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute constraint-based paths over the network.  This document also specifies a way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along the constraint-based paths.</description>
