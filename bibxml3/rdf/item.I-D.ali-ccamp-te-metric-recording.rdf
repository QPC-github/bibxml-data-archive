    <description>There are many scenarios in which Traffic Engineering (TE) metrics such as cost, latency and latency variation associated with a Forwarding Adjacency (FA) or Routing Adjacency (RA) Label Switched Path (LSP) are not available to the ingress and egress nodes. This draft provides extensions for the Resource ReserVation Protocol- Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the support of the discovery of cost, latency and latency variation of an LSP.</description>
