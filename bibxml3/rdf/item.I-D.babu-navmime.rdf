    <title>"HTTP Performance extension for NAV systems", Babu Neelam</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-babu-navmime-00.txt</link>
    <description>Typically an NAV (network-based anti-virus) system stores the entire HTTP response from the server, scan the response for malware and then transmits it to the client. This extension attempts to better response time for Web traffic by letting the NAV (network-based anti-virus) system save the time required for the NAV system for transmission of data from the NAV system to the client. In addition, this extension also helps in reporting download progress and avoiding client connection timeout.</description>
