    <title>"Extension of OSPF-MDR to Allow Option of Using MPRs", Richard Ogier</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ogier-manet-ospf-mdr-ext-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an extension of OSPF-MDR which allows the option of using multipoint relays (MPRs) to select the MANET Designated Routers (MDRs), which form a CDS used for flooding LSAs. This extension allows each router to decide independently whether or not to select MPRs, so it provides additional flexibility without having to specify OSPF-MDR so that it either requires or prohibits MPRs. The use of MPRs in OSPF-MDR may provide some advantages (e.g., a CDS with a smaller stretch factor), although this may come with some costs in terms of overhead and/or response time. Simulations are planned to compare the performance of OSPF-MDR with and without MPRs.</description>
