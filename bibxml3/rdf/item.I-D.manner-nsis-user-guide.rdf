    <description>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Working group was officially formed in November 2001 to standardize a new IP signaling protocol suite.  Six years have now passed and the first actual protocol specifications have been finalized.  The purpose of this draft is to give an overview of what has been achieved, how the industry can make use of the new protocols, and how the research community can further extend the designs.</description>
