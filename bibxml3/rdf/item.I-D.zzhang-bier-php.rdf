    <description>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider tunnel for MVPN/GTM [RFC6514] [RFC7716] or EVPN BUM [RFC7432].  It is possible that not all routers in the provider network support BIER and there are various methods to handle BIER incapable transit routers.  However the MVPN/EVPN PEs are assumed to be BIER capable - they are BFIRs/BFERs.  This document specifies a method to allow BIER incapable routers to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER as the transport, by having the upstream BFR (connected directly or indirectly via a tunnel) of a PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the PE.</description>
