    <title>"SMTP Service Extension for Detached Operation", Eric Burger</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-burger-smtp-deta-00.txt</link>
    <description>The normal operation for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is for the submitting device to wait for all processing to complete and for the server to return a positive acknowledgement to the client. However, some devices have very intermittent connectivity, such as wireless mobile terminals. For such devices, a means to have processing continue in the case of a dropped connection is desirable. To this end, this SMTP service extension enables a client to submit a message and reliably detach from the session, indicating to the server to continue in the absence of a connection to the client.</description>
