    <title>"Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", Pasi  Eronen, Hannes Tschofenig</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-psk-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on pre-shared keys. These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys, shared in advance among the communicating parties. The first set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations for authentication. The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key; and the third set combines public key authentication of the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client.</description>
