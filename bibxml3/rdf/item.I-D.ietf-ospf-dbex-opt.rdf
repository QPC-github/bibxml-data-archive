    <title>"OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization", Richard Ogier</title>

    <description>This document describes a backward compatible optimization for the Database Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  In this optimization, a router does not list an LSA in Database Description packets sent to a neighbor, if the same or a more recent instance of the LSA was listed in a Database Description packet already received from the neighbor.  This optimization reduces Database Description overhead by about 50% in large networks.  This optimization does not affect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information from Database Description packets.</description>
