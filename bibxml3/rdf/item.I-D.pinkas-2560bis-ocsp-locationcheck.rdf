    <description>RFC 2560 [RFC2560] allows CAs to designate one or more OCSP Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status of the certificates they issue under a given CA key.  This document introduces a new feature that allows allows CAs to split the workload between different sets of OCSP Responders in a way that is analogous to the way CRLs can be split between different sets of CRL issuers (using the cRLDistributionPoints extension).  This new feature allows a CA to designate one or more OCSP Responders for being responsible to provide the revocation status for a subset of the certificates they issue under a given CA key.  This document defines a critical extension that may only be placed in an OCSP certificate and the way it shall be processed by OCSP clients.</description>
