    <title>"The Use of Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) in IPsec ESP and AH", David McGrew, John Viega</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mcgrew-aes-gmac-esp-02.txt</link>
    <description>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC) as a mechanism to provide data origin authentication, but not confidentiality, within the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH). GMAC is based on the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation, and can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations.</description>
