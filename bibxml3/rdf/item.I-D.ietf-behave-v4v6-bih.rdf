    <title>"Dual Stack Hosts Using "Bump-in-the-Host" (BIH)", Bill Huang, Hui Deng, Teemu Savolainen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-behave-v4v6-bih-09.txt</link>
    <description>Bump-In-the-Host (BIH) is a host-based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol translation mechanism that allows a class of IPv4-only applications that work through NATs to communicate with IPv6-only peers.  The host on which applications are running may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access networks.  BIH hides IPv6 and makes the IPv4-only applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local synthesis of IPv4 addresses.  This document obsoletes RFC 2767 and RFC 3338.</description>
