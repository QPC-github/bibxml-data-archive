    <title>"Establishing Handover Keys using Shared Keys", Vidya Narayanan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-vidya-mipshop-handover-keys-aaa-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a key management protocol to generate a handover key between a mobile node (MN) and an access router (AR) for the purpose of securing Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) signaling messages. As such, it specifies a message exchange between the MN and the AR and assumptions that must hold in order for this protocol to work. The protocol itself is described here for FMIPv6 use, but is applicable to other protocols that need to establish shared keys between the MN and a network entity.</description>
