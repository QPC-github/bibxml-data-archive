    <description>We propose to standardize the key signaling protocols among various P2P streaming system components including the tracker and the peers. These protocols, called PPSP, are a part of P2P streaming protocols. This document describes the terminologies, concepts, incentives, and scope of developing PPSP, as well as the use cases of PPSP.</description>
