    <description>In some cases a UA (or proxy) within a Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] Service Provider (SSP) has multiple parallel egress proxy options to reach an ingress proxy within another SSP to reach the target UA.  If the originating SSP uses ENUM to identify the ingress proxy of the target SSP, there is currently no way for the ENUM NAPTR response to identify a specific preferred egress proxy from the set of multiple parallel proxies.  This draft solves this problem by defining a method for returning deterministic routing information within an ENUM NAPTR response enabling the UA (or proxy) to choose a preferred egress proxy.  Using this information, the originating UA now sends the SIP request through the predetermined preferred egress proxy to reach the target SSP's proxy.  This document describes several methods to make this determination by incorporating variables into a SIP service URI contained in the E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) response.</description>
