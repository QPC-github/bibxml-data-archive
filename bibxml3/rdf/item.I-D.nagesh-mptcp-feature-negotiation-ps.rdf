    <title>"Problem Statement of MPTCP Transmission Feature Negotiation", Nagesh Shamnur, Zhen Cao</title>

    <description>Path manager and packet scheduler are two important components of MPTCP protocol and associated implementations.  Normally they are implemented and configured statically.  This draft discusses the scenarios where statically configured path manager and packet scheduler are not sufficient, and presents the cases that deserve the negotiation of these multipath transmission features which are currently not addressed by MPTCP.</description>
