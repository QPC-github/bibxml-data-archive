    <description>This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or more BGP based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) sites in a scalable fashion over an IP-only network.  The motivation is to support extension of EVPN sites without having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS.  The requirements for such a deployment are very similar to the ones specified in RFC 7209 -- "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)".</description>
