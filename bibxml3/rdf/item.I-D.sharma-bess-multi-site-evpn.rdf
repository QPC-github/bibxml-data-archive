        <description>This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or more Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs) via NVO over IP-only network. The solution interconnects Ethernet VPN network by using NVO with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to facilitate the interconnect in a scalable fashion. The motivation is to support extension of Layer-2 and Layer- 3, Unicast &amp; Multicast, VPNs without having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS. The requirements for the interconnect are similar to the ones specified in [RFC7209] "Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)". In particular, this document describes the difference of the Gateways (GWs) procedure and incremental functionality from [RFC9014] "Interconnect Solution for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Overlay Networks", which this solution is interoperable to. This document updates and replaces all previous version of [SHARMA-MULTI-SITE].</description>
