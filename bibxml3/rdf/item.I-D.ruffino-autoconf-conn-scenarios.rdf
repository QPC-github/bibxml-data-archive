    <title>"Connectivity Scenarios for MANET", Simone Ruffino</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ruffino-autoconf-conn-scenarios-00.txt</link>
    <description>This Internet Draft aims at describing a wide spread set of possible connectivity scenarios involving mobile ad-hoc networks, in order to provide a reference for the AUTOCONF Working Group. The aspects considered for definition and classification of the scenarios are number and characteristics of the gateways that connect MANET nodes to external networks. Analysis will range from a scenario where no connectivity is provided, i.e. an isolated MANET, to more complex scenario where a MANET has multiple mobile gateways.</description>
