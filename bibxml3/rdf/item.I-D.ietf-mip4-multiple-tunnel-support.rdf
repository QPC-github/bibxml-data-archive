    <description>This specification defines extensions to Mobile IP protocol for allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple IP tunnels with its home agent.  This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available network interfaces and build an higher aggregated logical pipe with its home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate IP traffic flow policies for binding individual flows with the registered care-of addresses.</description>
