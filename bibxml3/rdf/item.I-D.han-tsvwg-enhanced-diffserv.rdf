    <description>There are real-time applications requiring deterministic services in terms of bandwidth and latency in various industries, such as network based AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial internet.  This document proposes a solution which enhances DiffServ in IPv6 to provide end to end bandwidth guaranteed service and latency guaranteed service.</description>
