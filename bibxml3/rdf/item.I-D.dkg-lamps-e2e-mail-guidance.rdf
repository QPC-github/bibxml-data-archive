        <description>End-to-end cryptographic protections for e-mail messages can provide useful security.  However, the standards for providing cryptographic protection are extremely flexible.  That flexibility can trap users and cause surprising failures.  This document offers guidance for mail user agent implementers that need to compose or interpret e-mail messages with end-to-end cryptographic protection.  It provides a useful set of vocabulary as well as suggestions to avoid common failures.</description>
