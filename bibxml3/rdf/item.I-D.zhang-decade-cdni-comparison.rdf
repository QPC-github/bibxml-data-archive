    <description>This document gives a brief comparison of DECADE and CDNi, two working groups on content delivery.  CDNi aims at overcoming the limited resource and footprints of a single CDN by interconnecting multiple CDNs.  While DECADE is mainly concerned with reducing the last-mile bandwidth bottleneck and inter-domain traffics with in- network storage.  This in-network storage can also be utilized by Content Service Providers (CSPs) as a CDN, whose footprints be across multiple Internet Service Providers (CSPs).  In this sense, DECADE can also be a possible approach to overcome the limited footprints of a single CDN.  This document attempts to gain some understanding on the relationship of these two solutions.</description>
