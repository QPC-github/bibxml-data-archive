    <title>"Enabling the IESG Chair to Resolve Personality or Other Problems", John  Klensin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klensin-chair-empowerment-00.txt</link>
    <description>From time to time, there have been complaints about internal conflicts within the IESG that have retarded projects. Some IETF Chairs have expressed frustration about not being able to resolve the problems and several members of the community have expressed frustration that the Chairs cannot do so. The recall process has not been effective in either dealing with or deterring these problems. This document proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate model whose intent is to give the Chair some leverage on solving any such problems that may arise in the future.</description>
