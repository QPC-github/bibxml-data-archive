    <description>A Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a file describing the expected use of a class of devices, usually an Internet of Things class of devices.  It is prepared by a manufacturer and placed on a generally available web server, and is addressable via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  The URI is often included in a discovery protocol (e.g., DNS, LLDP).  A Network Access Server (NAS) in the path of the discovery protocol can collect and forward the URI to a RADIUS server, which processes the URI.  This draft defines the RADIUS extension needed for the NAS to forward the URI to the RADIUS server.</description>
