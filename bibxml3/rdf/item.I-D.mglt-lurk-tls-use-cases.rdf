    <description>TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer between a TLS Client and a TLS Server.  In most cases, the TLS Server both terminates the TLS Connection and owns the authentication credentials necessary to authenticate the TLS Connection.  This document provides use cases where these two functions are split into different entities, i.e. the TLS Connection is terminated on an Edge Server, while authentication credentials are generated by a Key Server, that owns the Private Key.</description>
