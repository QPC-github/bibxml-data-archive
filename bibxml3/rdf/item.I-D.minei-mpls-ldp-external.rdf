    <description>In order to create forwarding state for a FEC received from a downstream LSR, LDP requires the presence of a matching entry in the routing table. This document describes a mechanism that allows the creation of LDP signaled LSPs for prefixes which are not present in the routing table. This draft is applicable to address prefix FECs and host FECs associated with either IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.</description>
