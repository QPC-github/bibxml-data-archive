    <title>"DHCP option to transport Protocol Configuration Options", Telemaco Melia, Yacine Mghazli</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melia-dhc-pco-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies how to convey Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) [24008] from/to the access network to/from the Mobile Node (MN).  There are scenarios defined in 3GPP (TS 23.402) and WiMax forum NWG where the mobile node accessing the non-3GPP trusted system needs to convey such information to the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) functionality implemented in the serving gateway (S-GW).  The MAG requires the PCO field to send such information to the Local Mobility Agent (LMA) (implemented in the PDN gateway, P-GW) in a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message.  PCO options are exchanged between the MN and the LMA to transport information such as P-CSCF address, DNS server address.</description>
