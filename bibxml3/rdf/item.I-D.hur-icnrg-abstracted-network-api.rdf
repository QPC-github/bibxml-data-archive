    <description>draft-hur-icnrg-abstracted-network-api-00.txt  In information-centric networking (ICN), well designed API will play a pivotal role in adopting ICN to applications. Traditional network API – i.e., current Socket implementation - is coupled between applications and underlying protocols, so it is hard to change one without changing the other, thus it could be solved by redesigning the network API in a way that decouples application-specific functions from network specific functions. In this draft, we addressed the network API modeling issues which can be also applied to the design of ICN APIs and proposed iPlug and dSocket API which help injection of applications’ intent and hide underlying network specific mechanisms, respectively.</description>
