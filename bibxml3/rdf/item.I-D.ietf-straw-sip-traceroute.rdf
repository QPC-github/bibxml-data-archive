    <title>"A Media-based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Hadriel Kaplan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-straw-sip-traceroute-03.txt</link>
    <description>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field to determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated that result in media being looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of performing hop- by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback mechanism to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media- relaying B2BUAs.</description>
