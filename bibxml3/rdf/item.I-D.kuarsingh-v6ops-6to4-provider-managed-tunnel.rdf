    <description>6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework which can help manage 6to4 tunnels operating in an anycast configuration. The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option for operators to help improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT provides a stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix Translation.  This operation may be particularly important in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-RFC1918 address thus breaking the return path for anycast based 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT has successfully been used in a production network, has been implemented as open source code, and implemented by a major routing vendor.</description>
