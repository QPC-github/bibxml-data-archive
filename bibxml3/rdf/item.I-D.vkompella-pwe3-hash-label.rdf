    <description>V. Kompella  Expires August 2008  [page 1]  Internet-Draft  Hashing on Pseudowires  February 2008  This draft proposes a method to introduce granularity on the  hashing of traffic running over pseudowires.  Most forwarding  engines are able to hash based on label stacks, so the approach  here is to introduce additional labels that do not affect the  handling of packets, but which identify a conversation, and can  be hashed with granularity.</description>
