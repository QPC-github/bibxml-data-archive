    <title>"SeND Hash Threat Analysis", Ana Kukec, Suresh Krishnan, Sheng Jiang</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kukec-csi-hash-threat-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document analysis the use of hashes in SeND, possible threats and the impact of recent attacks on hash functions used by SeND. Current SeND specification [rfc3971] uses SHA-1 [sha-1] hash algorithm and PKIX certificates [rfc3280] and does not provide support for the hash algorithm agility.  Based on previous analysis, this document suggests multiple hash support that should be included in the SeND update specification.</description>
