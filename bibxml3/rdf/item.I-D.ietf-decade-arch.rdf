    <description>Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications) are widely used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  One technique to improve the network efficiency of these applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the networks; this is the capability provided by a DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) compatible system.  This document presents an architecture, discusses the underlying principles, and identifies key functionalities in the architecture for introducing a DECADE in- network storage system.  In addition, some examples are given to illustrate these concepts.</description>
