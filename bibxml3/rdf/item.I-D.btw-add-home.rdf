    <description>The document specifies new DHCP and IPv6 Router Advertisement options to discover encrypted DNS servers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over- TLS, DNS-over-QUIC).  Particularly, it allows to learn an authentication domain name together with a list of IP addresses and a port number to reach such encrypted DNS servers.  The discovery of DNS-over-HTTPS URI Templates is also discussed.</description>
