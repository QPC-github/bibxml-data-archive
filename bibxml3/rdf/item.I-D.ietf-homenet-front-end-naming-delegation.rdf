        <description>Home owners often have IPv6 devices that they wish to access over the Internet using names. Outsourcing the DNS servers to a DNS infrastructure protects against possible DDoS attacks as well as sudden renumbering of the home network.  It has been possible to register and populate a DNS Zone with names since DNS became a thing, but it has been an activity typically reserved for experts.  This document automates the process through creation of a Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), whose responsibility is to select, sign and publish names to a set of publicly visible servers.  This document describes the mechanism that enables the HNA to outsource the naming service to the DNS Outsourcing Infrastructure (DOI) via a Distribution Manager (DM).  In addition, this document deals with publication of a corresponding reverse zone.</description>
