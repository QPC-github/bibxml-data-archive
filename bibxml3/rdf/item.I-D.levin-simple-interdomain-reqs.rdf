    <description>This document identifies a SIP/SIMPLE profile for inter-domain communications and documents best current practices regarding security and "good citizenship" behavior that operators should use when interconnecting two or more clouds using SIP/SIMPLE. The purpose of this document is to serve as the reference for the SIP/ SIMPLE community towards inter-domain interoperability and also to identify new requirements specific to the inter-domain interface.</description>
