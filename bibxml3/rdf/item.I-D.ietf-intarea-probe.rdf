    <title>"PROBE: A Utility For Probing Interfaces", Ron Bonica, Reji Thomas, J. Linkova, Chris Lenart, Mohamed Boucadair</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-intarea-probe-10.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a network diagnostic tool called PROBE. PROBE is similar to PING, in that it can be used to query the status of a probed interface.  It differs from PING in that it does not require bidirectional connectivity between the probing and probed interfaces.  Instead, PROBE requires bidirectional connectivity between the probing interface and a proxy interface.  The proxy interface can reside on the same node as the probed interface or it can reside on a node to which the probed interface is directly connected.  This document updates RFC 4884.</description>
