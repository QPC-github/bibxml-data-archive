    <title>"TCP Extensions for Immediate Retransmissions", Lars Eggert</title>

    <description>This document classifies connectivity disruptions along an end-to-end path into four types and describes how standard TCP mechanisms can lead to inefficient or over-aggressive sending behavior when connectivity resumes. The proposed techniques for TCP mobility detection and response (LMDR) can improve behavior for some types of disruptions. This document describes another, complementary and orthogonal modification to TCP's retransmission scheme that improves performance for disruption types that TCP LMDR does not address. This extension is based on connectivity indicators, i.e., generic network events that may indicate that end-to-end connectivity has resumed. This document focuses on TCP modifications that use connectivity indicators to increase performance, but does not define the specifics of such connectivity indicators itself.</description>
