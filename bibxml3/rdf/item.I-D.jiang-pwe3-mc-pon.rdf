    <description>MPLS is being deployed deeper into operator networks, often to or past the access network node. Separately network access nodes such as PON OLTs have evolved to support first-mile access protection, where one or more physical OLTs provide first-mile diversity to the customer edge. Multi-homing support is needed on the MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services.  This document describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture in MPLS and also proposes the ICCP extension to support it.</description>
