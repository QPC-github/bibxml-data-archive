    <title>"Problem Statement: Configuration of IP services for IPDVB", Martin  Stiemerling</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stiemerling-ipdvb-config-02.txt</link>
    <description>Future IPDVB networks will require a more powerful configuration management of IP addresses and related networking parameters as it is currently provided in such networks. Current discussions within the IPDVB working group have shown that the future usage scenarios and requirements for dynamic configuration management are not yet clearly defined. This memo identifies the problem space for dynamic configuration of IP networking parameters in IPDVB networks.</description>
