    <description>Currently, if an internal server and hosts are behind NAT, they cannot share a global IP address except adding lots of static NAPT rule configuration.  Because if a server wants to provide a service by constant port(i.e. HTTP and FTP) , the destination port of packet sent by an external client should not be changed when it crosses NAT. This document specifies a new method to assign NAPT global address and port, aiming to solve the problem that internal servers and hosts cannot share less global IP addresses.</description>
