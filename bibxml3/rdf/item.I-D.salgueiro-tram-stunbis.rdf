    <description>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.  STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them.  STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.  This document obsoletes RFC 5389.</description>
