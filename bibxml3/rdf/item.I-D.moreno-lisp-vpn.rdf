    <title>"LISP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)", Victor Moreno, Dino Farinacci</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-moreno-lisp-vpn-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  LISP is used to provide segmentation in both the LISP data plane and control plane. These VPNs can be created over the top of the Internet or over private transport networks, and can be implemented by Enterprises or Service Providers.  The goal of these VPNs is to leverage the characteristics of LISP - routing scalability, simply expressed Ingress site TE Policy, IP Address Family traversal, and mobility, in ways that provide value to network operators.</description>
