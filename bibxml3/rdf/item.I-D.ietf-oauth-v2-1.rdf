        <title>"The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework", Dick Hardt, Aaron Parecki, Torsten Lodderstedt</title>

        <description>The OAuth 2.1 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and an authorization service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework described in RFC 6749.</description>
