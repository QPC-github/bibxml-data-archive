    <title>"IPv6-only and Dual Stack Hosts on the Same Network with DNS64", Dan Wing</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wing-behave-dns64-config-03.txt</link>
    <description>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPv6-only hosts at the same time.  Such networks also want to IPv6/ IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on the IPv4 Internet.  On such a network, the synthesized AAAA responses from a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated.  This document describes a solution to avoid that translation when the application uses DNS.</description>
