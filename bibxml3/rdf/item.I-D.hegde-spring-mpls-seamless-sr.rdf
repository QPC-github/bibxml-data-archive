        <description>This draft documents a set of use cases and requirements for end-to- end intent-based paths spanning multi-domain packet networks.  The document explicitly focuses on use cases that require high scale and availability, which will likely benefit from distributed solutions. It is intended that the requirements in this document serve as a basis for future IETF work to develop distributed solutions for inter-domain intent-based transport paths.</description>
