    <description>As time synchronization protocols are becoming increasingly common and widely deployed, concern about their exposure to various security threats is increasing. This document defines a set of requirements for security solutions for time synchronization protocols, focusing on the IEEE 1588 and NTP. This document also discusses the security impacts of time synchronization protocol practices, the time synchronization performance implications of external security practices, the dependencies between other security services and time synchronization.</description>
