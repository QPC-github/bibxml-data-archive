    <description>EAP Session-Id derivation has not been defined for EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, and EAP-AKA' when using the fast re-authentication exchange instead of full authentication.  This document updates [RFC5247] to define those derivations for EAP-SIM, and EAP-AKA.  Since [AKAP] defines the Session-ID for EAP-AKA', the definition for EAP-AKA' is not included here.  [RFC5247] also does not define Session-Id derivation for PEAP. A definition is given here which follows the definition for other TLS-based EAP methods.</description>
