    <title>"End-Host Mobility and Multihoming with the Host Identity Protocol", Tom  Henderson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-hip-mm-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines mobility and multihoming extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached.  This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a HIP host-- the process by which a host dynamically changes the primary locator that it uses to receive packets.  While the same LOCATOR parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are left for further study.</description>
