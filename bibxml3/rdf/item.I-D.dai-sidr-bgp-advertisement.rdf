    <description>SIDR working group is working on an extended architecture for interdomain routing security framework. One of the functions that this architecture should provide is origin authentication of prefixes for BGP, i.e. a BGP speaker must be able to determine whether an AS (autonomous system) is authorized to originate certain prefixes. This draft documents some ideas from the perspective of internal control in order to alleviate this problem.</description>
