    <title>"Diameter Support for EAP Re-authentication Protocol", Lakshminath Dondeti</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dondeti-dime-erp-diameter-02.txt</link>
    <description>An EAP extension, called "EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)", has been specified that supports an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the peer and the server through an authenticator.  This document specifies Diameter support for ERP. The Diameter EAP application is re-used for encapsulating the newly defined EAP Initiate and EAP Finish messages specified in the ERP specification.  AVPs for request and delivery of Domain Specific Root Keys from the AAA/EAP server to the ER server are also specified. Additionally, this document also specifies Diameter processing rules relevant to ERP.</description>
