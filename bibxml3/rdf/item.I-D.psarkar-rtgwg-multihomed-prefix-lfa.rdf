    <description>This document shares experience gained from implementing algorithms to determine Loop-Free Alternates for multi-homed prefixes.  In particular, this document provides explicit inequalities that can be used to evaluate neighbors as a potential alternates for multi-homed prefixes.  It also provides detailed criteria for evaluating potential alternates for external prefixes advertised by OSPF ASBRs.</description>
