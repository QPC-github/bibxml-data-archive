    <title>"RFC 4389 Should be a Standard", Hemant Singh, Wes Beebee</title>

    <description>Increasingly the need for IPv6 ND Proxy [RFC4389]) to be a Standards Track document is growing.  During the specification of the IPv6 CE Router in the IETF v6ops Working Group, the IPv6 CE Router has use for ND Proxy to bridge disparate MAC layers LAN ports.  There is also the use of ND Proxy in cable broadband NBMA network for DAD and ND address resolution on a cable access concentrator.  Another case where ND Proxy is required is when one does not have enough IPv6 address space to route.  This short note recommends that the ND Proxy RFC be changed to a Standards Track document.</description>
