    <description>Without doubt the Internet infrastructure developed far beyond the expectations of the original funding agencies, architects, developers, and early users.  The society's current use and expectations often lead to the need to take the economical and political context in which technology is deployed into consideration.  This document aims to make protocol designers aware of the public policy-related questions that may impact standards development.  This document contains questions, as opposed to guidelines or strict rules that should in all cases be followed.  This document provides a framework for identifying and discussing questions of public policy concern and serves as an umbrella for related policy documents.</description>
