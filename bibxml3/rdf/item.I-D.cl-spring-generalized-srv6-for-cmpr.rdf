        <description>This document proposes Generalized Segment Routing over IPv6 (G-SRv6) Networking Programming for SRv6 compression.  G-SRv6 can reduce the overhead of SRv6 by encoding the Generalized SIDs(G-SID) in SID list, and it also supports to program SRv6 SIDs and G-SIDs in a single SRH to support incremental deployment and smooth upgrade.  G-SRv6 is fully compatible with SRv6 with no modification of SRH, no new address consumption, no new route creation, and even no modification of control plane.  G-SRv6 for Compression is designed based on the Compressed SRv6 Segment List Encoding in SRH [I-D.filsfilscheng-spring-srv6-srh-compression] framework.</description>
