    <title>"Using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)", Martin Thomson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-thomson-mmusic-ice-webrtc-01.txt</link>
    <description>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been selected as the basis for establishing peer-to-peer UDP flows between Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) clients.  Using an unmodified ICE implementation in this context enables the use of the web platform as a denial of service platform.  The risks and complications arising from this choice are discussed.  A modified algorithm for sending ICE connectivity checks from the web platform is described.</description>
