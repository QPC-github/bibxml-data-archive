    <description>Some network operators build and operate data centers that support over one hundred thousand servers.  In this document, such data centers are referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures.  Environments of this scale have a unique set of network requirements with an emphasis on operational simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes operational experience in designing and operating large-scale data centers using BGP as the only routing protocol.  The intent is to report on a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</description>
