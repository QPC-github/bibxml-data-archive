    <title>"Clarifications for the use of REFER with RFC6665", Robert Sparks, Adam Roach</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipcore-refer-clarifications-04.txt</link>
    <description>The SIP REFER method relies on the SIP-Specific Event Notification Framework.  That framework was revised by RFC6665.  This document highlights the implications of the requirement changes in RFC6665, and updates the definition of the REFER method, RFC3515, to clarify and disambiguate the impact of those changes.</description>
