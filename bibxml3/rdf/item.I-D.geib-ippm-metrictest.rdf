    <description>This document specifies tests to determine if multiple independent instantiations of a performance metric RFC have implemented the specifications in the same way.  This is the performance metric equivalent of interoperability, required to advance RFCs along the standards track.  Results from different implementations of metric RFCs will be collected under the same underlying network conditions and compared using state of the art statistical methods.  The goal is an evaluation of the metric RFC itself, whether its definitions are clear and unambiguous to implementors and therefore a candidate for advancement on the IETF standards track.</description>
