    <description>This memo documents an extension of the OSPF protocol to reach "ExStart" state more quickly. Currently, the OSPF behavior requires the Hello Packet to be sent between the neighbors every HelloInterval. This document proposes to generalize the use of Immediately Replying Hello which could reduce the time required to reach the OSPF "ExStart" state and expedite the routing table convergence.</description>
