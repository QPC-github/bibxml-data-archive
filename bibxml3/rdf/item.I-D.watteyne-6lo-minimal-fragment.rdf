    <description>This document gives an overview of LLN Minimal Fragment Forwarding. When employing adaptation layer fragmentation in 6LoWPAN, it may be beneficial for a forwarder not to have to reassemble each packet in its entirety before forwarding it.  This has been always possible with the original fragmentation design of RFC4944.  This document is a companion document to [I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly], which details the virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) implementation technique which reduces the latency and increases end-to-end reliability in route-over forwarding.</description>
