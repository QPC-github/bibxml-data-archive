    <title>"SHIM - MIPv6 Interaction", Marcelo Bagnulo, Erik Nordmark</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bagnulo-shim6-mip-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this note, we explore the interaction between the SHIM protocol and MIPv6 protocol, identifying potential benefits and difficulties. The analysis will consider the two modes of operation of MIPv6: the Bidirectional Tunnel (BT) mode where the communication is routed through the Home Agent and the Route Optimization (RO) mode, where the communication flows directly between the Correspondent node and the mobile node.</description>
