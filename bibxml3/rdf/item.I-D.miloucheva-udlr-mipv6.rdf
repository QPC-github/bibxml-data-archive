    <title>"Support of mobile nodes with unidirectional links in MIPv6", Ilka  Miloucheva, Olaf Menzel</title>

    <description>This document discusses mechanisms for dynamic establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of mobile nodes with unidirectional links in Mobile Ipv6 (MIPv6) environment. Requirements are derived from the need to support services in mobile Ipv6 based on unidirectional technologies, for instance Digital Video Broadcasting, using multicast protocols, such as Protocol Independent Multicast Routing – Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2).</description>
