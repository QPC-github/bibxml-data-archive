    <title>"RFC 4148 and the IPPM Metrics Registry are Obsolete", Al Morton</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-morton-ippm-rfc4148-obsolete-03.txt</link>
    <description>This memo reclassifies RFC 4148, the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Registry as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry itself from use because it is obsolete.  The current registry structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no one has responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148 registry during the second half of 2010.</description>
