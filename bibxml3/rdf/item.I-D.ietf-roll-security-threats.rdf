    <description>This document presents a security threat analysis for the Routing Protocol for Low-power and lossy networks (RPL, ROLL).  The development builds upon previous work on routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues and constraints specific to low-power and lossy networks.  A systematic approach is used in defining and evaluating the security threats.  Applicable countermeasures are application specific and are addressed in relevant applicability statements.</description>
