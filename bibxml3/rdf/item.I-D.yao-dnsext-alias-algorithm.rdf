    <description>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has been developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs use an 8-bit number to identify the security algorithm being used.  More and more new RRTYPEs will appear in future.  This document defines an alias algorithm identifier assignment method for DNSSEC 8-bit algorithm numbers.</description>
