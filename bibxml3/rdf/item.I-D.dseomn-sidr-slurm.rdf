    <title>"Simplified Local internet nUmber Resource Management with the RPKI", David Mandelberg</title>

    <description>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those resources.  Network operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route origination assertions.  In the future, ISPs also will be able to use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP route.  Some ISPs locally use BGP with private address space or private AS numbers (see RFC6890).  These local BGP routes cannot be verified by the global RPKI, and SHOULD be considered invalid based on the global RPKI (see RFC6491).  The mechanisms described below provide ISPs with a way to make local assertions about private (reserved) INRs while using the RPKI's assertions about all other INRs.</description>
