    <description>Multi-Topologies (MTs) can be used for computing different paths for unicast traffic, multicast traffic, different classes of service based on flexible criteria, or an in-band network management topology.  This document proposes the multi-topology segment for segment routing.  MRT FRR using multi-topology segment is described as the use case to explains the procedures of the forwarding plane and the control plane for multi-topology segment..</description>
