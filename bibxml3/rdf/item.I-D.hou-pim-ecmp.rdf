    <description>A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface and router to build forwarding state.  When there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP), existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path.  Such algorithms do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics.  This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.  This document introduces the ECMP Assert, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs.  It allows ECMP path selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences and routing metrics.</description>
