    <description>This document defines Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling extensions to support Fast Reroute (FRR) of Packet Switched Capable (PSC) Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  These signaling extensions allow the coordination of bidirectional bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse directions of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.  In addition, these extensions enable the re-direction of bidirectional traffic and signaling onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data and signaling paths in the forward and reverse directions after FRR to avoid RSVP soft-state timeout.</description>
