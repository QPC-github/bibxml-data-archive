        <title>"The Universal IPv6 Configuration Option", Timothy Winters, Ole Troan</title>
        <dc:date>2021-10-22T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately that hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options are added to RAs.  This document proposes a new universal option for RA in a self-describing data format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.</description>
