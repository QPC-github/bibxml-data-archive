    <description>This document defines the framework for CCDR traffic engineering within Native IP network, using Dual/Multi-BGP session strategy and PCE-based central control architecture.  The proposed central mode control framework conforms to the concept that defined in RFC " An Architecture for Use of PCE and the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) in a Network with Central Control".  The scenario and simulation results of CCDR traffic engineering is described in draft "CCDR Scenario, Simulation and Suggestion".</description>
