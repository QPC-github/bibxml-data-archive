    <description>To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements requested by today's IP-services the control and management of DWDM interfaces is a precondition for enhanced multilayer networking and for an further automation of network provisioning and operation. This document describes use cases and requirements for the control and management of optical interfaces parameters according to different types of single channel DMDM interfaces.  The focus is on automating the network provisioning process irrespective on how it is triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS or GMPLS.  This document covers management as well as control plane considerations in different management cases of a single channel DWDM interface The purpose is to identify the necessary information elements and processes to be used by control or management systems for further processing.</description>
