    <description>This document first discusses the use of locators and identifiers in mobility management architectures, and their implication on various anchorless properties.  A new architecture is then proposed that is purely based on identifiers, and more specifically names as defined in Hybrid-ICN (hICN).  The document then focuses on two main cases: the end-point sends data (data producer) or the end-point receives data (data consumer).  These two cases are taken into account entirely to provide anchorless mobility management in hICN.</description>
