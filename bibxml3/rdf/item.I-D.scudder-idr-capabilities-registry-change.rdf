    <description>This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three new ranges, respectively designated as "First Come First Served", "Experimental" and "Reserved".</description>
