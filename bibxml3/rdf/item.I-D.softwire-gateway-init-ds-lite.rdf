    <description>Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack lite (GI-DS-lite) is a modified approach to the original Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) applicable to certain tunnel-based access architectures.  GI-DS-lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the access gateway to an IPv4-IPv4 NAT using softwires with an embedded context identifier, that uniquely identifies the end-system the tunneled packets belong to.  The access gateway determines which portion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies and sends/receives this portion to/from this softwire tunnel.</description>
