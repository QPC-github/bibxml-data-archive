    <description>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, to inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client will wait a response to its request.  A CoAP server can use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</description>
