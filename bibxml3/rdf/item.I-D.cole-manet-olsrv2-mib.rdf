    <description>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring and managing aspects of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol version 2.  The Optimized Link State Routing MIB also reports state information, performance metrics, and notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance information is useful to management stations troubleshooting Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks routing problems.</description>
