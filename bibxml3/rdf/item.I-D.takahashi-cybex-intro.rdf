    <description>The cybersecurity information exchange framework, known as CYBEX, is currently undergoing its first iteration of standardization efforts within ITU-T.  The framework describes how cybersecurity information is exchanged between cybersecurity entities on a global scale and how the exchange is assured.  This framework is intended to facilitate cybersecurity entities to work together beyond national and/or organizational boundaries.  Currently, ITU-T Draft Recommendation X.1500 defines the framework. The editors designated for the progress of the Draft Recommendation are (in alphabetical order): Inette Furey (DHS), Youki Kadobayashi (NICT), Bob Martin (MITRE), Angela Mckay (Microsoft), Stephen Adegbite (FIRST), Damir Rajnovic (FIRST), Gavin Reid (Cisco), Tony Rutkowski (Yaana), Gregg Schudel (Cisco).  On behalf of ITU-T Q.4/17, this draft introduces the overview of CYBEX in the IETF.</description>
