    <title>"Thoughts a New Transport Encapsulation Architecture", Brian Trammell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-trammell-stackevo-newtea-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document explores architectural considerations for using encapsulation in support of stack evolution and new transport protocol deployment in an increasingly encrypted Internet.  These architectural considerations are based on an idealized architecture where all interactions among applications, endpoints, and the path occur explicitly, with this cooperation enforced cryptographically. This idealized architecture is then lensed through the state of devices in the present Internet and how they would impair the deployability of such an architecture, in order to support an incremental deployment of this approach.</description>
