    <description>Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure that mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. [Pierce] describes the requirements, one of which is to provide preferential treatment to higher priority calls. IEPS refers to a set of capabilities used to provide a higher probability of call completion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel, usually from ordinary telephones.
