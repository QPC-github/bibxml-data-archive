    <title>"MOBIKE Extensions for PF_KEY", Udo Schilcher</title>

    <description>PF_KEY is a generic key management API used for communication between a trusted user level key management daemon and a key engine within the operating system. With the extension of IKEv2 for mobility and multihoming (MOBIKE) the existing capabilities of PF_KEY with regard to the creation, maintenance and deletion of security associations became insufficient. This document defines an extension to update an entity in the security association database. Additionally, it is necessary to reflect the newly offered integrity and encryption algorithms with IKEv2 in PF_KEY.</description>
