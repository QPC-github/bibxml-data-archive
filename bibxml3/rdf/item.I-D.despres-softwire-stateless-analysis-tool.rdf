    <description>This document proposes a discussion tool for the Softwire meeting at IETF 84 in Vancouver.  Significant differentiating features between the MAP approach (proposed standards MAP-T and MAP-E) and the unified approach (proposed standard 4rd) are presented in tabular format.  Its purpose is to facilitate decision making, and is therefore temporary.</description>
