    <title>"Too Many Requests Response Code for the Constrained Application Protocol", Ari Keranen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-core-too-many-reqs-06.txt</link>
    <description>A Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) server can experience temporary overload because one or more clients are sending requests to the server at a higher rate than the server is capable or willing to handle.  This document defines a new CoAP Response Code for a server to indicate that a client should reduce the rate of requests.</description>
