    <title>"Off-Path Signaling Protocol for Service Function Chaining", Mauro Femminella, Gianluca Reali, Dario Valocchi</title>

    <description>This document illustrates a reference protocol able to discover deployed instances of Service Functions (SFs), which can be located also off-path with respect to the IP datapath between flow source and flow destination. It is an application protocol organized in two layers: signaling transport, which deal lower layer signaling transport, and signaling application, which directly interfaces with the intended SF. Discovery of SFs is a primary step to for implementing Service Function Chaining (SFC).</description>
