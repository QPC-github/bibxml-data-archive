    <description>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used in a large number of different application domains and environments.  This heterogeneity implies that different security mechanisms are needed to provide services such as confidentiality, integrity and source authentication of RTP/RTCP packets suitable for the various environments.  The range of solutions makes it difficult for RTP-based application developers to pick the most suitable mechanism.  This document provides an overview of a number of security solutions for RTP, and gives guidance for developers on how to choose the appropriate security mechanism.</description>
