    <description>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network- performance criteria (e.g., latency) are becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics.  This document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering Extensions (RFC 5305) such that network-performance information can be distributed and collected in a scalable fashion.  The information distributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions can then be used to make path-selection decisions based on network performance.  Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network-performance information is distributed.  The mechanisms for measuring network performance or acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.  This document obsoletes RFC 7810.</description>
