    <title>"End-to-End Session Identification in IP-Based Multimedia Communication Networks", Paul Jones, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Chris Pearce, Paul Giralt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-insipid-session-id-27.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes an end-to-end Session Identifier for use in IP-based multimedia communication systems that enables endpoints, intermediary devices, and management systems to identify a session end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected, and associate one or more media flows with a given communication session.  While the identifier is intended to work across multiple protocols, this document describes its usage in SIP.  This document also describes a backwards compatibility mechanism for an existing session identifier implementation (RFC 7329) that is sufficiently different from the procedures defined in this document.  This document obsoletes RFC 7329.</description>
