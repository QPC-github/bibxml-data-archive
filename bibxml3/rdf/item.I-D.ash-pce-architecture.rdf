    <title>"Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture", Adrian Farrel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ash-pce-architecture-01.txt</link>
    <description>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain, multi-region or multi-layers networks is highly complex and may require special computational components and cooperation between the different network domains. This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space.</description>
